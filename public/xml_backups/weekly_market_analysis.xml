		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

Do you want the peace of mind that comes from owning gold you can physically hold in your hand? Gold has survived inflation, deflation, financial crises, and natural disasters over the centuries.

The most traditional way of investing in gold is by buying bullion gold bars, although gold coins are also a common way of owning gold. Bullion coins are priced according to their fine weight, plus a premium based on supply and demand.  The  most widely collected coins include but are not limited to the Krugerrand, Australian Gold Nugget (Kangaroo), Austrian Philharmonic, Austrian 100 Corona, Canadian Gold Maple Leaf, Chinese Gold Panda, Mexican Gold 50 Peso, British Sovereign, American Gold Eagle, and the American Buffalo.
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gold.png"><img class=" wp-image-125 alignright" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gold-200x300.png" alt="gold" width="214" height="321" /></a><strong>LEARN HOW TO INVEST IN GOLD</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>TIPS ON SMART INVESTING:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Do you already have an IRA as part of your investment portfolio? Invest in gold and transfer it to your IRA without any penalties. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 provides tax relief for retirement accounts.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Consider storage while determining your investment strategy. You can store your gold at a bank, in your or home, or any place you deem safe. There are fees associated to the storage of your bullion which may dictate your purchase power.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Buying gold coins is the most direct exposure to the physical asset as an investor can get.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Be knowledgeable of the product you are purchasing, gold rounds look exactly like gold coins but they have no currency value.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Address"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: windowtext;">Finally, while purchasing you may see that many products are manufactured at LBMA certified facilities. The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) enacted <em>The Good Delivery Rules for Gold and Silver Bars</em> which maintains a chain of custody for bullion products. The document includes specific requirements regarding the fineness, weight, dimensions, appearance, marks and production of gold and silver bars. </span></p>
<p class="Address"><strong>Buyer Beware: </strong></p>
<p class="Address"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: windowtext;">Gold attracts a fair amount of fraudulent activity which is why it is imperative to be knowledgeable of the gold being purchased, in addition to having it tested prior to completing any sale.</span></p>

		<title>Gold: Multi-Decade Breakout Underway</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The mainstream media is largely missing the significance of the moves we are now seeing in the precious metals sector.

Most readers will already be familiar with the fundamental factors impacting gold and silver prices: unsustainable government debt, negative interest rates, unwinnable overseas wars, and a worldwide fiat currency system that has no precedent in history.

Yet the focus of our work here is not to simply repeat the headlines impacting the day-to-day price of gold. For as we have seen from the 2011-2015 drop in precious metals, one can be very right on the fundamentals impacting the market, yet prices can move in the opposite direction for a prolonged period.

We must instead let the market tell us what it wants to do, and therefore we turn to a long-term technical perspective in order to observe the trends in gold.

<strong>Gold's Long-Term Pattern</strong>

Gold has just successfully retested its breakout from a multi-decade consolidation dating between 1980 and 2009, almost three decades during which the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">price</a> was held below $850 per troy ounce. The significance of such a breakout cannot be overstated: multi-decade consolidations and breakouts usually lead to multi-decade advances, with targets many times the previous consolidation high. When we view examples throughout history of markets that have experienced similar consolidations and advances, we see that in percentage terms gold in the mid-$1300 range has only just begun to move toward its full potential.

<strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-461" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Gold-price-between-1980-and-2009.png" alt="Gold-price-1980-2009" width="1136" height="500" /></strong>

<strong>A Historical Example in the Dow</strong>

The potential for a market that consolidates for several decades and then breaks out successfully must be appreciated. Let us view an example from history of a well-known market that went through a multi-decade consolidation and successful breakout, so as to assess the ramifications of this pattern for gold.

From 1959 to 1982, the <a href="https://www.google.com/finance?cid=983582">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> consolidated between roughly 550 and just over 1,000 points. It was a choppy consolidation, but it featured a clearly defined resistance zone near 1,000, as can be seen on the chart below. For these 23 years, no one with a buy and hold strategy for US stocks made much money, and many investors gave up hope of ever making a profit.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-462" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1959-1982-Dow-Jones-Industrial-Average.png" alt="1959-1982-Dow-Jones-Industrial-Average" width="757" height="500" />

However, in 1982 the Dow finally broke out above 1,000, hitting 1,300 in the fall of 1983. Its retest of the former 1,000 resistance zone was quick, lasting from late 1983 to mid 1984, and in fact, did not fall completely back to that exact price, only briefly touching 1,100 for a low.

Once that retest proved successful, the advance was quick to accelerate. The rest, as they say, was history, as one of the greatest bull markets continued on for <em>almost as long as the consolidation</em> -- 18 years total -- and achieved <em>over a 1,000% gain from the previous all-time high </em>(hitting 11,500 in the year 2000)<em>.</em>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-464" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Dow-Jones-Industrial-Average-increase.png" alt="Dow-Jones-Industrial-Average-increase" width="666" height="500" />

<strong>Back to Gold</strong>

Gold is now positioned similarly to where the Dow was in mid-1984, when it successfully retested the 1,000 level after breaking out from its multi-decade consolidation. Gold's retest occurred in December of last year, at $1,045 per ounce.

Let us rewind the specific chronology for gold that we are referring to:

Gold peaked in 1980 near $850 per troy once, only to fall back to $255 by the year 2000 after a series of rallies and further drops.

It then took gold nine years to climb back up to $850 and exceed that level for good.

We thus view the entire 1980 - 2009 period as a multi-decade consolidation below the $850 level, and the final break above this figure as the completion of this pattern. Again, multi-decade consolidations are rare formations in the capital markets, and they usually lead to advances that measure similar amounts of time.

After gold's breakout in 2009 it surged for two more years only, hitting a new peak in 2011 at $1,923.

The bear market from 2011 - 2015 occurred entirely above the multi-decade $850/oz consolidation, and thus constitutes a retest of the former high in technical analysis.

Note that gold, similar to the Dow, has shown relative strength by not falling all the way to the $850 level for its retest, instead forming a clear bottom at $1,045 in December 2015.

Gold subsequently broke out of its primary downtrend in late February (shown by the turquoise-color channel on the main chart above), and has just had its best six-month performance gain in 40 years, with a 24% advance from January through June 2016. We now zoom in on the final part of the bear market, and the breakout seen in February.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-465 size-large" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Gold-price-chart-2014-2016-1024x766.png" alt="Gold-price-chart-2014-2016" width="840" height="628" />

<strong>The Potential for Gold </strong>

To continue with the Dow analogy above, we are looking for an advance beginning in gold that should last for a similar length of time as the consolidation from 1980-2009. In other words, a multi-decade bull market in the precious metals sector is likely now starting.

While history does not repeat exactly in markets or in life, it often rhymes.

Thus, long-term investors in the precious metals would do well to take a step back from the day-to-day price fluctuations and truly contemplate the potential presented by the first chart in this article. While volatility and corrections should always be expected in any market, we believe there is a major opportunity now unfolding in the precious metals sector.

Trying to put exact numbers on a price target at this moment can only diminish the message of the underlying strength gold is showing. But for comparison purposes, if the precious metal were to achieve an 11-fold move above it's previous all-time high as the Dow did from 1982 - 2000, it would give us a target of over $9,000 per ounce. This would happen within the timespan of the next few decades.

Our point in this piece is not to encourage readers to obsess over the final target, but rather to see this market within the context of the unique multi-decade breakout that is currently unfolding.

This pattern is rare and powerful in the financial markets, and gold is positioned at the beginning of the setup right now.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I have seen other similar charts and have heard predictions of a bull market in precious metals for the next 14 years. I have not heard of a bull market in metals lasting 3 decades but that sounds great to me since I am heavily invested in bullion and rare coins. I even took about 25% of my stock market investments in my IRA and opened a bullion IRA that I started in 2009 with silver at $14 and gold at $900. It will be good to see the value of this IRA start to gain back what I earned through 2011 and keep growing. The stock market scares me big time and I feel much more comfortable being invested in metals although I do believe in being well diversified in my investments. I just don't understand the people that are scared of owning precious metals, something that will never be worth zero but I know how fast my stock market picks can go to zero when I bought a $10,000 bond in Lehman Bros. and most of us know what happened to them. They had A or better rating on a Friday and were bankrupt on the following Monday ending in a $10,000 loss! That will not happen with precious metals! So for those still not convinced just look at what happened to me. You should in my opinion own some hard assets like gold and silver that you keep at home or in a safety deposit box and don't wait until gold and silver are to expensive to purchase. Now is the time to own if you have not invested in metals yet and take at least 20% of your stock assets and diversify into metals. It's very easy to do with an IRA. Good luck!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Silver - Fundamentals Reveal Large Potential</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While we tend to focus on technical indicators in our analysis of the precious metals, in this article we will examine the fundamentals drivers within the silver market.

What are the trends amongst miners, scrappers, hedgers, jewelers, industrialists, and investors? What can we see setting up for silver -- a historically monetary metal, now with significant industrial demand -- over the next decade?

Our review follows: we are more bullish than ever on <strong>silver prices</strong> and believe that the moves we have seen over the last 10 years are a mere preview of the price level that is to come over the next decade. However, investors should expect high volatility, with 25-35% price swings every year going forward.

<strong>A Review of Silver's Fundamentals</strong>

A review of the fundamental case for silver reveals a bullish scenario for those investors with at least a several year timespan and the tolerance for this high volatility.

The scenario centers on an investment premium now being priced into a historically monetary metal that concurrently has the backdrop of significant industrial demand. This industrial demand is mostly inelastic at or even above current prices.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-524" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/a_Silverfundamentals.jpg" alt="world-silver-supply-demand" width="1500" height="1125" />

<strong>Mine Supply Growing Slowly</strong>

In reviewing the past ten years of data for silver (courtesy Thompson Reuters / The Silver Institute), we find overall supply that has increased 13% since 2006 to over one billion ounces per year (first orange row on chart above). Of that, mine supply has seen consistent year over year production increases to 886M oz., while government sales have flat lined, and scrap production is down 29% over the same time period.

The data shows that mine production is the key supply source, accounting for nearly 85% of the market. This mine supply, while slowly increasing, cannot respond to quick changes in demand, as the exploration-development-extraction lifecycle for mining companies can take well over a decade to bring new silver to the market.

<strong>Silver Fabrication Demand is Inelastic</strong>

Turning to the demand side, we see that net physical demand for silver has increased roughly 13% in the past 10 years, again to over a billion ounces per year (second orange row on the chart above). While silverware use is flat and overall industrial fabrication is down slightly, zooming in on the details here gives us much more insight as to the emerging long-term trends.

The bulk of the industrial drop comes from photographic use for silver, which has fallen by over 67%, to a low of 46 million ounces in 2015. At the same time, electronic fabrication is up 2% to 246M oz., and photovoltaic use has gone from negligible to over 77M oz.

<em>The key then is to note that the bulk of the industrial drop has already occurred</em> -- in the photographic category. At current decline rates, it will only take a few more years for photographic use to be negligible. <strong>The rest of the industrial side taken as a sum shows increased demand over the last 10 years.</strong>

This increased industrial demand is largely inelastic, as can be seen by the fact that the increase has occurred during a time when silver prices have moved from an average of $6 per ounce to nearly $20 today. The reason for the inelasticity is that for most industrial applications, there is not a suitable replacement for silver. For example: in solar panels, computers, and cell phones, the total cost for silver in the manufactured components is such a small fraction of the overall materials cost, yet so essential for production, that it does not matter whether the price is $6, $20, or significantly higher.

There exists no acceptable substitute.

<strong>Silver Investment Demand is the Key Price Driver</strong>

On the investment side (highlighted in green on the chart above), the most significant item to note is that demand for coins and bars has risen nearly six-fold over the last decade to 292M oz. This demand sits at the margin, and is by far the most variable; for example falling 35% from 2011 to 2012, before rising 82% from 2012 to 2015 to the highest demand on record, 292M oz.

Yet despite the variability, the trend is clear over the last decade: silver is being demanded increasingly as an investment store of value.

<strong>Speculation as the Art of Profit</strong>

Speculation is the nature of all investment. To make a profit as investors, we must have a belief that is above and beyond what is currently accepted by the mainstream. We must view more perspective, or know more information, than the sum of the other market participants in order for there to be a discrepancy in prices. It is only in discrepancy between current prices and future prices there is the potential for gain.

So let us speculate for a moment.

Why is silver seeing this recent increase in investment demand? Why are there six times as many investment dollars buying <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/bars">silver bars</a> and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/coins">coins</a> now compared to a decade ago?

Our analysis is that silver is regaining some of its historic monetary role. Indeed, for most of the history of human civilization, while gold has traditionally served as a store of wealth, silver has been used for smaller monetary exchanges. To this day in Spanish, the word for silver is the same as the word for money ('plata'). It is only since 1965, when the last U.S. quarters and dimes containing <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/junk-silver">90% silver</a> were removed from circulation, that silver has not had a direct monetary role. We thus exist in what can be viewed as a 50-year 'experiment' in human history with silver not serving as money.

As a society, have we progressed for the first time to such an advanced level that silver is permanently relegated to a relic of monetary history? Or, does human nature move in repeating cycles, with silver beginning to reemerge as a store of value after several decades out of favor?

We turn to the market for answers. Judging from the increase in investment demand, we can see that the metal is regaining something of a monetary premium. And while the growth over the last decade is impressive, it still amounts to only 292M oz. purchased worldwide every year.

<strong>What is the Potential for Investment Demand?</strong>

To put the size of the worldwide investable silver market into perspective, 292M oz. purchased per year equates to roughly $5.8 billion.

The market cap of Apple Computer alone is over $550 billion.

Let us ask a few reasonable questions:
<ol>
 	<li>What would happen if each of the 100M households in the United States wanted to own 10 ounces of silver next year ($200 per household)? Such would equate to one billion ounces of silver demand.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
 	<li>With jewelry/silverware/industrial use consuming over 80% of the one billion ounce supply at any price, where would that silver come from?</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Moreover, what if one billion of the world's 7.3 billion residents each wanted to own a single ounce per year for the next three years?</li>
</ol>
The silver is simply not there at current prices. A major revaluation would have to occur should any additional significant demand come into the market.

Turning our attention to the long-term <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver chart</a>, note the increasing price spikes every few years (2006, 2008, 2011) with a rising linear up trend line (shown in magenta) acting as support.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-527" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/silver-price-1980-present.png" alt="silver-price-1980-present" width="1240" height="737" />

Amidst a rising mine supply and stable industrial/jewelry/silverware demand, it <em>must be the physical investment</em> demand that has caused these price spikes, as every few years a new wave of investors moves into the silver market.

<strong>Silver Price Projections</strong>

Our analysis is that silver has formed a long-term bottom in the $13 - $16 price range.

From this bottom, the trend is clear: silver is regaining a monetary/investment premium after several decades of mostly fabrication use. That fabrication demand is inelastic. The investment demand for silver is what exists at the margin, and has been the primary driver in higher silver price spikes seen over the last decade. Economic cycles tend to move in waves over time, and when a small percentage of the world's population decides to invest only a tiny fraction of its combined wealth into silver, we anticipate the price will rise to a multiple of the current level.

Our initial 3-5 year target is a retest of $50/oz. This has been a multi-decade resistance level. Once this level is broken decisively, we anticipate it will act like a floor, just as the $850 level has for gold and the $1.20 level has for copper. From there, we may reevaluate our thesis as fundamental factors warrant.

For those investors with at least a several-year time horizon and a tolerance for high volatility, the opportunity in silver looks quite significant -- from a technical and a fundamental viewpoint.

Silver to gold ratio used to be about 20 to 1 when Nixon unmanned the purchase of gold. With China not allowing one gram of gold to be exported and India and China encouraging there citizens to buy and accumulate precious metals that's almost 2.6 billion of the world'series population. Stories about industrial users paying well over spot and companys paying whatever over spot to keep their own doors open, the short squeeze is on.  Good luck to you and yours.

		<title>Analysis: Gold to Dow Ratio</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/07/25/gold-to-dow-ratio/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The US stock market hit a new all-time high this week as fears that the Brexit fallout would spill across the Atlantic subsided somewhat. Given the strength seen in the world's largest equity market, and that we are now directly within the seasonally-weakest time period of the year for the precious metals, it is not unexpected to see some funds shift out of <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold </a>and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> and into US stocks.

Below we show the US Dow Jones Industrial Average, from the crash lows of 2009 through the present. Note how prices have just this week spiked above the 18500 level, the previous high from 2015.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-582" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/US-Dow-Jones-Industrial-Average-2009-2016.png" alt="US-Dow-Jones-Industrial-Average-2009-2016" width="1240" height="928" />

Yet generally, the proper strategy to make a solid return in the markets is not to follow the crowd and chase the best-performing assets of the last several years. Rather, the best strategy is typically to take the contrarian perspective and to try to find out what most people are ignoring.

We must remember that the chart above shows US stocks <u>priced in US dollars.</u>

As we know, the US dollar is a depreciating currency (as are all world currencies). So in the chart above we are not looking at a stable-value measure for the Dow.

It would thus be beneficial to also see the Dow as compared to another form of money: gold.

Below we show the value of the Dow compared to gold since 1980. This ratio asks: how many shares of the Dow Jones Industrial Average does it take to buy one ounce of gold?

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-583" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Dow-to-gold-ratio.png" alt="Dow-to-gold-ratio" width="1240" height="737" />

Currently it takes 0.070 shares of the Dow to buy one ounce of gold.

The all-time low value for gold relative to the Dow was set in the year 1999 when it took only 0.024 shares of the Dow to buy the same ounce.

In contrast, the all-time high for the ratio was set in 1980 at 1.00. This was at the last generational precious metals peak when, for a short period, the price of gold topped $850 per ounce and the Dow was also priced at 850.

With this historical perspective, what can we say about the current price of gold?

<strong>Gold is nowhere near a long-term peak.</strong>

In fact, gold is priced much closer to its 1999 bottom than its 1980 peak as measured against the Dow.

For example, if the ratio was to hit 1.00 again, and the Dow was to simply maintain its current value, gold would have to be re-priced to $18,500 per ounce.

Should the Dow lose half it's value and fall to 9250, gold would still need to rise 7-fold to reach this same number.

Both of these examples would feature a nominal return to the 1.00 ratio between gold and the Dow as seen in 1980.

<strong>Ratios Repeat Throughout History</strong>

Further, the 1980 peak was not the only time in history that this ratio hit 1.00.

In 1933, when gold was confiscated from American citizens by President Roosevelt and revalued during the Great Depression from $20 to $35 per ounce, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen from its peak of 400 all the way to the upper 30's.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-597" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/djia.png" alt="Dow-Jones-Average-1933-crash_" width="575" height="443" />

The gold to Dow ratio in the early 1930's thus stood at nearly 1.00.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-585" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/d_Gold_conf.jpeg" alt="Dow -ratio-1933" width="1128" height="736" />

We therefore have multiple data points throughout history of precious metals peaks in which the Dow and gold were valued the same in nominal terms. Currently at 18,500 and $1,315 respectively, clearly we are not in the territory of a long-term top in gold.

It will be important over the coming months to keep the Gold-Dow ratio in mind if we see some continued consolidation in the precious metals, and further advances in US stocks. The mainstream media will likely be fully endorsing the move higher in stocks (after all, most media conglomerates are public companies whose shares are included in the stock indices -- they thus have much to gain by encouraging individuals to bid their shares higher).

Yet those with a little historic perspective will let these moves unfold as they surely must. Even at $1,315, gold is priced closer to a bottom than a top compared to major stock markets. The reversion to a historic valuation ratio that has occurred multiple times in the past will occur again. Those who understand this phenomenon of reversion to the mean will continue to quietly accumulate gold and related assets even as the mainstream financial press focuses on the nominal new highs being made in the US stock market.

		<title>Gold Surges After Fed Meeting</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/08/01/gold-surges-fed-meeting/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The primary driver for the precious metals last week was the Federal Reserve meeting, which concluded on Wednesday. At the meeting, the Fed once again left interest rates unchanged, at generationally-low levels targeting 0.25% - 0.50%.

Even more important than the lack of change in the target rate was the Fed's statement regarding inflation following the decision:

<em>"</em><em>Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months. "</em>

In essence, when the Fed comments that inflation expectations are low, it is signaling that it intends to spark more inflation (i.e. print more money). Gold and silver, being inflation-sensitive assets, deciphered this language and spiked immediately following the Fed announcement, with <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold rising</a> $20 for the day and silver nearly $0.70.

<strong>Fed Policy is Currency Debasement</strong>

It is important to step back for a moment and contemplate some of the policies described in the Fed's meeting statement above. Here we have a central bank explicitly stating that its policy is to debase the currency by 2 percent per year.

<strong>Two percent inflation per year, compounded, results in the currency losing 50% of its value in just 34 years.</strong>

Thus, the Fed's policy is to have savers in US dollars lose 50% of their wealth every generation.

How is it possible that citizens accept such a policy for the international reserve currency?

Our long-term thesis is that, slowly but surely, more individuals will begin to wake up the problems inherent with this official inflation policy. When citizens begin to understand this system, at least some will turn to precious metals as a form of protection. If even a small fraction of the world's population makes this decision, the metals will be forced to revalue upward significantly in the coming years.

Our charts are the maps showing these revaluations as they are occurring in real-time.

<strong>Technical Analysis on Gold</strong>

Gold is now making its second attempt at breaking out from the final long-term downtrend that has held its price in check since 2011. While it is not yet certain that this important technical level will be breached this week, we have some important early-indicator signals coming from related sectors that the expected move is not far off into the future.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-604" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Gold-price-2009-present.png" alt="Gold-price-2009-present" width="1240" height="928" />

The first attempt at breaking the long-term magenta-colored downtrend was made one month ago at $1,380, and now, as the trend inherently slopes downward, this second attempt is being seen at a slightly lower price level, near $1,365. (To be safe, we should extend this resistance zone upward to the psychologically-important $1,400 level.)

Let us zoom the above chart in to the 18-month timeframe for a closer examination:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-605" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/gold-price-2015-2016.png" alt="gold-price-2015-2016" width="1240" height="928" />

To those unfamiliar with technical analysis, the surges and retracements seen in gold recently may appear unpredictable, but with the proper technical lens, we can clearly see where large buyers and sellers are emerging.

Let us not mince words: gold is caught in the crosshairs of a significant technical battle at this exact moment. Support was seen this week after the Fed meeting where we expected, right above the green zone labeled near $1,310. Such was the second time gold has bounced at this level, increasing the validity of the support.

Note that the green support zone and the long-term downtrend are converging into the September - October timeframe. When two technical levels converge, one must necessarily give way to the other.

Moreover, gold is also firmly within the rising royal-blue parallel channel which began at the December 2015 bottom. The lower line from this pattern is rising and will also be meeting with the aforementioned two levels by mid-September.

There are thus at minimum three important technical trends that traders and investors alike are monitoring.

<strong>Clues from the Gold Mining Sector</strong>

Subtle clues are appearing that the converging patterns will result in a breakout for gold.

Below we take a quick side by side comparison of the gold miners (top) versus gold itself (bottom) for the last three months. Note that the gold miners are once again on the verge of breaking through their July highs, whereas gold bullion is still some $20 below its corresponding high.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-606" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/gold-miners-2016.png" alt="gold -miners-2016" width="460" height="667" />

The gold miners are leading the metal since the initial bottom observed last December, and are now giving us a signal that gold itself is setting up for a move higher this fall.

<strong>Long Term Ramifications for a Pending Gold Breakout</strong>

We have made the case in past work that the pending break of this 5-year downtrend in gold will set the sector up for an even more powerful scenario from a multi-decade perspective.

Similar to falling dominos, one pattern's completion triggers another to begin, the completion of which may then trigger additional patterns into the future.

Below is the 36-year perspective for gold in logarithmic format, noting the 5-year gently sloping decline that has taken the distinct shape of a "bull flag" formation. Superimposed onto this image is the textbook definition for this bull flag pattern, for reference.

It is the break of the previously-mentioned 2011-2015 downtrend that will set up the bull flag pattern to initiate.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-607" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/gold-spot-price-2011-2015.png" alt="gold-spot-price-2011-2015" width="1240" height="546" />

Bull flag formations represent a pause in an ongoing bull market. In this case, the 2001-2011 advance is seen as the initial "flag pole" surge, the 2011-2015 decline is seen as the half-way "flag" pause, and what is coming should be an advance roughly equivalent to the initial amplitude of the "flag pole".

The initial surge in gold's case measured $1,650 (the amplitude from 2001-2011), and we derive a target for the bull flag pattern by adding this figure to the most recent low of approximately $1,050.

In summary, when we witness a break of the $1,400 resistance zone, there results a strong probability that gold will see a long-term target of at least $2,700.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Gold Technical Update</strong>

Gold has just made its second attempt within the last five weeks at breaking through its long-term downtrend (see long-term charts on the previous article, available <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/08/01/gold-surges-fed-meeting">here</a>), and this opportunity once again proved unsuccessful. This price action increases the validity of the resistance shown by the trend line and its importance as a technical data point. Gold is going to have to prove it can overcome this level for the next leg of the bull market to commence.

Yet despite this short-term weakness, we have several reasons to believe that a breakout will be arriving shortly, and those reasons are presented herein.

Gold rose as high as $1,367 early in the week, but sellers continue to appear just above this level and the price backed off to close at $1,335 on the spot market by Friday afternoon.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-622" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Gold-rose-on-friday.png" alt="Gold-rose-on-friday" width="1240" height="928" />

As is typical, charts can often tell us "what" is setting up in the gold market, but the "why" component usually remains to be seen. So what was the cause of gold's fall on Friday? In this case, the drop was due to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) which released a "seasonally-adjusted" jobs report for July showing 255,000 jobs created for the month in the United States.

The term "seasonally-adjusted" means the number was not actually derived from a survey of employers proper, but rather estimated based on a seasonal algorithm that the BLS uses for assumed job creation, resulting from historic seasonal trends.

Interestingly, 2016 has seen the highest assumed seasonal job growth reported by the BLS in the last 10 years, as can be seen below:

<img class="alignnone wp-image-623" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/BLS-seasonal-job-growth-reported.jpg" alt="BLS-seasonal-job growth-reported" width="600" height="260" />

Exactly how they derive this assumed data is a question on many analysts' minds, but regardless of the validity of the figure, the market interpreted the announcement to be largely positive for the US dollar and the US stock market, which both spiked higher. As a result, both gold and silver were sold off.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-624" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/c_Aug5.png" alt="c_Aug5" width="972" height="648" />

We now return to the charts to guide us as to what may happen next for gold and the precious metals.

<strong>Gold is "Coiling Up"</strong>

Refer again to the first primary chart of gold at the beginning of this article. Gold is now "coiling up" between strong resistance below the previously-mentioned downtrend, and the strong support which is appearing between $1,285 and $1,306, as shown by the green band. This is labeled "Converging Patterns" on the chart.

Of course, this support zone was the former resistance zone we had been following for nearly 18 months, which, decisively broken in June, is now seeing second-chance buyers step in each time the price retreats to this zone.

When markets coil up in this manner, like a spring being held down -- eventually when released the market will experience a significant move in one direction or another.

In studying the area on the primary <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold chart</a> above representing the convergence of the downtrend resistance and the green support zone, we note that the meeting of these two trends does not necessarily have to happen until after January 2017. Technically speaking then, the market could take through the winter to break higher or lower from the convergence of these patterns.

However, in years of studying these charts, we can say that in the majority of cases the convergence will resolve itself in one direction or another before the actual meeting of the trends.

Further, based on 45 years of available data since <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> has traded free from the US dollar standard, the single strongest month of the year for gold is straight ahead: September.

We thus have a high expectation that the breaking of these converging trend patterns is going to take place within the next 4-8 weeks.

<strong>Gold Miners Still Providing Leadership Clues</strong>

The gold miners are still anticipating this breakout in the metal, as shown below by the quick reference between the HUI gold miners index on top and spot gold below.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-625" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/d_HUI_Gold.png" alt="gold-miners-anticipating-breakout -aug-2016" width="398" height="585" />

Note that the large cap miners closed the week with a marginal gain, whereas the metal finished lower by Friday. The miners indeed finished at a new 52-week closing weekly high.

This outperformance, subtle though it may seem, is continuing to give us clues regarding the resolution of the metal's converging trend patterns.

<strong>Takeaway on Gold Prices</strong>

Strong support exists between $1,285 and $1,306, while resistance is being seen above $1,365. These price levels are converging on the yearly charts, and when opposing trends converge one or the other must break. At present the seasonal strong period for precious metals is due ahead, and we observe leadership in the gold mining equities. We see a high probability of a <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> breakout within the next 4-8 weeks, with an advance to target $1,450.

		<title>Gold&#039;s Advance a Worldwide Phenomenon</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are continuing to see more evidence that the advance that is ahead of us across the precious metals complex will be a worldwide phenomenon, and not a US dollar-primary event as was seen in the bull market of the 1970's.

<img class="wp-image-646 alignleft" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/a_UKInterest.png" alt="UK-Interest-rate" width="480" height="588" />

This week the Bank of England, clearly responding to the continued tumultuous market conditions since the June 24 Brexit decision, voted to lower short-term interest rates for the first time since 2009. This brings the key lending rate to 0.25%, an all-time record low.

We thus have record low interest rates in the United States, in Europe, and now in England.

Recall that in order for central banks to force interest rates to record lows, they must do so by buying the entire short-end of the bond curve in that country. The money they use to buy those bonds is printed out of thin air, or rather created with the digital equivalent thereof.

Not only does this money creation directly devalue the currency in question, but by holding the short-end of the yield curve down, it forces investors to withdraw funds from low-yield savings accounts or short-term certificates of deposit.

Instead, investors desiring yield are funneled into riskier assets to try to achieve any sort of reasonable income from their capital.

It is any wonder then that the London FTSE 100 stock index is approaching all-time highs? Or that British 10-year government bond yields are approaching all-time lows -- which means their prices are also at all-time highs?

<strong>London FTSE 100 Index since crash of 2008</strong><img class="wp-image-633 size-large aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/b-London-FTSE-100-Index-since-crash-of-2008-819x1024.png" alt="b-London-FTSE 100-Index-since crash-of-2008" width="819" height="1024" />

&nbsp;

<strong>UK Government 10-year Bond Yields</strong>

<img class="wp-image-635 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/c-UK-Government-10-year-Bond-Yields.png" alt="UK-Government-10-year-Bond-Yields" width="779" height="699" />

&nbsp;
<h2>Money "sloshing around" the system</h2>
All this freshly-created central bank money is now "sloshing around" the financial and political system, bidding up stock prices, bidding up bonds, bidding up mortgages, funding endless unwinnable wars...

The world has seen several stock-market bubbles over the last 100 years, but has never seen a bond bubble in the way we are now witnessing.

Furthermore, when we study the past we see examples of when certain individual countries have gone down the path of excess money-printing, but we have no examples of a time in which the entire world was engaged in the practice simultaneously.

We are living in an unprecedented time in world history.

What we can conclude based on a study of past asset bubble deflations is that precious metals -- the only store of wealth that politicians or central bankers cannot debase -- will in some way fit into the solution when the bubbles eventually burst.

It is important for us as investors who sometimes focus on the shorter-term patterns setting up in the metals to not lose sight of the unprecedented bigger picture that is developing.

When only a fraction of stock or bond investors, markets which are much larger in total dollar value than <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> combined, decide to move only a fraction of their combined wealth into the precious metals, the upward revaluation will be beyond anything we have witnessed thus far.

It is likely that the 30% <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">surge in gold</a> and the 45% <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">surge in silver</a> seen in the last six months represent those early to jump ship from the aforementioned bubble markets and to move some of their capital into the historic metallic stores of wealth. Yet as we see the bubbles still continuing to inflate, we can deduce that we have not yet seen the critical mass begin to move into gold and silver in a meaningful way.
<h2>Update - Gold in Australian Dollars</h2>
We continue to monitor gold as priced in Australian dollars (AUD) as a leading indicator for gold in other major world currencies.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-636" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/d-Gold-in-Australian-dollar.png" alt="Gold-in-Australian-dollar" width="1240" height="737" />

The all-time high for gold in AUD was in 2011 at just over $1,850 per ounce. Gold in AUD closed this week at $1,756, less than 6% away from the all-time high.

We have seen 6% surges in gold in one week in the past, so a retest of this level is possible at any time.

When gold decisively breaks to a new all-time high in AUD, it will serve as a signal to the rest of the world that such advances are in store for other major currencies. What was once viewed as a USD-only phenomenon is starting to be recognized in no uncertain terms as worldwide trend in rising gold demand.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In technical analysis we place a greater emphasis on long-term trendlines for good reason.

For over seven weeks now <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> has continued to bump against its final 2011-2016 downtrend, which has held prices lower since the 2011 high of $1,923 per ounce. Every time it attempts to break higher above this down-sloping resistance level, sellers immediately show up to drive the price back down.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-663" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/a-Gold-2009-present.png" alt="Gold-2009-present" width="1240" height="928" />

There is clearly a battle going on at this exact moment between bulls and bears. Bears know that if this long-term technical resistance level is broken, it will send a signal to the many investors waiting on the sidelines that the time has arrived to jump back into precious metals market. And when an influx of new technical buyers all enter at once -- a surge in price is going to result. The bears are therefore defending this exact technical level we are monitoring. The tightness of the battle is now evident down to the intraday level, where we have observed sellers appearing above $1,355 per ounce and buyers appearing in the $1,330 region over the last week.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-664" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/b_Gold-1year-forecast.png" alt="Gold-1year-forecast" width="1240" height="928" />

What the tightness of this consolidation means is that the market is nearing a resolution. Typically the break of a significant long-term trend line in gold will result in a quick $50 - $100 movement in price. Following that initial break, a retracement toward the trend line will generally occur. The degree to which gold fully or only partially comes back to retest its broken trend line will give us clues as to the strength of the subsequent advance.

Of course, let us not get ahead of ourselves: the technical breakout has not yet occurred. For the week, gold finished higher marginally by $3.00 to close at $1,346.20, for a modest 0.2% gain from a week prior.

<strong>Seasonal Indian Demand Ahead</strong>

Despite the continued consolidation, sellers will have to be quite determined if they are to continue holding back the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">price of gold</a> once demand begins to emerge within the next month from India. It is during this late August through September period when increased physical demand is seen year after year prior to the Indian wedding season, which begins in October.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-665" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/c-gold-demand-country.png" alt="gold-demand-country" width="764" height="726" />

Let us not overlook: Indian demand is critically significant in the physical market. As shown above, India consumes more gold per year than any other country outside China, and more than the United States and Europe combined. And the majority of this demand occurs in the period prior to the October wedding season.

As precious metals investors, we are thus biding our time in waiting mode to monitor the strength of the coming seasonal demand.

&nbsp;

<strong>Silver Update</strong><strong> </strong>

Silver is currently within a midpoint consolidation pattern, with well-defined resistance appearing on the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">charts</a> between $20.60 - $20.70. Minor support has appeared over the last seven weeks near $19.20; however, stronger long-term support appears between the $17.50 - $18.50 price zone.

Silver's consolidation is part of a series of imbedded patterns which have appeared since the bottom was confirmed in December 2015 at $13.65 per ounce.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-666" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/d-Silver-2013-16.png" alt="Silver-2013-16" width="1240" height="1119" />

Silver's actual bottom took the shape of a bottoming wedge formation, shown in the chart above in turquoise color, indicating broken trend lines. The bottoming wedge is a pattern in which both highs and lows are falling, yet highs are falling at a steeper rate than the subsequent lows. This pattern indicates that buyers are stepping in at relatively higher levels on each decline. The pattern tends to represent a terminal bottom formation, in which buyers eventually overcome sellers and a trend reversal is seen. Silver broke out of the formation in February 2016 and confirmed the December bottom, shown by the red highlight circle above.<strong> </strong>

Remember that these formations merely show us the levels at which large buyers and sellers are entering the market, and the patterns which are defining their behavior. If we study the behavior of large investors and align ourselves with them, we stand to time our entry and exit points better and to potentially achieve a greater profit.

Since the bottom, silver has formed a series of imbedded head and shoulder patterns, the first level of which took place below $16.00, shown in royal blue above.

After breaking higher from $16.00 in April, this pattern targeted $18.25, which was hit in June.

Since achieving its level 1 target, silver now finds itself in the midst of a second-level head and shoulders pattern, which is shown above in the magenta color. The price target for this pattern is between $21.50 - $23.00, and this target is yet to be achieved. $21.50 - $23.00 thus remains our open target for silver's next advance.

Note that silver has a tendency to overshoot technical patterns, as it is a small market and is prone to extreme swings in either direction. We thus maintain the possibility that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> may overshoot its next target and reach $25 within the next several months, which is an area of strong resistance dating back to 2012.

It is expected that silver will begin this next advance concurrently to gold's breaking of its long-term downtrend, referenced in the gold analysis above.

		<title>Markets at Crossroads</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Several interrelated markets are simultaneously at important crossroads, so we want to be aware and prepared for the possibilities that may soon materialize. The (northern hemisphere) summer months tend to be the slowest time of the year not just for precious metals, but for many of the capital markets. There is an old saying: “Sell in May and go away.” Certain years this is more useful advice than others, but the point is that we are nearing the end of what has essentially been range-bound action across the precious metals, stock markets, and currency markets since late spring, even with the dramatic events associated with Brexit in June. One way or another, it appears likely that market action is going to start getting more “interesting” after the end of the summer season, which culminates unofficially on the Labor Day holiday in the US next Monday, September 5.

&nbsp;

<strong>US Stock Market</strong>

The US stock market continues to meander higher, defying most recent analysts’ attempts to pinpoint a top. We remain a somewhat detached observer of the action in broad US stocks, as we hold no investments in them directly. However, all markets are somewhat interrelated, and as precious metals and stocks can sometimes be counter-cyclical, we are, by owning precious metals, by default “short” such other markets.

Taking the long-term view of the US Dow Jones Industrial Average, the most likely scenario we see is that the market is forming a generational-timeframe “expanding megaphone” top. The expanding megaphone is a topping pattern with several successive highs and successive lows, each high being above the previous high, and each low being below the previous low. It takes the shape of an expanding outward cone or megaphone. The pattern shows a bifurcated market experiencing extreme swings in psychology every several years, a scenario which usually does not end with a positive resolution.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-685" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/a-stocks-dow-1980-present.png" alt="stocks-dow -1980-present" width="1240" height="928" />

We have had three hits along the upper trend line of this pattern since the year 2000, and two hits on the lower trend. Consequently, the pattern calls for a drop in the Dow down to the lower trend line at minimum, for a third hit, at some point over the next 3-5 years. Based on the projection, this would equate roughly Dow 5,000.

Long-term patterns such as this are certainly not appropriate for immediate trading, and indeed as we have seen potential tops can take much longer to materialize than most anticipate. It is quite possible for the stock market to continue grinding higher for another year or two as part of this formation.

However, the level of complacency seen in the market now is certainly at levels ripe for a top to form. Most employees are blissfully happy to continue contributing to stock 401(k) retirement funds, secure in the knowledge of slow and steady annual gains.

History shows that such psychological complacency is typically a precursor to significant market corrections.

&nbsp;

<strong>US Bond Market</strong>

In generations past, bonds and stocks were considered opposite ends of the investment spectrum. Stocks were seen as vehicles for growth and appreciation, and bonds were seen as investments for safety. As such, during times when stocks fell, funds often moved into bonds. And during times when stocks were appreciating, money conversely moved out of bonds.

With the advent of unprecedented money-printing by the Fed after the 2008 financial crisis, all of that changed. For the first time in the modern era, since 2008 we have seen both stock and bonds rising in near unison. Keep in mind the above graph of the Dow – which is at an all-time high -- when we look at the following graph of US 30-year bond prices over the same time period:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-686" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/b-us-bonds-1980-present.png" alt="us-bonds-1980-present" width="1240" height="737" />

As we can see, US 30-year bond prices are also at all-time highs, which is what has forced their yields to all-time lows.

This is the first occasion in modern US history when both stock and bond prices are simultaneously at all-time highs. When we say we are living through an unprecedented time, we mean it literally.

How is it possible that so much money is flowing both into stocks (growth assets) and bonds (safety assets) at the same time?

The answer is simple. The Fed has printed so much money over the last eight years, that it is searching for a home somewhere… anywhere. Fundamentals have been pushed aside, and money is flowing wherever it can in search of some type of return.

The Fed has turned on a fire hose in an attempt to fill a bathtub. While the tub is certainly getting filled, so is the rest of the bathroom, the living room, and the downstairs apartment, for that matter.

The only question that remains is where is all this money going to flow when these trends reverse, and we see what may be for the first time in history falling stock and bond prices simultaneously?

It is estimated that the size of the global bond market is roughly $100 trillion, while the size of the global equity markets are nearly $70 trillion. Meanwhile, the dollar amount of all the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold </a>ever mined in the history of the world is close to $8 trillion, but less than half of that is available for investment (the rest is held as jewelry and industrial fabrication).

What is setting up when even a small portion of the $170 trillion in combined bond + equity markets attempts to start exiting those assets and to find a home in precious metals will make the moves we have witnessed thus far look like a mere warmup.

Stay tuned… the bubble behavior in bonds and stocks has not culminated yet… but Stein’s Law says: “That which cannot continue forever will one day stop.” And that day is drawing closer.

&nbsp;

<strong>Gold Analysis</strong>

Despite the $20 or 1.5% drop seen in gold this week and the whipsawing that occurred on Friday after Yellen’s comments, the situation in the world’s monetary element remains largely unchanged from a technical standpoint.

On the near-term <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">chart gold</a> is still awaiting a resolution of the convergence of the multiple trend lines we have been monitoring since June. Resistance continues to appear every time gold approaches $1,355 - $1,378, while support is emerging above the $1,285 - $1,306 zone labeled in green. Gold’s primary blue rising channel remains in play until proven otherwise, and one or more of these trends will be forced to break within the next 6 weeks.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-687" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/c-gold-2015-2017-forecast.png" alt="-gold-2015-2017-forecast" width="1240" height="928" />

The action on Friday, although disappointing to watch throughout the day, was not altogether bad from a technical perspective. Below we are zooming the above chart in to the 1-month perspective to analyze the Japanese candlesticks -- each representing one day’s price action:

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-688" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/d-candlesticks.png" alt="candlesticks" width="131" height="196" />

The pattern seen on Friday is called a gravestone doji in Japanese candlestick analysis, because it looks like a gravestone with a long upper shadow. Context is critical for evaluation of these candlesticks. When gravestone dojis occur after a strong advance, they can be a sign of a top, as the price rises above a specific price level but then falls back below it later in the day.

Yet when gravestone dojis occur near an area of support, they typically indicate budding strength to come. In this case, we can see a very similar doji that appeared three weeks prior, circled in red. Note that the day represented a local support, after which prices rose over the next week.

Gravestone dojis do not always represent exact bottoms, but they do show us that there are buyers lurking in the background. The pattern should be considered a warning to the bears that they are losing their grip on the recent decline.

If a short-term bottom indeed emerges here after this gravestone doji, we will be looking for another attempt at gold breaking its long-term (magenta) downtrend within the next 1-2 weeks.

		<title>G20 Meeting to Start a Busy Month in Currency Markets</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday, Monday, September 5 is Labor Day here in the United States. As such, US markets were closed. Trading has occurred in <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> on other world exchanges... yet as the volume of contracts traded is still mostly dominated by the New York COMEX, we were hesitant to expect any significant moves until Tuesday.

We recently reviewed the first-half 2016 statistics for gold. The international store of wealth had its best first-half in over 30 years -- on a percentage basis up 26%. It is easy to overlook that statistic amidst the consolidation we have seen since June.

Yet that number is telling us something. Tensions must be brewing in the world financial system for gold to rise so significantly in such a short time. For the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">price</a> to rise $300 in six months, large entities were purchasing hundreds of tonnes of metal for weeks on end. We cannot be certain for what reasons they were acting -- those reasons will reveal themselves in time -- but there are four important events coming up over the next 6 weeks that could all have significant impacts on the currency and precious metals markets. They are:

<strong>September 5</strong> - the G20 countries conclude their meeting in Hangzhou, China.

<strong>September 21</strong> - the US Federal Reserve releases its decision on interest rates.

<strong>September 30</strong> - the Chinese yuan is formally included in the SDR reserve system. (The SDR or Special Drawing Right is an International Monetary Fund (IMF) basket of currencies that is increasingly being used instead of the US dollar for loans or aid to recipient nations.)

<strong>October 7</strong> - the IMF conducts its annual meeting in Washington, D.C.

One way or another, it appears that the season set to begin on Tuesday will not feature the same range-bound action that we have witnessed for the last 10 weeks. Things are going to get more volatile, more exciting. We expect these trends to move upward for gold and silver, but if anything changes on that outlook we will be writing about it here.

<u> </u>

<strong><u>US Dollar</u></strong>

On the topic of the currency markets, let us take a look at the action in the US Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of foreign currencies including the Euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Swedish krona, and the Swiss franc. Despite the surge in the US dollar on the June 24 Brexit vote, the chart of the world’s reserve currency is increasingly looking fragile.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-708" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/a-USD-Index.png" alt="USD-Index" width="1240" height="737" />

&nbsp;

The dollar has been consolidating for nearly 20 months. Resistance is well-defined between 99-100 on the Index.  Meanwhile, each successive move into the support zone near 93 has shown technical "cracks". First in August 2015, we note the low in the Dollar Index broke briefly lower to 92, and then in May 2015 the low broke further again to 91.5. These technical cracks in the form of lower lows are alerting us that buyers are not as determined to support the dollar at this juncture as some might assume.

Currently, the dollar finds itself perched precariously just above a short-term support line at 94. A break below 94 and the dollar will be retesting recent lows near 91-92 in short order. Based on the technical weakness observed over the last year, it is likely that if such a retest does occur, it will fail, and the dollar will be heading to new multi-year lows.

This would be positive for the precious metals. While over the long run <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> will be moving higher regardless of the currency denomination, over the short run we should expect to see a more significant move if the US dollar begins to falter.

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Gold Update</u></strong>

Below is the updated 18-month chart for gold. For 10-weeks now gold has been stuck in a consolidation of just 5.5%, between $1,303 and $1,378. Big buyers have bought... big sellers have sold... and now most market participants are waiting -- to see who shows up next. Because after a period of low volatility, the next arrival of a new group of buyers or sellers will determine the market trend for the intermediate future.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The advances seen on Friday in both gold and silver were related to the release of US employment data, which missed analyst estimates. Payrolls were reported at 151,000 additions in August, which was lower than the median forecast of 180,000. The US dollar fell on the news, as the chance of a Federal Reserve rate hike at the upcoming September meeting was dimmed. Conversely, gold and silver both rose.

For the week, gold finished with a nominal gain of $0.80, to close at $1,326 as of the NY COMEX close.

Notably, gold bounced right at the upper region of our green support band shown above, at $1,303 on Thursday.

We continue to watch for a break above the declining magenta-colored long-term downtrend for a signal that the next stage of the bull market will soon begin.

		<title>Bond Jitters and Precious Metals Updates</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/09/12/bond-jitters-precious-metals-updates/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2016 15:38:30 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Coming into September, and especially with the drop in stocks on Friday, there is a lot of fear about what will happen over the next few weeks in the markets.

There seems to be a general sense of unease that develops during September and October, likely due to the high confluence of market crashes that have occurred during this time. The stock market crash of 1929 began in October of that year. The crash of 1987 occurred in October as well. And the financial crisis of 2008 intensified rapidly during September and October.

Perhaps there is something ingrained in our seasonal cycle as human beings that leads us to grow cautious as the days become shorter and the temperatures get colder (in the northern hemisphere)... and somehow this innate worry translates into a high correlation with stock market panics over the last 100 years.

Friday saw a strong down day in US stocks, as it appears the summer lull has ended for the markets. The S&amp;P 500 Index of US companies fell nearly 2.4% for the day, the largest percentage drop since the day of the Brexit vote in June.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-733" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/a_Friday-SP-500-Index-US-companies.png" alt="Friday-S&amp;P-500-Index-US-companies" width="1002" height="670" />

&nbsp;

Yet the interesting point is that US 20-year bonds -- which throughout most of history would see safe-haven buying on a strong down day in stocks -- fell on Friday as well. This is most unusual, and merits close monitoring over the months to come, as it is a fundamental component of our long-term thesis for ownership of <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/how-to/gold-vs-silver-vs-platinum-vs-palladium">precious metals</a>. That is: if both stocks and bonds were to fall for the first time in unison over the years to come -- gold would emerge as a final safety asset.

Indeed, although gold was down on Friday by 0.6%, it performed well on a relative basis when compared to bonds, which were down 1.6%.

Relative strength is an indicator we use quite frequently, as it shows certain investors stepping in to buy one asset, even as most other assets are being sold. This is especially important when comparing typical "safety" assets. While one-day of price action is not enough to call this a trend, in prior articles we have discussed why we are on alert for what will eventually be a 35+ year top in long bonds at some point before the close of the decade.

Where will the world turn for safety when US bonds, the asset known to fulfill this role for over a generation, loses its status as such?

A long-term decline in bonds coinciding with a long-term decline in stocks would be something never witnessed in modern history... but all signs indicate that it is exactly the scenario which is now brewing. Of course, bubbles are notorious for taking longer to pop than most people expect -- and thus there still may be one more final "blow-off" phase in US bond prices that perhaps could see yields go fully negative (as they have in other countries). But "the writing is on the wall" for what is coming, and it is going to be a fascinating time not only to be an investor, but generally to be a citizen of this world.

<strong>Gold Update</strong>

Gold saw nothing less than its fourth attempt this week to overcome the long-term resistance that we have been monitoring for the better part of the last three months, the price level for which currently comes in near $1,360. The price spiked up to $1,356 on Monday and Tuesday, and then once again sellers showed up during the remainder of the week to drive the price back down toward $1,330. This consolidation between $1,300 and the downtrend line referenced in the magenta color has been ongoing for 11-weeks now, and it is nearing a resolution.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-734" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/b_Gold1Y.png" alt="Gold-1year-forecast" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

The reason we are paying so much attention to the pending break of this long-term trendline is that it is going to represent the shifting in psychology from bear to bull market for the final group of investors who are still clinging to the possibility that gold will be making a new low, below the December 2015 bottom at $1,045.

The price action that we witness after these converging sets of trend lines resolve should not resemble what has happened over the last several months. A stronger trending move should occur, which will result in a new wave of investors becoming interested in the sector.

Although it appears on the chart above that the converging consolidation could last through February 2017, in studying these types of patterns in the past we can say that they generally do not last beyond the 2/3 timeframe mark. The pattern is currently nearing the half-way mark, and we feel a break is imminent at any time now. It would take a drop in gold below the bottom level of the green support zone -- $1,285 -- to make us question the likelihood for the anticipated advance to come this fall.

For now, we continue to see buyers step into the gold market each time the price approaches $1,300.

&nbsp;

<strong>Silver Update</strong>

After making another attempt to overcome the key psychological $20 figure, silver fell back starting on Wednesday and finished flat for the week, closing just above $19.

Of note is the weakness that silver saw on Friday relative to gold, falling 2.8% to gold's 0.6% by the close of the day. This phenomenon is common on days when the stock market is seeing a strong sell-off and gold is falling even modestly. In such instances silver tends to multiply the losses in the two markets, seeing selling both from the precious metals sector and also from the industrial sector.

In a steady stock market with rising <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold prices</a>, it is often the case that silver will amplify the gains in <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> as it benefits from both sectors.

This is all part of silver's dual-personality behavior, which makes it one of the most interesting yet volatile commodities in the world. We are now seeing 5% intra-week swings in this precious metal, which will only amplify over the next few years.

With the approach of $20 this week and then backing off again into the mid-range of the consolidation, silver's short-term pattern is increasingly appearing to be a bull-flag correction. Seen often on individual stocks, this pattern generally represents a half-way downward-sloping pause in a primary advance.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-735" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/c_Silver-price-1year.png" alt="Silver-price-1year" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

In this case, the surge (or "pole" of the flag pole) was from early June at $15.80 through July at $21.25: an amplitude of $5.45.

<a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver</a> made a 2-week bottom in mid-August at $18.50, and it is quite possible that this was the low for the bull flag correction.

With an amplitude of $5.45, the pattern would target a <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver price</a> of $25.45 when added to the breakout point of the flag. Such is in line with our expectations for silver's seasonal advance to come. We will confirm the pattern when the short-term (dashed teal-color) resistance line is broken to the upside.

Our worst-case scenario would be for silver to fall into the lower range of the green support band near $17.50 prior to its next attempt at an advance.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Gold's summer consolidation stretches on for another week, and this time tests the lower boundary of the support zone labeled below, closing at $1,310. For the week, the international currency of last resort closed down by $24 or some 1.8%.

This was the 4th distinct hit on the green support zone since June, which closely matches the number of attempts gold has made to overcome the long-term downtrend shown below in magenta. All eyes now turn to the US Federal Reserve policy meeting on Wednesday as the next likely catalyst to kick gold out of this consolidation in one way or another.

<img class="size-full wp-image-753 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/a_Gold.png" alt="a_Gold-FED-polycy" width="1240" height="928" />

On the subject of the coming Fed meeting, there is a continuous falsehood portrayed in the mainstream media regarding the effects of rising interest rates on the prices of precious metals. Another one of these misleading articles was published this week in Bloomberg.

&nbsp;

<strong>The falsehood is that rising interest rates are negative for precious metals.</strong>

The theory is that rising interest rates increase the attractiveness of interest-bearing accounts, such as US dollar-denominated bonds or savings accounts. This, in turn, should cause investors to turn away from gold, as it pays no interest.

The mainstream media will publish articles explaining this theory every few months, typically when gold has been weak in price, as a way to explain the recent trading action. Here is a snippet of the recent article from Bloomberg and the highlighted section reveals the erroneous statement: <em>"Gold would get hit pretty hard in a rising rate environment."</em>

<em><img class="size-full wp-image-754 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/b_Article-Bloomberg-Gold.png" alt="Article-Bloomberg -Gold" width="643" height="898" /></em>

Yet the actual data for rising interest rates and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">precious metals prices</a> is completely contrary to this statement. All we need to do is examine the history of rising interest rate cycles and gold prices, and the correlation is plain to see.

&nbsp;

<strong>Interest Rates and Precious Metals Prices</strong>

Let us give two examples to illustrate the true correlation between short-term interest rates and precious metals prices.

First, the example from the most recent multi-year rate hike cycle. Below is a chart of the 2003 - 2007 time period, showing short-term interest rates rising from 1% to 5.25%. Following that is a <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">chart of gold prices</a> over the same time period.

&nbsp;

<img class="size-full wp-image-757 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/C_Fed_20032007.jpg" alt="Fed-20032007" width="798" height="357" />

<img class="size-full wp-image-758 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/D_Gold_2003-2007.jpg" alt="Gold-Price-2003-2007" width="886" height="578" />

Here, we can clearly see that a rise in interest rates corresponded to a rise in gold prices, as the price of the metal rose from $325 to over $800 during this same time period.

Now let us look at a longer-term example, the multi-decade rise in interest rates from 1955 - 1980.

<img class="size-full wp-image-759 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/E_Fed-Funds-rate-1955-1980.jpg" alt="Fed-Funds-rate-1955-1980" width="645" height="359" />

<img class="size-full wp-image-760 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/F_Gold-1955-1980.jpg" alt="Gold-1955-1980" width="876" height="579" />

To be as concise as possible: a rising interest rate environment over these 25 years was the backdrop to the largest precious metals bull market in modern history, as gold broke the dollar standard at $35 per ounce and advanced over 2,000% through 1980.

&nbsp;

<strong>Why do precious metals rise with rising interest rates?</strong>

In order for this to make sense, we must alter our perspective of the Federal Reserve from what is discussed in the news. <strong>The Fed is a reactive, not a proactive organization.</strong> The Fed responds to incoming data related to prices, employment, and the solvency of its own member banks -- and then responds with monetary policy after the fact.

The Fed has no crystal ball. Being reactive, when would the Fed logically decide to raise interest rates? Only when it is forced to do so. In other words, the Fed raises interest rates only when the inflationary effects of its previous money-printing cycle are starting to be obvious in the broader economy.

<a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold </a>is the ultimate protection from inflation, and this is why it tends to rise in a rising interest rate environment. Like a well-trained hound, gold sniffs out looming inflation better than any data possibly could.

It is uncertain why the mainstream media continues to purport this false idea regarding rising interest rates and precious metals prices. It may simply be one of those myths that takes on a life of its own, or it may be scare tactics designed to separate investors from their gold at critical junctures. Regardless of the cause, one would think that such prominent news organizations would check their data before publishing these claims.

<strong>So, for the record: when do gold prices fall relative to interest rates?</strong>

A careful look at the correlation between gold bear markets and interest rate cycles over the last 70 years reveals that <em>gold typically declines <u>after the peak</u> of a rate cycle and as rates remain falling or low</em>. Such was the case for the peak and subsequent declines in gold both in 1980 and in 2011.

Current interest rates at 0.25 - 0.50%, having fallen since 2008 in the short-term cycle and since 1980 in the long-term cycle, are nowhere near a peak at this juncture. If anything rates are now forming a long-term low, from which we may see decades of increases into the future.

<img class="size-full wp-image-761 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/G_Fed-Interest-Rate-History.png" alt="Fed-Interest-Rate-History" width="1500" height="579" />

&nbsp;

<strong>One Final Point</strong><strong> </strong>

This long-term perspective does not necessarily mean that gold will rise on the day of a Fed interest rate hike, whether it be this week, or at the next meeting in December. As ironic as it may be, some short-term traders believe the myth they have been taught through these erroneous articles, and so it becomes self-fulfilling as they sell gold on the news of a rate hike.  All the while, long-term investors are accumulating the metal knowing that the inflation from years of money-printing is starting to appear in the system.

Do not be mislead by the mainstream press: the Fed is reactionary. It increases rates when inflation is noticeable -- and history shows gold rises over the course of such cycles.

		<title>Fed Hints at Rate Hike in December</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While the Fed this week once <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/09/19/rising-interest-rates-correspond-gold-prices/">again </a>did not raise interest rates, the significant surge in precious metals seen on Wednesday was based on the change in the wording used in the accompanying policy statement. Whereas over the past few meetings the Fed has given little indication that it was considering a second interest rate hike, this time the central bank used the following distinct language: <em>"The case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened."</em>

As investors, we must remember that we are still living in an unprecedented age for low interest rates. At the 0.25% - 0.50% target rate, this is still the lowest that interest rates have been in the history of the Federal Reserve, including the following two critical time periods:
<ul>
 	<li>The Great Depression: rates hit a low of 1.5%</li>
 	<li>World War II: rates hit a low of 1.0%</li>
</ul>
Can we imagine that what is happening in the world economy currently must be deemed by the Federal Reserve to be more severe than both the Great Depression and the largest international conflict in the history of planet Earth?

Not only are rates lower than in each of these periods, but they have been held lower for a greater number of years than at each of these previous troughs, now eight years and counting below the 1.0% mark. Of course, holding interest rates so low requires a continuous electronic "printing" of new money, which is used to buy the entire short-end of the interbank bond curve. The longer that rates are held below what the market would naturally set them at -- usually between 2.0% - 5.0% -- the more inflation the Fed is building underneath the system.

The data to support this coming wave of inflation can be seen from the graph of the total reserve balances held at the Fed. Recall that what appears on this chart is money the Fed has created in order to buy sufficient bonds needed to force interest rates lower:

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-772" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/a_total_reserve_balances_maintained_with_federal_r.jpg" alt="total-reserve-balances-maintained-with-federal-reserve-banks" width="1220" height="556" />

&nbsp;

We can see that there is no precedent for the amount of money created since 2008. The Fed -- and other major world central banks -- have embarked on a money-printing spree that will go down in history as an experiment like none other. Note that there <strong>*is*</strong> a line on this graph dating back to 1950... it is just so low on the Y-axis that it barely registers when compared to the nearly $2.4 trillion created by the bank since 2008.

The strange thing about inflation is that once central banks create it -- they cannot control precisely where it flows after it enters the broad economy. Similar to turning on a fire hose in an attempt to water the garden flowers, some may flow to the intended destination, but far more will eventually flow to unintended areas.

Thus far, the recipients for most of the inflation are clear, and we have discussed them in past articles: world bond and stock markets, which are both at all-time highs simultaneously (in itself an unprecedented situation).

But nothing happens in a vacuum.

Newton's Third Law of Physics says: "For every action there is an opposite and equal reaction." And it appears that the unintended consequence of the Fed's actions are about to be felt elsewhere: in the US dollar.

&nbsp;

<strong><u>US Dollar</u></strong>

The chart below shows the US dollar as measured by the Dollar Index, a trade-weighted basket that measures the value of the US currency versus the sum of the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Euro (EUR), 57.6% weight</li>
 	<li>Japanese yen (JPY) 13.6% weight</li>
 	<li>Pound sterling (GBP), 11.9% weight</li>
 	<li>Canadian dollar (CAD), 9.1% weight</li>
 	<li>Swedish krona (SEK), 4.2% weight</li>
 	<li>Swiss franc (CHF) 3.6% weight</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-773" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/b_USD-index.png" alt="usd-index" width="1125" height="669" />

&nbsp;

We have been following this chart now for several months, as the dollar has been consolidating for nearly two years between the 92 level and the 100 level on the index.

Over the long run, we expect <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> to be moving higher in all currencies, no matter what happens with one fiat currency versus another... but over the short run, gold tends to see its most significant advances when the US dollar is weak, as <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold is priced</a> primarily in US dollars for purposes of international trade.

Thus, let us remember that the advance seen in gold from the December 2015 low of $1,045 per ounce to the recent high of $1,378 has taken place within a backdrop of a relatively stable US dollar, which has only fallen from 100 to 95 on the Index.

It appears that gold is now waiting for further signals from the currency market in order to begin its next move, and as the dollar has continued to consolidate, so has gold.

Yet these consolidations will not continue forever.

&nbsp;

<strong>Recent Technical Analysis on the Dollar</strong>

On the chart above, we can see converging sets of trendlines, shown in royal blue for primary downward trend and teal for short-term uptrend. These trends have been converging since December 2015 and May 2016, respectively. One of these trends is due to break within the next 4-8 weeks.

While consolidations such as this are inherently neutral when viewed in isolation (they can break either upward or downward), when we view the action within the context of the preceding advance the nearly two-year consolidation in the dollar is increasingly taking the form of a broad long-term top. Indeed, it would be rare to see such a lengthy pattern result in a continuation move higher.

From the short-term perspective, our "hints" that the break will be lower come from the two cracks in the support zone below 93 on the index. These cracks have been warning signs that buyers of the dollar are not as resolute in supporting the currency as many would believe. This is in contrast to the resistance zone at 100, which has shown very distinct and unhesitant selling pressure each time that level is reached.

Should the lower converging (teal color) trendline break in the dollar in the coming weeks, the currency should be making new lows below the 92 region in short order. This move is expected to coincide with the converse breaking of the long-term downtrend that has held the price of gold lower from 2011 - present (see Gold Analysis, below).

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Gold Analysis</u></strong>

Gold made another attempt to overcome its long-term downtrend this week, reaching $1,343 on Thursday before falling back to $1,337 by the end of the week.

This was the fifth attempt by gold to break higher from the current consolidation. Each attempt represents another opportunity as buyers chip away at the overhang of sellers. Although we cannot be certain exactly when the line is going to be crossed, a breakout of this magnitude will leave no doubts when it does occur.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-774" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/c_Gold-price-2015-2016.png" alt="gold-price-2015-2016" width="959" height="718" />

&nbsp;

Resistance is clearly defined by the downtrend as between $1,355 - $1,378.

The rising blue trend channel since the December lows is now coming into focus for support near $1,310, and immediately below that the support zone that has held since June comes in between $1,285 - $1,305.

Longer-term, we must remember that the bottom seen last December was nothing less than a retest of a multi-decade breakout from the 1980 - 2009 consolidation in gold. The move seen from 2009 - 2011 was the initial surge from the breakout. However, multi-decade breakouts do not tend to see their advances finish in two years only. A more significant advance is believed to be in the early stages of developing.

		<title>Gold Tests Important Trend &amp; Dow / Gold Ratio Update</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since the December 2015 bottom in precious metals, gold has risen $272 or 26% from the low of $1,045 per ounce, to close at $1,317 last Friday. From a technical observation, gold is now directly meeting with its rising linear trendline from the absolute lows (shown in blue). This line acted as support to mark the end of the correction in early June. Of course, the line simply represents big buyers who have been showing up in the gold market at increasingly higher levels over the last six months -- and we now want to see if they will show up again this week, just above $1,300.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-783" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_Gold-price-2015-2016.png" alt="gold-price-2015-2016" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

It will be an important test for gold. If the trend channel from the lows is going to hold, it will exert itself within the next 2-3 days, and the price should fail to close below the line for more than one day. This would then set up gold to attempt to break its long-term downtrend (magenta color) by mid-October.

Should the trendline fail -- it will constitute a technical breakdown in the short-term, but all hope will not be lost for the intermediate outlook . The support zone in the region of $1,306 -- which extends down to $1,285 and is shown in green -- has held <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> higher on four separate occasions over the last three months, and it is expected to continue to do so should the linear trend no longer remain in tact.

As investors in the volatile metals, we must expect the prices to move in a series of surges, consolidations, and corrections over the course of the next several years.

Nearing the bottom of the most recent trading range, the mood in the precious metals community has turned decidedly negative in the short-run, despite what has been less than a 5% correction in the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> since late-June. Recent headlines from Bloomberg this week include "Bulls Feeling Frayed as Gold's First-Half Run Fades Into History" and "Gold-Mining Investors hit by the Hitters as Share Rally Sputters".

It is said that corrections can manifest either in price or in time -- and in this case it is clearly happening in the later. Yet no matter which form they take, both price and time corrections serve to set the stage for the next round of advances as weak hands get flushed out of the market and new investors arrive.

When viewing mainstream articles that focus mostly on sentiment, it is helpful to remember that sentiment must necessarily be worst in the terminal stages of a correction, as quotes and headlines come from those who have already sold. And when a critical majority has sold, this is when a bottom in price is imminent.
<h2>Dow / Gold Ratio Update</h2>
The <strong>Dow to Gold ratio</strong> provides an excellent way to view the long-term real value potential for gold relative to the broad US stock market.

As discussed in past articles, the ratio has approached a 1:1 reading twice prior in the last century at precious metals peaks: in 1932 when the Dow crashed to the low 40's and gold was revalued from $20 to $35 per ounce, and again in 1980 when the Dow sat at 850 and gold exceeded $850 per ounce.

We expect that the ratio will hit 1:1 again before this cycle is completed in favor of precious metals.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-784" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/b_Dow-Gold-ratio-long-term.png" alt="dow-gold-ratio-long-term" width="1340" height="737" />

&nbsp;

Updating the analysis, with the Dow at 18,308 as of Friday, September 30 and gold at $1,314 per ounce, the ratio stands at 13.9 : 1. The 1:1 target could thus occur with stocks staying flat and gold approaching $18,000 per ounce, or the Dow falling to 2,500 and gold rising to meet it at $2,500 per ounce. Either way, the result should be over a 90% loss in value in real terms for US stocks before the next precious metals peak occurs.

Although such gains for gold or drops in the Dow may seem extreme given current prices, imagine that the same must have been felt with gold at $35 per ounce and the Dow at 900 in 1968. Yet the two did meet 12 years later.

Presently, the Dow / Gold ratio is in the later stages of a counter-cyclical uptrend, shown by the blue line above, amidst the generational downtrend shown in magenta.

Zooming in above on the counter-cyclical uptrend in favor of stocks since 2011, we see that the advance in the ratio has been halted by the declining long-term downtrend, and is now forming an ugly topping pattern, seen as a bearish-slanted head &amp; shoulders formation in the Dow / Gold Ratio:

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-785" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/c_Dow-Gold-ratio-2012-2016.png" alt="dow-gold-ratio-2012-2016" width="1240" height="737" />

&nbsp;

Once the support of the right shoulder is breached, the intermediate downward target for the pattern is measured at 9.0 on the Dow / Gold ratio, which should correspond to either the loss in value in stocks or the surge in price in gold -- both of which will cause increased attention toward precious metals amongst mainstream investors.

		<title>Gold &amp; Silver Technical Updates</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/10/10/gold-silver-technical-updates/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week gold broke down through both its rising linear trendline and the $1,285 - $1,305 horizontal support that had been supporting <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">prices</a> since the June Brexit vote. By the end of the week gold had closed at $1,257. The importance of these trendlines is apparent as once they were broken to the downside, a cascade of selling was observed in the futures market.

The first point is we must acknowledge the determination of the sellers who showed up each time at the declining long-term (magenta color) downtrend. These long-term trendlines are critical to monitor for exactly the reason that their strength can be so high -- as can be the significance of their eventual breaking.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-794" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_Gold-downtrend-2016.png" alt="gold-downtrend-2016" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

Our best assessment is that the potential for the next low to form will be in the range of $1,200 - $1,251 for gold. Although this is a wide range that is not suitable for short-term trading, there are a confluence of support levels in this region where we place the highest likelihood for a low to now form in gold:
<ul>
 	<li>$,1251 - the 61.8% Fibonacci level of the primary December through July advance.</li>
 	<li>$1,232 - an equal-distance decline of the $$73 amplitude of the June through September consolidation between $1,305 and $1,378.</li>
 	<li>$1,212 - the 50% Fibonacci level of the same advance.</li>
 	<li>$1,200 - horizontal support which held from February through June.</li>
</ul>
When there is a confluence of four technical support levels within such a range, we place a high likelihood for the next intermediate low to form within this price zone.

We should also note that immediately below this support zone is what is labeled "Must Hold Zone" for gold. This region is defined by the 38.2% Fibonacci level of the primary advance at $1,173 and broken October 2015 resistance-turned-support which is appearing near $1,200. This zone represents the lowest possible support for which we could still maintain the thesis that gold is in a new bull market. A break below $1,173 would raise the scenario that gold would form a new low below $1,045 in 2017. We place the probability of this scenario as low at present, but the support region must be mentioned in the course of due diligence.

<strong>Silver Update</strong>

Silver has now come to the lower range of our likely support zone at $17.50, which is also matching the rising linear trendline of the entire advance since the January lows. This further matches closely with the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the advance at $17.42.

The rising linear trendline from the lows has been broken. A recovery of the trend within 1-3 days would constitute a false breakdown in our analysis, but we would need to see <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">prices</a> stabilize above $17.95 by Tuesday for this scenario to manifest.

The bullish posture for silver will remain in tact as long as prices remain above the swing low of $15.85 from June. Such would place the current low at higher than the June low, and maintain the series of higher lows that is essential to the early phases of a new bull market.

We do not have a similar "Must Hold Zone" for <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> as <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is seen to be the primary determinant for the precious metals complex at this juncture.

&nbsp;

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Chinese Buyers Away Last Week?</strong>

An interesting theory has been circulating that last week's declines in precious metals were purposefully orchestrated to coincide with the ironically-named "Golden Week" period in China. During this semi-annual 7-day holiday, the Chinese financial markets are closed, including the new Shanghai Gold Exchange. As China is still the world's largest consumer of gold, there is merit to the idea that Chinese firms would have withdrawn their bids for physical metal prior to the week, which would have left the market more vulnerable to short sellers.

Ultimately we cannot know the exact extent to which the holiday impacted the losses in the metals last week. We must play the cards we are dealt, and that includes the breakdowns seen over the last several trading days. No matter who did the selling, we want to chart that activity as accurately as possible. My ultimate belief is that any attempts to manipulate markets can only succeed in the short run. The longer a market is suppressed, the more imbalance builds up beneath the system, and like a beach ball held under water, one day it will eventually shoot higher into the air. Throughout history groups have attempted to prop up or suppress one market or another, but they universally fail -- and this time will be no different.

		<title>Gold Predicts Advance in the US Dollar</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/10/17/gold-predicts-advance-us-dollar/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The big driver impacting the precious metals market this past week has been the US dollar. We have been watching this converging wedge formation in the dollar index, a measure of the US dollar versus a basket of foreign currencies, for several months, and this past week the formation broke higher in favor of the dollar (see red highlight circle in the chart below).

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-801" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_gold-price-USD.png" alt="gold-price-usd" width="1240" height="737" />

&nbsp;

As we know, over the short run <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold tends</a> to move inversely to the US dollar.

Interestingly, gold had broken below its $1,305 consolidation support <em>a week before</em> the dollar broke higher from the pattern above. Gold, essentially, anticipated the strengthening of the US dollar prior to it actually occurring.

We can see the inverse correlation between the dollar and gold on the chart below clearly over the last 3 weeks.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-802" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/b_USD-Gold-correlation-october.png" alt="usd-gold-correlation-october" width="838" height="559" />

&nbsp;

Now since October 6, gold has been giving the opposite signal to the preemptive drop from late September. Essentially, gold has moved sideways in a consolidation since that date, even as the dollar has continued to rise.

What gold is saying over the last few weeks is that it doesn't "believe" the dollar's most recent advance is going to last.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Watching for a Top in the US Dollar</strong>

Refer back to the US dollar index chart at the top of the article.

Again, the dollar has broken higher from the wedge consolidation defined by the two converging trendlines since May of this year. Closing at 98 on the dollar index last week, it has been the 3 point move higher from 95 to 98 which has resulted in gold's drop from $1,315 to $1,250.

The dollar is now nearing another test of the 100 level on the index, a measure which has acted as resistance for the last two years.

&nbsp;

We will be watching the action in the US dollar index carefully over the next few weeks. <strong>Should the dollar further levitate toward the 100 resistance zone while gold continues to hold its recent lows, it will be a strong signal that the dollar is putting in a long-term top in this region.</strong> Accordingly, the most recent decline in gold will be seen to be simply the first minor correction in the early phases of a long-term secular advance higher, an advance that ultimately should correspond with a worldwide awakening to the knowledge that all currencies -- not just the US dollar -- are inherently flawed in their present fiat form.

That said, and as we have witnessed, we should expect the most sizeable moves in gold to occur opposite the US dollar, as a weakening in the world's reserve currency will have an outsized impact on the entire world financial system as it is defined in the post-Bretton Woods era.

Let us watch the related moves in the dollar index and gold closely over the next several weeks.
<h2>Gold Analysis</h2>
For the week, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> was up $3 from the Friday prior to close near $1,255 on the New York COMEX exchange.

The historic store of wealth is attempting to stabilize in the strong support zone we have identified below in green. Notably, thus far despite several intraday drops into the zone, buyers have stepped in each time and the precious metals has closed each day above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire December through July advance. This level comes in at $1,251.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-803" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/c_Gold-downtrend-october.png" alt="gold-downtrend-october" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

The higher within the zone of $1,200 - $1,251 that gold can stabilize, the more likely that the long-term downtrend line (magenta color) will be broken on the next series of attempts, which early estimates suggest could occur as early as December.

As technical-based analysts also looking at downside potential, we continue to identify the $1,173 price level as the final "must hold" zone for gold's new bull market. If this level were to breach, it would tell us that -- despite the fundamentals that we know to be true (worldwide central bank money printing, unprecedented low interest rates, unsustainable debt levels) -- another fundamental factor must then be impacting the markets that we must not be fully aware of.

One of the founding principles of our investment philosophy is we cannot possibly know ever factor that is impacting a set market at a given time, because the market is composed of hundreds of millions of individuals, each with their own set of hopes, fears, strengths, weaknesses, assumptions, research, and goals.

Yet to be successful, we do not need to know what each individual is thinking. By paying attention to the sum of the market -- which manifests in the price that is printed each day -- we can align ourselves with the strongest trend as it is occurring.

We have no desire to be right on the fundamentals but wrong on the actual market, a problem which plagues many fundamental-only based investors. As of now, it still appears that the December bottom was an important long-term flexion point... but if anything changes this outlook, we will be sharing it with you here.

		<title>US Dollar and Gold Continue Positive Correlation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The positive correlation we were monitoring last week between the US dollar and the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> has become even more pronounced since the last update. The US dollar, as measured by the Dollar Index, has continued to rise toward medium-term resistance on the charts near the 100 level. Meanwhile, gold is refusing to break down below its recent low of $1,243 set on October 7.

These time periods in which both the US dollar and gold move in the same direction are rare, but not unheard of altogether. They tend to happen during one of two main scenarios:

1) Market panics -- when both assets are viewed as safe-havens, and rise simultaneously (or after the panic ends, when both fall simultaneously).

2) At major inflection points -- when one market is advancing, but the other market does not "believe" the legitimacy of the other market's move.

We see no panic in the stock or currency markets recently, so it appears that as of today, it is gold which is not believing the US dollar's continued advance.

The update below continues from our chart last week, and shows both <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and the US dollar since the recent gold low of $1,243 on October 7 (UUP is the proxy ETF for the US dollar index, GLD the proxy for gold):

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-824" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_UUP-GLD-october-2016.png" alt="uup-gld-october-2016" width="641" height="425" />

&nbsp;

In the absence of a market panic, this simultaneous movement by both gold and the US dollar in the same direction will not last forever.

One of these markets will soon be proven "wrong".

Should the dollar continue to advance toward the 100 level while gold remains firm, the precious metal will be signaling that the dollar is due to put in its final medium-term top of the nearly 2-year consolidation shown below, before the next reversal should take it below 92 into 2017:

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-825" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/b_USD-index.png" alt="usd-index-october-2016" width="1240" height="737" />

&nbsp;

However, should the dollar advance above 100 in a meaningful way, we would need to monitor the action in gold closely, as it could represent a major headwind for the precious metals market for at least the next year.

As of present gold continues to show little respect for the dollar's advance.

Note that on the chart above, the RSI indicator (top section) has once again approached the overbought level above 70, which has marked previous tops in the dollar to within a few weeks through 2015.

Because the dollar is approaching important long-term resistance, we will continue to show the dollar/gold relationship on a regular basis over the coming months. Especially with the possibility of a Fed interest rate hike before the New Year, and with the US election only two weeks away -- the major currency markets are primed for trend-setting action through December.

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Gold Update</u></strong>

As of the New York COMEX close on Friday afternoon, gold had gained $12.20 for the week or nearly 1%, to close at $1,267.70.

Looking ahead, initial resistance will be showing up in the former support zone which was broken during the early October decline, between $1,285 and $1,305. With a high probability, we expect buyers will need at least two distinct attempts to break through this resistance level.

For support, we are looking for gold to continue stabilizing above or within the zone of $1,200 - $1,251, shown below in the green band. If gold can maintain the recent October 7 low of $1,243 as the bottom for this correction, it will be setting up a bullish posture to overcome the declining long-term downtrend (magenta color) as early as December, and at latest by March.

We continue to believe the overcoming of this long-term downtrend will represent a major shifting point in the psychology of the precious metals market, and should precede a significant dollar-negative event by 6-12 months.

We note that the RSI indicator (top of chart) had become the most oversold since just prior to the December 2015 bottom. In a bull market, RSI readings below 30 generally signify medium-term bottoms, although this does not preclude the possibility of further time needed within the support zone over the coming months.

&nbsp;

*****

As the US election is just over two weeks away, during the next two weeks we will have increased commentary on how the election results may impact the markets, most notably the US stock market, and of course the precious metals.

		<title>Americans Wary of Both Candidates - How Will Markets Respond?</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/10/31/americans-wary-candidates-how-will-markets-respond/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The US election is only eight days away, and the race has tightened over the last week. While Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton remains ahead in most polls, Republican candidate Donald Trump has recently taken the lead in key swing states such as Florida and Ohio.

Our general stance on the election is largely agnostic. We are not hugely fond of either candidate. Trump certainly would be a wild-card should he be elected, while Clinton would likely remain more tied to the existing political establishment, continuing the general trajectory of most of Obama's initiatives of the last eight years.

Yet from our viewpoint, it is not so much which candidate ends up winning the election, but rather the recent polls showing Americans' negative sentiment toward both candidates which is most noteworthy.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone wp-image-865 size-full" title="clinton-trump-unfavorable-rating" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_clinton-trump-unforable-rating.png" alt="a_clinton-trump-unfavorable-rating" width="650" height="596" />

&nbsp;

Indeed, polls released this week show that <strong>for the first time ever, the majority of Americans view both candidates as "unfavorable".</strong> (Note: the most recent percentages are now higher than even the chart above shows, at 52.4% unfavorable rating for Clinton and 59.1% for Trump.)

The level of distrust amongst Americans toward their politicians is at an all-time high.

As a corollary, it is fascinating to note that Americans' trust of the mass media is also now at multi-decade lows. The most recent 2016 poll from Gallup shows that the percentage of Americans who have "trust and confidence" in what they are told from mainstream news outlets has fallen to just 32%.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/b_Americans-trust-mass-media-chart.png" alt="b_americans-trust-mass-media-chart" width="600" height="370" />

&nbsp;

Something unprecedented is happening here both politically and culturally. This is at least one reason to hold some physical precious metals outside the banking system, regardless of what happens to the prices in the near term.

&nbsp;

<strong>Markets and Elections</strong>

Historically speaking, since 1900 the data we have available does show that democratic Presidents correspond to better performances in the broad stock market over their terms in office, statistically higher than the performance seen with republican Presidents, as shown in the chart below.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-867" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/c_DJIA-stock-market-change-president.png" alt="c_djia-stock-market-change-president" width="1067" height="1136" />

&nbsp;

However, correlation certainly does not equal causation.

For example, the data does not take into account the myriad of other factors that could have impacted the market averages over these years, such as central bank policies, debt accumulation due to war, or the bursting of market bubbles.

The data is also only expressed in nominal terms. When inflation-adjusted or priced in gold, the data would reveal quite different results.

We also know that there are delays as new policies work their way into an economy. Could higher stock market performances in certain years came as a result of policies implemented in prior administrations?

We cannot know any of this for certain. What we can do is observe the correlation and attempt to decipher what it will mean going forward: democrats do tend to see better stock market performances during their years in office.

&nbsp;

<strong>The Election and Precious Metals</strong>

Turning our attention to precious metals and the election outcome, let us first consider the above-mentioned factor concerning higher stock prices under democratic Presidents. Because stocks and gold are often (but not always) counter-cyclical assets, broadly speaking we can surmise that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> should be expected to perform better under a republican President.

We can observe that the two most significant bull markets in precious metals over the last 50 years began under two republican Presidents: the 1971 - 1980 advance of 2,400% in gold began under republican President Nixon, and the 2001 - 2011 advance of 760% in gold began under President Bush II.

Yet we must recall that the seeds of these precious metals bull markets were sown in the years prior to the republicans taking office, as unsustainable debt and currency depreciation during the prior years eventually forced a revaluation higher in the world's ultimate monetary reserve: gold.

Again, just as we are hesitant to give sole credit to democrats for outperformance of the stock market, we cannot give sole credit to republicans for outperformance of the gold market.

&nbsp;

<strong>The Brexit Effect</strong>

In the coming election, a Trump victory would clearly be a wild-card outcome, as it is not something seen likely in current electoral polls.

Essentially, we believe most markets are siding with the polls and "pricing in" a Clinton victory.

However, markets -- and polls -- are not always correct.

As we saw in Britain with the June Brexit decision in which polls prior to the vote still hinted that the UK would not leave the EU, markets can indeed be fooled.

Since a Clinton victory is already priced in, a Trump surprise win would be a shock for most major stock and currency markets.

As such, we contend that a surprise Trump victory might cause a spike in gold similar to the $110 intraday surge seen on June 24 as votes were being tallied in Britain. Yet this time, the gold spike, should the markets get this surprise, would come not from a falling British pound, but instead from a falling US dollar and/or US stock market.

&nbsp;

<strong>How Will Americans Express Their Distrust?</strong>

No matter who ends up winning the American election on November 8, the most critical trend to follow is the general population that now distrusts <em>both</em> primary candidates and also the mainstream media.

To use the analogy of the popular game, there are not too many dominos that need to fall between the majority of Americans distrusting their government leaders, and at least a portion of those Americans deciding to vote with their wallets and to buy a modest allotment of <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> or <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>.

If you can't trust the President, and you can't trust the media, who can you trust?

It is estimated that still today, only 1% of Americans own any precious metals whatsoever.

Can we begin to fathom what would happen to prices if that percentage were to double, to say 2%? What if 10% of Americans wanted to have 10% of their net worth in gold and silver?

The fundamentals behind this sort of movement into the only asset outside of government control are as strong as they could possibly be. The key question remains timing. It is still early in this cycle. When will more people wake up?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With no change announced to interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve meeting this week, the markets instead focused mostly on the upcoming <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/10/31/americans-wary-candidates-how-will-markets-respond/">US election</a>. Polls continued to show the gap between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton narrowing, now to 1.6%. The correlation between gold and Trump's poll odds has been striking over the last two weeks... and one way or another, the question as to who will lead the United States for the next four years will be decided this Tuesday.
<h2>Gold</h2>
In sum, gold rose this week by $27 to close at $1,304, a gain of 2.2% from a week prior.

As emotions can become extreme at such critical fundamental crossroads, we find it useful to return our attention at these moments to the charts for what is always the primary driver for the entire precious metals complex: the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">price of gold</a>.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-887" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Gold-price-elections.png" alt="gold-price-elections" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

The language of the charts shows us that gold is now directly hitting up against the upper boundary of the broken support zone which held it higher from June through early October, at $1,305.

It would be rare for a market to break down from such a support zone (as happened in October) and then recover it on the first attempt higher, so we would expect to see gold back off in this region, and spend more weeks consolidating between the support established in at $1,245 and the recent high of $1,305. This would then set gold up to make a second attempt to break $1,305 later this year or early 2017. This is what markets "should" do from a technical perspective.

However, a Trump victory would certainly be one of those fundamental triggers that could cause a major breakout on the chart pattern prior to our typical expectation.

For now, we will have to step back and watch the outcome this week. The trading on Tuesday should be fascinating to observe. Whether it is sooner or later, the support and resistance zones that will define the next stages of gold's trajectory are clearly defined, and the most important question we continue to monitor is: "When will gold break its long-term downtrend?"

That break is going to coincide with a fundamental spark that will reveal itself just at the right time. Again, the charts can give us great insight into "what" is happening... the "why" always remains to be seen.

&nbsp;
<h2>Silver</h2>
Silver finished higher for the week by $0.58 cents to close at $18.37, a gain of 3.2%, although well off the high of $18.75 hit on Wednesday.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-888" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Silver-price-elections.png" alt="silver-price-elections" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

As we can see above, silver got stopped in its tracks just above $18.50, the former support seen in late August. From a technical perspective over the short term, $18.50 matches very closely with the $1,305 resistance in gold. A break and sustained close of either of these levels by either metal would give us a strong indication of a breakout to come in the other.

Strong support for <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver price</a> exists between $17.00 and $17.40.

The critical test for silver is that we observe when it breaks the downtrend shown above in blue. We continue to believe <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> will break this trend line within the same timeframe as gold's break of its long-term downtrend (magenta color, page 1).

<strong> </strong>

<strong>A Note on the Fed Statement</strong>

As referenced above, the Fed meeting was generally a non-event this week. However, the language used by the Fed in the non-decision strongly hinted that a second rate hike is due to come, perhaps as early as December:

"<em>Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. </em><strong><em>The Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives</em></strong><em>. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."</em>

This point bears repeating, as the misinformation from the mainstream media is constant and is repeated in almost every major Fed interest rate article: throughout history rising interest rates have corresponded with rising gold prices, not the opposite, as the mainstream press often states.

What we are now witnessing is the very beginning of the <u>slowest</u> rate-hike cycle the Fed has ever engaged in.

Typically over the last 70 years during rate hike cycles, the Fed would raise 0.25% every meeting over the course of 3-5 years. Such was the case, for example, from 2003-2007 as the Fed raised rates from 1% to 5.25% in 0.25% increments, every 6-12 weeks.

Yet during the current cycle, the Fed has raised rates only <u>once</u>, and it has now paused for a full year since that singular rate hike in December 2015. This is the only time in history the Fed has raised rates once, and then paused for the next year. We are witnessing a slow-motion collision course between unsustainable debt levels that cannot afford higher interest rates, and a wave of inflation that is already working its way into various segments of the economy.

Newton's Third Law says: "For every action there is an opposite and equal reaction." The unprecedented interest rate policy we are living through is going to have unprecedented consequences, it is only a question of timing.

Thanks for the analysis. It seems that the Feds will be raising the interest rate after the US election or in around December - January.

		<title>Trump&#039;s Unexpected Victory, Markets Reverse Course</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Donald Trump clinched an unexpected victory for the US Presidential election on Tuesday, which sent major world markets into a temporary panic.  Gold surged, stocks dropped limit-down in the overnight hours, and it appeared gold was on the verge of the technical breakout from the long-term downtrend that we have been monitoring for almost half a year now.

Yet just 12 hours after the election results became known, the markets saw quick reversals of the prior movements, with precious metals and other safety assets being dumped, and risk assets including broad stocks and industrial commodities being bought strongly.

We remain long-term bullish on precious metals for the fundamental reasons that we all know to be true: central bank money printing, government bailouts of private corporations, uncontrollable debt, and negative interest rates in several major nations worldwide.

Yet the challenge at this moment is to come back to a central investment principle: do not fight the market.

What this means is that, as individuals and investors, we may have opinions on what the market should do. We may have fundamental data from sound research to back up those opinions. We may have done thorough due diligence. Yet despite all this, if the market moves opposite to our fundamental research, we must consider that there is more information impacting the market than we are factoring into our equations.

The old investment adage is helpful to remember: "The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."
<h2>Markets Turn After Trump's Victory</h2>
Immediately in the aftermath of the Trump election victory, most major world markets reversed course abruptly and strongly.

Gold and silver, which were up significantly in the hours after Trump's win was decided, reversed suddenly and finished lower for the week. Gold hit a high of $1,335 in the early morning hours on Wednesday, only to close the week near $1,225, almost a $110 drop in just over 48 hours.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-903" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a_TrumpVictory-stocks-dollar-gold-silver.jpg" alt="trump-victory-stocks-dollar-gold-silver" width="1500" height="1125" />

&nbsp;

Similarly, the US dollar and the US stock market, which were showing 2.5% and 5% losses in the overnight hours after the election, reversed course and both finished higher by over 1%, respectively. These are notable intra-week swings.

But it was not only gold and precious metals that fell after the initial surge on Tuesday night. Long-term 20+ year US bonds also dropped, falling over 6% in the last three trading days of the week. This is a huge drop for the bond market, to the extent that 20-year interest rates rose from 2.26% to 2.58% in just one week. This is one of the largest single-week drops in bond prices / increase in bond interest rates seen in the last 20 years.

In sum, after the initial fear reaction as a result of Trump's victory, most major markets did a 180-degree turn and reversed. Safety assets were sold across the board, and risk assets recovered to turn positive.

Let us switch the above chart to view the action in metals only. We are including both precious and industrial metals in the following chart.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-904" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b_Trump-Victory-precious-Metals.jpg" alt="trump-victory-precious-metals" width="1500" height="1125" />

&nbsp;

First, we see that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-copper">copper</a> was the outstanding performer this week, indicating demand for the industrial metals was seen as positive after the Trump election. <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">Palladium</a> came in second, which is, of course, a precious metal with major industrial demand, especially from the automotive industry.

In contrast, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> all fell, the first two being the historic monetary metals.

It appears that markets are pricing in increased industrial demand from the Trump administration and a lesser need for safety assets. We can only speculate as to the reasons for this -- we wonder (half-jokingly): is the wall that Trump intends to build along the US-Mexico border going to be made primarily of copper?

Silver is the outlier. As we know, silver's demand equation still is composed of roughly 80% industrial usage. Why did silver fall more than gold, and not finish the week somewhere in between gold and copper (as it "should" when safety assets fall but industrial assets rise)? What happened to the industrial silver buyers?

Manipulation theories aside (we do not completely discount them, but do not consider them sufficient for making investment decisions), based on the declines seen in US bonds, gold, and platinum, we can only conclude that silver saw large selling from those who were previously holding the metal for its safety / monetary role. We may not agree with their decision to sell, but sell is what they did.

A quick view of the copper chart from 2010 through present reveals the significance of the surge seen in the primary-industrial metal this week: no less than a breakout from the long-term declining trendline since the 2011 highs. [Note: this is the same relative trendline that has been so elusive for gold, from which it has failed to break higher for the past five months. From the copper surge seen this week it should be apparent why we place emphasis on the potential breaking of these long-term trends.]

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-905" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/c_Copper-spot-price-elections.png" alt="copper-spot-price-elections" width="1067" height="799" />

&nbsp;

In sum, copper was up an incredible 10.7% for the week and looks like it is entering a new bull market after five years of declines.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold Analysis</h2>
For the week, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price per ounce</a> fell $80 or 6.1% to finish at $1,224. Yet more significant was the nearly $110 swing from $1,335 on Wednesday to the Friday close.

<strong>The Wednesday reversal consisted of the highest ever single-day volume of contracts traded on the New York COMEX exchange, at 780,000.</strong> This is nearly four times the average daily volume.

Because this historic volume occurred on a reversal day, the $1,335 high is going to require multiple attempts or an equally-high record-breaking volume surge to break through this level on any subsequent rally.

Viewing gold technically, the metal is making a lower low within the strong support zone that we would expect to hold if gold is still in a new bull market. This zone extends down to $1,200, precisely.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-906" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/d_gold-spot-price-elections.png" alt="d_gold-spot-price-elections" width="1125" height="843" />

&nbsp;

The "Must Hold Zone", as defined by $1,173, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the advance, would be the lowest level that we have observed new bull markets to fall while still being in a primary overall advance. A break below that level and quick retests of $1,045 would occur at minimum.

		<title>Dollar Surges, Bonds Fall in Trump Aftermath</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the wake of the Trump election, the US dollar has broken out higher from the two-year consolidation that we have been watching now for many months. Held between the 92 support level and the 100 resistance zone since the beginning of 2015, the dollar hit a high of 101.5 last week, decisively breaking through the aforementioned resistance.

This is important to monitor because over the short and intermediate-term, the precious metals often move counter to the value of the US dollar. (Over the long run, we can clearly observe that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is rising regardless of fluctuations in the US dollar versus other world currencies. More on this below.)

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-914" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a_US-Dollar-index.png" alt="us-dollar-index" width="1055" height="627" />

&nbsp;

The target for a successful breakout of this nature is derived as equal to the amplitude of the prior consolidation. The fundamental reason for this target is that an equal number of trapped short-sellers who placed their bets during the consolidation are likely to cover their shorts as the breakout advances, thus driving the dollar higher. The prior consolidation featured an 8 point amplitude (100 - 92). Thus, we expect the US dollar to advance to approximately 108 on the index over the next 6-12 months.

If <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> were to fall below $1,200 and toward the 2015 lows of $1,045 again, it would be because paper traders are reacting to this advance now setting up in the dollar.

Longer term, let us never forget that an attempt to determine what the price of gold will be at a given value of the US dollar versus other depreciating currencies is akin to trying to decide which ship is best to stay on amidst the certainty that all ships will sink during an approaching typhoon.

The truth is: all ships will be sinking, just at different rates. Gold is the life raft.

The proof for this can be seen in the long-term view of the <strong>US dollar index versus gold</strong>, where we update the levels at which gold has traded corresponding to the 100 point on the dollar index. Note that since 1980, gold has traded at $700, $275, $375, and $1,200 all while the US dollar has essentially made a round trip back to 100.

As the mainstream media continuously attempts to discredit gold based on movements in the dollar index, it is important that we keep this long-term perspective in mind at all times.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-915" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b_USDGold.png" alt="gold-usd-index" width="1080" height="951" />
<h2>Bond Selling Continues After Trump Victory</h2>
US bonds continue to see major selling since Trump's victory, to the extent that the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond has seen its interest rate rise from 2.55% to 3.01% since the election.

We have long speculated that the final top to the unprecedented 36-year advance in US bonds was nearing an end. Yet bull markets typically end with a bang and not a whimper, and this backdrop usually takes the form of a bubble during the later stages. Bubbles can be spotted on the charts as a multi-year linear advance becomes parabolic during its later stages.

The selling seen over the last two weeks in the bond market brings this idea to the forefront, as bond prices have hit 152, just touching the parabolic curve (blue on the chart below) that we believe is setting up to mark the bubble-like end of this long-term advance.

The only question is: do bond prices have one final surge higher to go to mark a true mania phase in US paper, or has the top already been put into place?

The two trajectories, one envisioning a final blow-off phase for bonds and one assuming that the top has already been put into place, are outlined in green below.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-916" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/c_US-Bond-price-november-2016.png" alt="us-bond-price-november-2016" width="1064" height="632" />
A determining characteristic of bubbles is that they go on longer and higher than almost anyone can fathom, so whether the final top was just put into place, or whether there needs to be one final surge to new all-time highs in bond prices remains to be seen. What we can say is that most people alive today have never seen a bear market in bond prices during their investment careers -- and now after 36 years of rising, it is equally fathomable that bond prices could see 36 years of selling. The ramifications of this are unimaginable, but due to unprecedented debt levels worldwide, most governments could not withstand interest rates above 5%, let alone rates near 14% or 15%, as were seen during the 1970's and 1980's.

Will governments insist that central banks be their buyers of last resort as legitimate demand for bonds falls in the coming years?

The only source of funding that central banks have for this is the printing press (i.e. electronic equivalent). Future gold prices will thus be largely impacted by the bursting of the bond bubble.

----------

Thursday, November 24 is Thanksgiving here in the United States. Major markets will be closed. There will be a half-day (until 1:00pm) of trading on Friday. In sum, markets should be rather slow starting Wednesday afternoon through the end of the week.

Happy Thanksgiving and enjoy the long weekend ahead!

		<title>Gold: Looking for Double Bottom?</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/11/28/gold-double-bottom/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2016 21:50:48 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Let us be very clear: we are bullish on precious metals over the long term. Yet over the intermediate timeframe, the market is giving us signals that the long-term bottoms we are expecting to form may take a more complex path than was originally anticipated. We should stay nimble and be prepared for some twists and turns going forward.

For the last week, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> fell by $30 to close at $1,183 as of the NY COMEX final print, a 2.4% loss for the week. Notably, the low for the week came late Thursday night EST / early Friday morning in Asia, at near $1,171, before bouncing, touching the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement line of the entire December through July advance, and the final "Must Hold" support zone that we have been monitoring for some months.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-938" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a_Gold-price-november-2016.png" alt="gold-price-november-2016" width="1195" height="895" />

&nbsp;

If <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is going to put in a low in this region, it must immediately rise this week above the $1,200 level and maintain a weekly close there. This would turn the break below the $1,200 level into a "false breakdown", and would require us to re-examine the possibility that the next advance is indeed underway. Such fake-outs do occur in all markets periodically, and the only way to identify them is to maintain a close watch of the key support/resistance levels. This is the only scenario in which we could consider the initial advance from 2015 to still be continuing.

However, the bulk of the evidence now in front of us leads to the conclusion that gold will need to at least retest the region of its 2015 lows, if not break below them, as part of a more complex multi-year bottoming formation.

The support below $1,173 is negligible for gold, down to the 2015 lows. Strong support levels are primarily defined by prior periods of consolidative action, and in the case of gold that consolidation took place between $1,200 and $1,305 from February to June. The fact that gold saw little to no buying interest at $1,200 last week indicates those buyers who bought the dips toward $1,200 last spring are no longer participating in the market.

Why are they no longer present? We cannot know. Those buyers were a diverse group of institutions, individuals, and funds from around the world, so we cannot possibly identify a single cause for their sum lack of participation. All we can know is what they (the market) are doing, and align ourselves for the highest probability of success.

Below $1,173, we will next look for a bottom in gold indicated by the new green shading on the chart above, which corresponds to the consolidation seen from November 2015 through early January 2016. This zone of $1,045 - $1,085 is where we would look for the possibility of gold to form a double bottom. The term double bottom is derived precisely because the price reached this level once before, and then comes back to retest (if successful) this level for a second time.

&nbsp;

<strong>Technical Clues for the Next Bottom</strong>

No matter what the exact low price that forms for gold, we will be looking for a specific set of bottoming patterns to come into play. One of the most important bottom indicators will be to watch for a period of outperformance of the mining sector versus the metal itself. As an example, if gold were to fall to $1,045 again, we should expect to see the mining complex bottom several points above its related 2015 lows, as measured either by either the HUI or GDX index.

We will also be looking for a downtrend break in gold, as well as any other number of confirming bottoming patterns: bottoming wedge, inverse head and shoulders, gold outperformance versus CRB commodity index, etc.

These are the bottoming indicators that worked in 2008 as well as 2015, and at least several of them will allow us to target the next bottom as it approaches. Of course, we will not catch the exact bottom to the day -- but the truth is no one will. We will, however, be able to observe the shift in the market for what should be a move equal to, if not greater than, the 2016 initial advance.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>1999 - 2001 Gold Example</strong>

As an example, here is how the last long-term bottom in gold formed, from 1999 - 2001. The pattern featured a support zone between $250 and $265, with an initial advance to $337, a 34% surge that gave back almost all of its gains into the double bottom of 2001. Downtrend breaks were noted in successive fashion in November 2000 and then again in May 2001.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b_Gold-1999-2001-double-bottom.png" alt="gold-1999-2001-double-bottom" width="1177" height="857" />

&nbsp;

For long-term investors, any purchases within the 1999 - 2001 period, even at the $337 peak, were eventually seen to be excellent value once the price of gold exceeded the initial advance in 2002. It then never looked back.

Of course, no two periods in history will match exactly, but the point is that a set of potential patterns exist which tend to define most bottoms, and we fully expect to identify the next one to come.

&nbsp;

<strong>Gold: Looking Forward</strong>

As a working hypothesis, with the expectation of a double bottom to form in gold, we propose the following trajectory for gold over the subsequent two years:

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-940" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/c_Gold-2009-downtrend.png" alt="gold-2009-downtrend" width="1208" height="904" />

&nbsp;

The primary 2013 - 2015 downtrend channel for gold, which was broken in February and shown in light blue, would be set up to act as a second support level for gold near the $1,045 double bottom.

A successful double bottom would then set up gold to challenge its long-term (magenta color) downtrend again in late 2017, with the expectation of a successful breakout either then or in early 2018. By this time, the downtrend would come in much lower, near $1,200. Yet its significance would be no less.

For comparison, we continue to monitor the incredible action taking place in the copper market over the last month. In just four weeks, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">copper</a> has surged 28% to $2.67 per pound.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-941" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/d_Copper-2010-2016.png" alt="copper-2010-2016" width="1203" height="900" />

&nbsp;

A similar 28% percentage gain, should gold break its long-term downtrend next year at $1,200, would result in a surge to $1,536 within four weeks. Such is the type of move we want to be positioned for ahead of time.

		<title>Deutsche Bank Settles in Gold-Fixing Lawsuit</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/12/05/deutsche-bank-settles-gold-fixing-lawsuit/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Friday, Deutsche Bank agreed to settle privately for antitrust litigation brought against the German bank by traders and investors who accused the company of conspiring to fix <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold prices</a> at their expense.

This case holds special interest to me personally, as I was contacted by the prosecuting counsel and gave testimony to some of the dubious trading patterns I have observed over the years participating in the futures market.

<img class="size-full wp-image-961 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Deutsche-Bank-Gold-Dold-Settlement.jpg" alt="deutsche-bank-gold-settlement" width="600" height="300" />

The preliminary settlement was filed in New York this week, and consists of a $60M package.

This follows a similar settlement the bank agreed to pay in October of $38M for conspiring to fix <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver prices</a>.

It still remains to be seen which classes of traders or investors are eligible to receive compensation from the settlement, and the total payout per individual is unlikely to amount to more than a few hundred dollars.

Further, it should be noted that the combined settlements of $98M represent a tiny fraction of the bank's $47 billion revenue for 2015. So the settlement will have negligible impact on the company.

Deutsche Bank officially denies wrongdoing. However, the fact that the bank is willing to settle the case is unprecedented in and of itself. Here we have, for the first time, a large multi-national bank agreeing to settle for actions related to manipulation of the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/category/precious-metals-investing/">precious metals markets</a>.

With this settlement, it is possible that further class action lawsuits could be brought against Deutsche Bank by other parties in coming years.

Four other banks who were also listed as defendants in the case have not agreed to settle yet: Barclays, Bank of Nova Scotia, HSBC, and Societe Generale. Should the case go to trial, a ruling against these banks could result in much harsher penalties than the $98M Deutsche Bank is paying?

&nbsp;

<strong>Manipulation Theories Go Mainstream</strong>

In years past, theories that banks were attempting to manipulate <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">precious metals prices</a> were considered the realm of conspiracy theorists and dismissed by the mainstream media.

However, it is increasingly clear that the precious metals markets represent a special focal point for many institutions, and attempts to manipulate their values are indeed occurring.

It has long been my contention that such manipulation attempts do occur. However, I also believe that such attempts are not more powerful than the market forces itself. Ultimately, the market will win out, and attempts at suppression will fail. This is a lesson from countless examples throughout history: attempts to suppress a given market only result in that market moving higher once the suppression is overwhelmed.

No matter whether the market action on a given day or week is related to manipulative attempts or to legitimate buying and selling, we should still pay attention to where price signals appear on the charts. Both manipulation and legitimate market action do impact the prices at which we must buy and sell physical metal, as well as the revenues and hence market valuations of the companies that mine for the metals in the ground.

Over the long run, we should not want to be involved with the precious metals if they could be manipulated ad infinitum. The fact that we as investors are here means we must have faith that such suppression will fail and the market forces will seek true values.

Over the next few months, we will continue to monitor the settlement and litigation proceedings of these cases, and report on any actions that individual investors should take on the possibility of reparation payments.

<h2>Italians Vote "No" -- Signals Establishment Discontent</h2>
Early Monday morning, we received reports that Italians have voted "no" on Premier Matteo Renzi's reform referendum, and further reports that Renzi will resign on Monday.

The outcome is generally seen as representing a victory for "anti-establishment" voters. The reform referendum was strongly backed by Italy's corporations, banks, and establishment institutions, so the defeat sends a message that is similar in context to Britain's Brexit vote and Trump's victory here in the US.

<img class="size-full wp-image-962 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Italians-Vote-No-Signals-Establishment-Discontent.jpg" alt="italians-vote-no-signals-establishment-discontent" width="600" height="300" />

Here we see over the last six months three major western nations delivering strong anti-establishment and anti-globalist messages to their politicians.

While the impact to the precious metals markets have been minor in the overnight Asian trading immediately following the vote, clearly, the "wind of change" that is blowing in various corners of the political world is gaining in momentum...

&nbsp;

<strong>A Political to Economic Trend?</strong>

From a dual political/economic standpoint, we cannot help but wonder: when will even a small fraction of those discontented with the current system (and willing to vote against it in an election) connect the dots and vote against the same system even more tangibly by selling the local currency and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">buying gold</a> / <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silve</a> instead? It would not take many of the world's discontented citizens to simply buy a few ounces of silver or a single ounce of gold for the prices to skyrocket to multiples of the current level.

The timing for this scenario remains speculative still, but we can indeed see shifts in sentiment in front of our eyes. One thing is for sure: political systems and their fiat currencies are intrinsically related... and no amount of manipulation from Deutsche Bank or any other institution will be able to hold back the "voting" of the global currency market when it finally moves in favor of gold.

		<title>Gold and Silver Technical Updates. Long-term double bottom scenarios</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/12/12/gold-silver-technical-updates-december/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Having fallen for five weeks straight since the Trump victory, gold this week broke through its final technical support of the 2016 advance, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the entire surge, at $1,173, so we must now shift our focus toward identifying the next low that is set to come. For the week, gold fell 1.4% to close at $1,159 as of the final electronic trade in New York on Friday.

The intermediate-term 3-year chart is the most helpful perspective at this juncture:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/a_Gold-december-2016.png" alt="gold-price-december-2016" width="1201" height="899" />

&nbsp;

Two weeks ago, we highlighted the example of the 1999-2001 double bottom for gold, and how this might look should the same pattern play out again, 16 years later. Having seen the continued weakness in gold over the last two weeks, let us now focus on some additional specifics.

The 2013 - 2015 downtrend channel, seemingly forgotten last summer, is the next potential whereby gold should attempt to begin carving out a double bottom. For reference, the channel was formed by five separate hits each on the upper and lower trendlines from 2013 onward, as shown above by the red and orange highlight circles on the chart. It was as clear of a trend channel as we could possibly ask for -- and it was broken in February 2016 as gold exceeded $1,190.

Since that trend channel was indeed declining, even though gold has now come back below the $1,190 breakout point, the precious metal still finds itself above the upper boundary of the channel.

Markets often come back to re-test broken lines and channels, and in this case <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> looks to be setting up for that retest within the next 3-4 months.

The retest of the trend channel should correspond, plus or minus a few percentage points, with the low for the 2015 bottom, at $1,045. Typically in long-term double bottom scenarios, the second low will fail to reach the depths of the initial low by several percentage points. <strong>Thus, our <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/11/28/gold-double-bottom/">double bottom</a> potential exists from $1,045 through $1,080, </strong>as shown by the green band above. The possibility of a nominal new low in gold forming alongside a double bottom in the gold mining sector should also not be ruled out.
<h2>Silver Update</h2>
Silver finished the week positive for the second week in a row, up $0.13 or 0.80% to close at $16.97 as of the final COMEX trade in New York.

This was the second week in a row that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver spot price</a> has moved in an opposite direction as gold when viewing the weekly closing prices. Silver outperformance should be noted to be positive relative strength, which has ramifications for the entire sector, and fitting in with our thesis that a complex long-term bottom is forming in the precious metals, even if the absolute lows remain ahead of us.

The rally this week was halted exactly at the broken support-turned-resistance zone shown below by the black line at $17.25. A break above this $17.25 resistance would hint that a short-term bottom is in the process of forming, although we will feel much more comfortable that the larger decline is over when the upper blue downtrend line is broken, which now comes in at $18.45.

		<title>Gold to Silver Ratio Analysis</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/12/14/gold-silver-ratio/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As shown on the chart below, the defining characteristic of the decline in gold and silver prices since the July/August highs has been the rising trend in the gold to silver ratio.

Of course, this ratio measures the number of <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">ounces of silver</a> needed to purchase one <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">ounce of gold</a>.

The fall in the gold/silver ratio from above 80 in January to 64 in early July corresponded to the advances in both metals with outperformance by silver. However, the rise in the gold/silver ratio since July from 64 to 68 as both metals have declined has shown only marginal outperformance by gold.

In other words, as a sum, since the beginning of the year, silver has outperformed gold when viewing the entirety of the advance and subsequent retracement.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/gold-silver-ratio-2016.png" alt="gold-silver-ratio-2016" width="1206" height="717" />

&nbsp;

<strong>Silver's 2016 Outperformance in Perspective</strong>

The major gold/silver ratio trend breakdown in April (first red highlight circle) was a defining change in the ongoing pattern, after nearly five years of rising in favor of gold (large turquoise channel).

The initial wave lower in the gold/silver ratio (corresponding with rising metals prices) lasted through September. While this initial wave lower was halted at the end of September, we do not expect the former 2011 - 2016 rising channel to be regained again.

In other words: silver outperformance is likely over a multi-year period ahead, even though it will underperform gold during sometimes lengthy corrections.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Different Strategies for Different Investors</strong>

Of course, each precious metals investor comes to the sector with a different set of goals, a different time horizon, and a different tolerance for risk. Whereas long-term investors may find dollar-cost averaging into the lows to be a helpful strategy, those with a shorter-term time horizon may want to focus on following some of these technical indicators along with us.

Those wanting to hold <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> as "wealth insurance" in case of political or economic turmoil are reminded that the best time to buy an insurance policy is not when it has gone up in price, but when it has come down. And those insurance policies are now some $200 cheaper per ounce than they were in mid-summer.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Gold in Foreign Currencies - Clues to Gold in US Dollars</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/12/19/gold-foreign-currencies-clues-gold-us-dollars/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Given the potential for the pending low we are expecting across the precious metals in the next 2-3 months, it is important that we review gold priced in other major world currencies at this juncture.

If gold is going to form a bottom in US dollars, it is going to form concurrent bottoms at different but related key technical zones in other currencies during the same timeframe.

Conversely, if we observe major breakdowns in key technical levels in gold as priced in foreign currencies, it would give us clues that US dollar gold may be heading for new lows.

Although <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold priced in US dollars</a> is the worldwide standard for both trade and mining valuation, the bull market that we are expecting over the coming years is believed to be a worldwide phenomenon. Whereas in the 1970's gold's advance was mostly related to US dollar weakness after President Nixon severed the link to gold, today every currency in the world is fiat, and we have observed the precious metal moving higher over the last decade in multiple currencies.

This situation of not having a single currency backed by <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, in and of itself, is unprecedented, and so we now turn to gold as priced in four other major currencies for perspective on the faith (or lack thereof) other western citizens are placing in their own central bank's regimes.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold in Canadian Dollars (CAD)</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1042 size-full" title="Gold in Canadian Dollars (CAD)" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/a_Gold-in-Canadian-Dollars-CAD.png" alt="a_Gold in Canadian Dollars (CAD)" width="1223" height="727" />

Gold in Canadian dollars hit a high of just over $1,800 over in the summer, with a second attempt to break this level negated following Trump's victory.

Canadian dollar-gold has since given back nearly $300 to close just above $1,515 this week.

The critical technical position of gold in Canadian dollars is evident on the chart above by the long-term (magenta color) trendline that is now being tested. This test represents the second distinct hit on the trendline since breaking the 2011-2014 downtrend in mid-2014 (red callout, above). This trendline dates all the way back to 2005.

We can observe a fairly uniform rising channel having formed since CAD gold bottomed in 2013 at $1,250, with four successive higher highs and four successive higher lows since then.

If gold were to break down through the long-term trendline, it would give us reason for additional caution on US dollar gold.

If gold in US dollars is going to form the interim low we expect in early 2017, gold in Canadian dollars should hold its long-term rising trendline immediately and exceed $1,800 by 2018.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold in British Pounds (GBP)</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1043" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/b_Gold-in-British-Pounds-GBP.png" alt="Gold in British Pounds (GBP)" width="1204" height="715" />

Gold in British pounds had bottomed at £700 in late 2015, before the 2016 advance reached over £1,050 post-Brexit. Since the US election, British pound-gold has given back £150 to close just above £900.

Gold in pounds is now retesting its Brexit breakout point at £900. This is the price below which the metal consolidated for most of 2016 prior to the vote.

From a technical perspective, we would expect to see second-chance buyers in the UK step in between £850 - £900 for an interim low.

If gold in US dollars is to form a double bottom in 2017 and then begin a new bull market, we expect, based on the ongoing weakness across pound sterling exchange rates, that gold in GBP will make new all-time highs as early as 2018.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold in Euros (EUR)</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1044" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/c_Gold-in-Euros-EUR.png" alt="Gold in Euros (EUR)" width="1208" height="718" />

Gold in euros bears many similarities in trajectory to gold in Canadian dollars, yet with the swings in each direction since 2013 showing lesser volatility. Euro-gold bottomed in 2013 at just above €860, broke its downtrend from the 2012 high in January 2016, and has since formed a rising trend channel similar to that seen in CAD gold.

Since hitting €1,250 in July, euro-gold has come back into the middle of its rising trend channel just below €1,100. We will want to see this long-term (magenta color) lower trendline hold for an interim low, with a higher high to form sequentially by 2018 above €1,250.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold in Australian Dollars (AUD)</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1045" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/d_Gold-in-Australian-Dollars-AUD.png" alt="Gold in Australian Dollars (AUD)" width="1202" height="715" />

Gold as priced in Australian dollars is unique in that the price actually broke down in early 2013 from its long-term rising trendline, shown by the red highlight. Since then, AUD gold has formed a cup consolidation, retesting the 2011 high at $1,800 last summer.

<img class="alignright wp-image-1046" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/e_AUD-gold-Cup-Handle.png" alt="AUD gold Cup Handle" width="437" height="387" />

Notably, AUD gold has failed to regain the broken trendline on five separate occasions since 2013 (red arrows). In technical analysis, broken support often becomes resistance, even in a trending market.

Yet the decline from the recent high down to $1,550 still fits in with the model of a consolidation. In this model, we are looking at a cup and handle continuation pattern, which, as shown in textbook example to the right, is derived from a tea cup setting of the same name.

Should AUD gold make a new all-time high above $1,800, it would be an early-warning signal that gold in other western currencies may be headed in that direction within a few years. (It is quite possible for a long-term trendline to break as it has for AUD gold, but for the market to continue on to new highs, albeit at a lesser rate of acceleration.)

A break below the $1,300 level would indicate the likelihood of a long-term double top at $1,800.

At present, the action between $1,300 and $1,800 must be viewed as consolidative in nature until one of those levels is broken.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[2016 has been one of the most volatile years on record for gold: the best first-half performance in 40 years, followed by the ongoing retracement that has seen the bulk of the gains for the metal itself given back.

These moves have left many wondering if this was just a "false rally" in the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">price of gold</a> on the way to a continuation of the 2011-2015 bear market. And while no one can ever say with 100% certainty what the future will bring, with a clear technical view of the markets we are now in the best possible position to capture the moves that lie ahead when they do indeed materialize.

As there are still four trading days left in the year, we will wait until next week to offer a full 2016 year-end review of the precious metals markets and a look ahead for 2017.
<h3>Gold Analysis</h3>
Turning to spot gold itself, the pre-Christmas week featured relatively light trading, with prices finishing at $1,133 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX. Such represents a loss of $3.80 or 0.3% from a week prior.

Notably, this was the seventh weekly loss for gold in a row, the longest such stretch since May 2004. This is an interesting statistic to contemplate. Consider, for instance, that <strong>the last time gold fell for so many weeks in a row was during the early stages of the 2001 - 2011 bull market, </strong>not during a bear market. It is often said that the most severe (percentage per time unit) declines happen during bull markets, as prices must climb a "wall of worry". Will this hold true again? We will know shortly.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1056 size-full" title="Gold-2013-2016" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/a_Gold-2013-2016.png" alt="Gold-2013-2016" width="1205" height="902" />

&nbsp;

Technically, gold is now within sight of the declining broken 2013 - 2015 trend channel we have been monitoring for several weeks, shown in blue above. If the price were to use the broken trendline as support this week, the level to watch for a bounce would be $1,100 precisely. Such a rebound would indicate the potential for a higher-low to form in gold than in 2015. The 2015 bottom zone is labeled by the green band above as between $1,045 - $1,080.

We would place a stronger trust in the low if it were to form as a confluence of the broken blue trendline and the $1,045 - $1,080 support zone. For those two regions to overlap, the bottom would need to wait for the trendline to decline from its current reading at $1,100. Based on the slope of the line, that convergence would happen between February and May of the coming year.

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> is still largely oversold on the daily RSI indicator (red circle, top of chart) below the 30 level, a reading which has corresponded with previous medium-term lows over the past 18 months.

In sum, a short-term bounce should be expected at any moment in gold; however, long-term bottom signals require several converging technical patterns, for which we are still waiting across both the metal and the mining complex.
<h3>Silver Analysis</h3>
<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver spot price</a> fell further than gold again this week, giving up the relative outperformance we had noted during late November and early December versus gold. For the week, silver declined 2.8% or $0.46 cents, to close at $15.76 as of the last trade in New York.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1057" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/b_Silver-price-decemder-2016.png" alt="Silver-price-december-2016" width="1199" height="898" />

&nbsp;

We would like to call your attention to the <u>short-term steep wedge</u> formation now visible on the silver chart above, shown between the teal and blue trendlines. As periodically mentioned, these wedge formation typically represent reversal or bottoming patterns. In this case, we see steep declining highs since early November, and less steep lows forming since July.

While silver could fall further still within the wedge pattern, <strong>a break of the upper trendline should represent a tradable breakout </strong>for those so inclined to initiate short-term trades<strong>.</strong> On the breakout, an initial target will be $16.25, the broken support from November, with a possibility of an advance toward $17.25, the resistance from early December.

<u>However, a word of caution</u>: breaks from wedges as steep as above cannot be relied upon to represent terminal bottoms in and of themselves. The old investment adage: "The steeper the trend, the less important the break," comes to mind here, and is relevant because the wedge in question is extremely steep (for comparison, a less-steep long-term wedge was observed from 2013 - 2015 in the silver market, and represented a much stronger candidate for a bottom).

Because this wedge is so steep, it may not represent the final low for this retracement in silver. However, it should mark an end to the most severe portion of silver's decline.

Another way to visualize the steepness of silver's recent decline-- and hence likelihood of a rebound in the near future -- is to note that the slope can be observed to be forming a reverse parabolic curve since the summer highs, which is approaching an infinite downward rate by late January. Since such an infinite negative slope is impossible for an asset that cannot go to zero, we know that the current rate of decline will necessarily end in the next few weeks, and such should represent the tradable bounce at minimum. The only question is: does silver make its bounce sooner, or after one final drop over the next two weeks. Both options are highlighted in green, below, on the SLV chart (proxy for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver bullion</a>, used to show intraday price/volume data).

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1058" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/c_SLV-chart-ST-december-2016.png" alt="SLV-chart-ST-december-2016" width="1110" height="830" />

&nbsp;

The key technical point is to watch for the break of the wedge as shown on the main silver chart above to indicate when the worst of the retracement in silver is over.

We will put the full-year relative price performance together for gold, silver, and related markets in our 2016 review, next week.

For the year, across the major asset classes that we follow, we note the following 2016 ending performances:

</div>
In sum, despite the wild volatility, the precious metals put in respectable performances for the full year. These were the first gains for the metals on a yearly basis since 2012, which may indicate the beginning of a trend change.
<h3>"No Confidence" Goes Mainstream</h3>
The most significant theme that we perceived across the political landscape for 2016 was a vote of "no confidence" in the establishment regime. This growing voice of dissent was evident across three major political votes during the year and countless smaller movements worldwide.

First was the vote by British citizens to leave the EU in June. Dubbed "Brexit", the vote came as a surprise to most major polling and media outlets. Central causes of the British dissent are believed to focus on issues of the economy, immigration, and sovereignty. And while a debate of those issues is beyond the scope of this publication, we can clearly observe the net result: the resignation of Prime Minster David Cameron and a major signal of dissatisfaction by UK residents toward the established political regime.

Second came Donald Trump's election in November. Again largely dismissed by the mainstream media and polling organizations even up until the night of the election, the Trump victory came as a surprise to many. Trump will be the first US President to never hold prior political office. A significant message that we take away from the US election is that there are many more voters dissatisfied with the largely superficial "Republican/Democrat" divide than were previously believed to have existed. We did not officially endorse either candidate in the US election; yet clearly there is a growing sense of "no confidence" in the political system here in the United States, and many voters chose to voice that sentiment through a vote for Trump.

Last but not least, the Italian citizens delivered a third anti-establishment vote in rejecting the constitutional amendment proposed by then-Prime Minster Matteo Renzi in December. Largely perceived as supportive of large banks and corporations, Italians rejected the amendment by a final count of over 59%. Renzi resigned the next day.
<h3>The Seeds of a Precious Metals Bull Market Are Being Sown</h3>
Angst in the political system is currently being voiced through the democratic process.

However, it is only a matter of time before that distrust is voiced further through the monetary system. When individuals begin to wake up to the understanding that they are being robbed by the central banks -- <em>regardless of which party is voted in or out of office</em> -- they will then move to vote separately with their pocketbooks. And as <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver spot price</a> remain to this day the only assets completely outside the control of major governments or central banks, they remain the focal point of the growing movement against establishment political planning.

This theme of distrust by citizens toward their established political systems and central banks is a key component of our fundamental investment thesis for precious metals.

As of 2016, still relatively few citizens of the major democratic nations have any knowledge whatsoever regarding precious metals, and even fewer own the monetary assets. In our every day lives, how many people do we know who actually own precious metals in any form? I would urge readers to do some random polling at their workplace, at the coffee shop, at the grocery store, etc. If your experience is anything like mine, you will find that the metals are still barely even known as a legitimate asset class amongst average Americans.

Let us examine the silver market: current estimates show that only 2 billion ounces of silver exist in the investable form above ground.

What if 10% of the combined population of the United States, Great Britain, and Italy each wanted to buy 100 ounces of silver, a modest $1,600 at today's prices?

Our back-of-the-envelope math shows that the combined population of those three countries is 450 million. So if 45 million citizens each wanted to buy 100 ounces of silver, the net result would be a new demand of 4.5 billion ounces.

The silver is not there. The result of such demand coming into such a small market would be that the price would be forced upward by many-fold, as the total dollar amount of metal available for purchase pales in comparison to the dollar supply floating around in individuals' bank accounts.

Even though the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> total market size is much larger than that of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, we have data to show that even gold is widely under-owned to this day. Below we show gold as a percentage of global financial assets (data courtesy CPM).

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1067" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/b_gold-percentgold-global-financial-assets.png" alt="gold-percentgold-global-financial-assets" width="757" height="454" />

&nbsp;

At just under 0.7% of global assets, gold would need to rise four-fold to reach the relative peak set in 1980 when it first hit $850/oz and silver briefly touched $50. As silver remains below its 1980 peak to this day, its advance would likely be greater than gold on a percentage basis.

Momentum is gaining in opposition to the status quo political landscape, and 2016 saw evidence in three major western nations. Those voters are willing to step out and cast a ballot. It is only a matter of time before a critical mass makes the connection between the political world and the financial world and casts a further vote via a movement of assets into the precious metals market.

		<title>US Bond Bubble Cracking</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/01/09/us-bond-bubble-cracking/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have speculated often over the past year that long-dated US bonds were near the end of their unprecedented 36-year bull market. More evidence continues to show up that the trend has begun to shift and that what we have called the "bond bubble" of the last decade is set to begin deflating.

The chart below shows the price of 30-year US bonds from 1980 through the end of 2016. Note that yields, which are currently just under 3.0 %, move opposite to the bond price.

The final phase of the bubble has coincided with a parabolic rise in the price of bonds since 2011 (shown in blue). Parabolic curves typically define the final stages of a bubble or mania, and the price escalates ever upward in an unsustainable fashion after what was an orderly bull market in years past.

Note the breakdown that has just occurred over the last month, with bond prices piercing the parabolic curve decisively lower. We do not anticipate a collapse in bond prices imminently, but rather a new trend of lower prices and higher yields to begin developing over the coming years.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1105" title="US-Bonds-price-1980-2016" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/a_US-Bonds-price-1980-2016.png" alt="US-Bonds-price-1980-2016" width="1150" height="684" />

&nbsp;

It cannot be overstated how important this shift toward lower bond prices and higher interest rates will be for the majority of world citizens, as the United States -- and by consequence many allied governments -- have become addicted to the cheap credit supplied by an ever-willingness of bond investors to loan the US government money at ever-lower interest rates.

Everything from national defense, to our financial system, to our social welfare programs, to our real estate markets, have been given their capacities and valuations by the availability of cheap credit via the bond market. All investors who have been active in any market for 36 years or less know only falling interest rates as their financial backdrop.

This paradigm is soon to be flipped upside down, and after a generation of falling rates, it is not inconceivable that a generation of rising interest rates is set to come.
<h3>Gold Versus Bonds</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1106 size-full" title="Gold-Bonds-1980-2016" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/b_Gold-Bonds-1980-2016.png" alt="Gold-Bonds-1980-2016" width="952" height="635" />

&nbsp;

We should note that for much of 2016, and especially during the second half, both gold and US bonds have been moving in tandem, rising during Brexit and falling after the Trump victory.

Notwithstanding the slight outperformance by gold, both were considered "safety assets" and investors generally bought and sold both assets together.

This may lead some investors to fear that gold will continue to decline with bonds, if the bond bubble has burst.

Over the long run, we must state that gold and bonds are intrinsically located on opposite ends of the safety spectrum. While <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> has represented money and retained its value for over 5,000 years of history, bonds are essentially paper contracts which are, in many respects, an inferior asset than even US dollars during an inflationary episode.

Whereas US dollars can at least be used now and converted into tangible assets, bonds represent a set number of US dollars to be paid <em>in the future</em>.

Through studying historic inflationary periods, from the 1920’s in Weimar Germany to the 1970’s in the United States, we learn that such episodes, the single worst asset to hold is a bond. Meanwhile, precious metals tend to be the best performers. So while gold and bonds are currently being viewed by the market as both generic "safety assets", this correlation will not continue indefinitely.

Below we can see that the above relationship, when viewed over a proper timeframe, yields a different perspective: since the bond bull market began in 1980, gold moved opposite it for the first 20 years, only to play catch up from 2000 onward, followed by the brief period of high correlation seen recently:

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1108" title="gold-bonds-2000-2016" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/c_gold-bonds-2000-2016.png" alt="gold-bonds-2000-2016" width="1150" height="767" />
<h3>Gold’s Long-Term Outlook</h3>
Backing out our typical short-term perspective of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> for the longer-term view: we continue to believe that the zone shown in green, between $850 - $1,045 as defined by the confluence of the four important technical levels labeled on the chart, represented the highest likelihood for a long-term bottom after the 2011 – 2015 decline.

Should gold retrace further into the green zone during 2017, we expect it will form a nominal new low in price, perhaps down to $1,000 or $925, as a final bear market bottom. It is quite possible that this low has already been established as of late 2015, with the current retracement representing a higher-low or double-bottom pattern now in formation.

The process that we are navigating in typical weeks through the shorter-term charts represents the complexity with which these longer-term multi-year bottoms form.

		<title>Volatility Expected as Gold Tests $1,200</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/01/16/volatility-expected-gold-tests-1200/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold was up nearly $23 last week to finish at $1,196 as of the final trade in New York on Friday. Such was the third weekly gain in a row for the historically-monetary metal.</span>A technical update on the price of gold is in order after our analysis of December 26 came within a few days of identifying the most recent low at $1,120.  Gold is at a technical juncture, the resolution of which is going to play a large role in defining the trend and level of volatility to be expected for 2017.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1151 size-full" title="gold price volatility 2017" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3.png" width="1210" height="905" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The price level between $1,190 and $1,200 is the most important that we are presently watching (black double line, labeled Initial Resistance). This price zone acted as support for gold once in February, once in March, and once again in late May. When a price level acts as support on multiple occasions, it increases the legitimacy of the buying pressure seen there. In essence, we saw the same group of value-buyers step in each time the price approached $1,200 last spring.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, something changed last November as the price retreated in the wake of the reversal, following <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/11/14/trump-victory-markets-reverse-course/">Trump’s victory</a>. The gold price fell through $1,200 with only so much as a two-day bounce. For whatever reason, those buyers who were present through most of 2016 at this level failed to show up in November.</span>
<h3><b>Gold Approaches $1,200 Again</b></h3>
After bouncing at $1,120, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is now approaching the $1,200 region again, this time from the lower side. In technical analysis, a major principle that becomes relevant is that support typically turns into resistance. What this means is that – all things being equal – we would expect that the $1,200 zone, which saw a lack of large buyers suddenly in November, should again see limited buying activity when the price is approached again.

Thus, our general expectation at this juncture is for gold to back off in the current price region, and to begin to retreat back to December 2016’s lows. A likely scenario we will be watching for is a double bottom, or perhaps a higher low to form here in 2017, when compared to 2015 and 2016’s lows of $1,045 and $1,120, respectively.

However, if gold were to surprise us and continue to advance through $1,200 immediately, it would be an important indicator for 2017. It would show us that a new set of buyers had entered the market who were not present during last November’s decline.

Such would have important ramifications for the rest of the year. First, we would set our sights on the next target at $1,251, which was the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire 2016 advance, and beyond that the $1,300 region, which represents the long-term 2011-2016 downtrend that still holds.However, even more importantly, if we see a surge above $1,200 at this juncture, it would represent the beginning of increased volatility for the gold market for the remainder of the year. In essence, we will be seeing a new group of buyers enter the market – and we do not have enough price data to gauge their buying patterns yet. They could be physical buyers who missed out on the 2016 rally, they could be central banks anticipating the need to support currencies, they could be a new class of traders. We cannot be certain on their identities, but we can be certain that they were not present in significant quantities last November -- so their presence must be considered a source of expected volatility over the remainder of 2017.
<h3><b>Gold Volatility Expected</b></h3>
A<img class="alignright wp-image-1152 size-medium" title="where to find the biggest market moves 2017" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2-300x121.png" width="300" height="121" />s an interesting corollary, below is a cutout from last week’s Bloomberg article, with the title shown at right. The article highlights that the options market, which allows investors to make highly-leveraged bets in either direction for an underlying asset, is pricing in the highest volatility of any sector in the world specifically for the precious metals equities in 2017. Shown by the red shaded area below, the options market is pricing in a 34% volatility premium for the large and mid-cap gold producers (GDX) and a 44% volatility premium for the junior miners (GDXJ).

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The implied volatility premium is the portion of the contract value that options writers build into the option price to cover their perceived volatility risk. The higher the implied volatility, the higher the premium that options writers demand to sell the contracts.</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1150 size-full" title="gold stocks options most volatile 2017" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/1.png" width="825" height="333" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While most readers will be primarily concerned with prices for the physical bullion market, there is a price relationship between the companies that mine for gold and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">the price of gold</a> itself. After all, we are talking about two different sides of the same sector.</span>

So if options writers are anticipating the highest volatility of any sector in the world for the precious metals equities, we can be certain they are also expecting volatility in the value of their products, the underlying metals.
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we monitor the price action around $1,200 for gold over the coming week, let us remember that advances and retracements are expected to be increasingly volatile over the coming year, as new classes of investors enter the market. However, with volatility comes opportunity. </span>

Those looking to avoid the expected gyrations this year would do well to consider a strategy of dollar-cost averaging into their positions over a number of months, while those on a more active trading program will benefit by keeping in mind the technical levels mentioned herein.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

The Trump era is officially upon us. While we are politically-independent here and not officially supportive of either major American party, we believe Trump’s election and inauguration last Friday is part of a larger worldwide trend in the emergence of “no confidence” votes against the mainstream political establishments. Manifesting here in the United States, Trump’s tenure should be a particularly unique period of history to be an observer of, with reverberations to be felt around the world.

Case in point: Trump is the first President in modern history to openly criticize the Federal Reserve for its money-printing practices. Saying Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen should be “ashamed” of keeping interest rates too low (which requires printing money to buy short-dated bonds), accusing the Fed of creating a “false economy” and engaging in “political things” – this is unprecedented rhetoric coming from a presidential candidate during a major campaign.

The Chinese proverb says: <em>“May you live in interesting times.”</em> Indeed.
<h3>The Fed and the White House</h3>
The last president to openly criticize the Fed is believed to have been George H. W. Bush, who spoke about the central bank <em>after</em> his 1992 defeat. Ironically, Bush blamed the Fed for <strong><em>not printing enough</em></strong> money, saying: <em>“I think that if the interest rates had been lowered more dramatically that I would have been re-elected President, because the [economic] recovery that we were in would have been more visible.”</em>

Fast forward to last September, in which the relationship between the White House and the Fed over the preceding generation was perfectly illustrated by Hillary Clinton when she said: <em>“You should not be commenting on Fed actions when you are either running for president or you are president.”</em>

So now we have Trump who indeed seems comfortable commenting on Fed actions while running for president. Will he consider criticizing the central bank while actually in office?

Consider that Rebekah Mercer, daughter of billionaire hedge-fund CEO Robert Mercer, sat on the executive committee of Trump’s transition team. She is expected to play a key role in fostering Trump’s agenda during his presidency. Her father, Robert Mercer, in addition to being head of the famed Renaissance Technologies fund, was the chief backer of the Jackson Hole Summit in August 2015, a private financial symposium designed to stand in contrast to the Fed’s own conference held at the same time and place.

The principle themes of the Mercer-funded summit? <strong>The abolishment of the Federal Reserve and a return to the gold standard</strong>.

With the advisory and financial backing of billionaires with anti-Fed leanings, will Trump be the first president in modern history to question the seemingly omniscient central bank during his term?

And how would most Americans – who are still largely unaware that the US dollar is not backed by any tangible asset – respond to a president questioning the institution that issues our fiat currency?

Any significant move of assets into <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> by a substantial portion of the United States (or world) citizens would cause a price acceleration unlike anything witnessed thus far in our analysis.

This is why, even as we endeavor to profit from the shorter-term swings in price that occur, we always advocate that investors hold a <em>certain</em> portion of their assets in a core metals position, stored as far outside the banking system as reasonably possible.

And so as Trump begins his first full week in office, the first active president to openly criticize the central bank in modern history, we once again try to filter out the charged rhetoric that appears in the mainstream financial and political press and turn as always to the charts.
<h3>US Dollar Update</h3>
In a confounding example of either early-presidential double-talk, or perhaps a reference to the singular currency-devaluation policies of China, Mr. Trump – who spoke so harshly of Federal Reserve money-printing on the campaign trail – stated on Tuesday that the US dollar was “too strong”.

The result on Tuesday was to send the dollar back to 100.2 on the Dollar Index, down over 1% for the day against a basket of foreign currencies.

It is here that words from politicians can become misleading and we must focus on regular identification of key zones on the charts:

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1162" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/a_USD-Dollar-Index-jan-2017.png" alt="USD-Dollar-Index-jan-2017" width="1014" height="881" />


While the dollar has been weak over the last month, roughly corresponding to <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold’s price</a> rise from the December lows, this price action must still be viewed within the context of the breakout from the 2-year consolidation shown above between 92 and 100 on the index.

What we see thus far is simply a higher retest of the breakout zone.

We must respect the dollar breakout until proven otherwise, as it will tend to exert a negative drag on the precious metals in a typical trading environment.

We would consider the move in the dollar to have failed and thus to constitute an ominous long-term “false breakout” should the index close below 99.5, the spike low seen on December 8. Such a failed advance can typically lead to a strong reversal in the opposite direction.

Of course, the dollar and precious metals do not always move in opposite directions, and are sometimes highly correlated, a topic we will examine in more depth in the near future.

Happy investing this week, as we enter what should be a fascinating time to be a market observer if the new president does openly decide to criticize the Fed at any point during the next four years.

That's pure politics. She was probably betting that statement would gain her friends in high places (of all sorts).  You see what happened to JFK when he talked bad about the feds.

It's a statement that is hard to believe that anyone would publicly make.  "Can't talk about it".    Hmmmmm.

I'm hoping gold drops because that would mean things are going well and regular every-day Americans are doing well.    Who would really want gold to sky rocket or be much higher than it is today?   Such a person or entity would not care about the well-being of the United States.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Gold Technical Update – Short Term Gyrations Amidst Long-Term Bottom</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/01/30/gold-technical-update-long-term-perspective/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold was resilient over the last two weeks in holding up over the $1,200 level, and indeed almost had us fooled that it was about to ignore this resistance and continue to advance higher.  Yet after several failures to mount a sustained advance, gold succumbed to selling pressure by Tuesday. For the week, gold closed down $16 or 1.4% to finish at $1,188 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday.   </span>

Although <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> did push above the $1,200 figure marginally, the message of the market here is of sellers who showed up every time gold attempted to make some distance above the round number. We can thus update our primary gold chart below, with Initial Resistance labeled as $1,200 - $1,215.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1174" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-1.png" alt="Primary Gold Chart " width="1199" height="898" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our short-term expectations for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> continue to call for lower prices. At the same time, we can tentatively draw a new trendline between the December 2015 low and the higher December 2016 low, as shown above in blue (dashed).</span>

It would be extremely healthy action to see the new trendline tested and held for a second time at a nominally higher level, such as $1,130 - $1,135. This is where gold would meet the trend if it were to test it this week.
<h3><b>Gold’s Long-Term Basing Perspective</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Backing out the timeframe, periodically it is beneficial to strip away previous annotations and start with a blank chart, to gauge the big-picture trend of the market.  Below is gold from 2011 to present, with minimal annotations near the current price – instead of with a focus toward the major pattern developing over the last five years:</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1175 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-2.png" alt="Gold Long-term Perspective" width="1203" height="900" />

Despite the weakness is seen since July, what is emerging here in gold is a five-year “cup” base pattern. This basing pattern features multiple swings of $300 higher and lower in both directions – but as a sum, we are observing a clear rounded bottoming pattern, with a reduced rate of decline from 2013 – 2015 now giving way to the beginning of an advancing market.

Strong evidence for the shift in trend can be seen from the fact that the 2016 high of $1,378 clearly exceeded both the 2015 high of $1,305 and the mid-2014 high of $1,345. A bear market is defined by lower peaks – and when a new peak, such as that seen in 2016, exceeds a prior one – it is telling us that the market is in the process of changing behavior.
<h3><b>Anticipating Short-Term Potentials</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, these changes take the time to play out and are filled with wild short-term gyrations. The question that we still cannot definitively answer is: was the recent December 2016 $1,124 low the bottom for the entirety of the correction off 2016’s peak?</span>

The above base scenario assumes that it was – and if so, after a somewhat higher low due to form within the next few weeks, gold should continue two-steps forward, one step backward advances through the remainder of the year to re-challenge the 2016 high at $1,378.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, let us imagine that the recent low does not hold and that gold continues to grind down further for several months – retesting the 2015 bottom in the vicinity of $1,045. The two hypotheticals are presented below through the green target callouts:</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1176" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-3.png" alt="Gold Short-Term Potentials" width="1200" height="913" />

&nbsp;

<b>Neither of the above two scenarios would change the validity of the basing action we are observing in the long-term cup formation above.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If a double bottom or a grind below $1,100 in gold must occur, it will only expand out the timeline of the basing formation, not change the overall pattern. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of the higher high in 2016 amidst a lessening rate of decline over the three years prior should not be underestimated (large red circle, above). This market is in the process of changing its trend after the 2011 – 2015 decline… it is only the precise gyrations that remain to be seen and navigated.</span>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My only concern with this analysis ignores the possibility that the rally from the Jan. 2016 low occurred in three waves, versus the "five" required for an impulse wave.  As a result, it's more likely this "3" represents wave "A" of an A-B-C upward correction of the downtrend underway since 2011, with wave "B" still underway.  Once complete, wave "C" should be another rally wave.  However, if wave "B" bottoms at a new low, then wave "C" will not exceed the high of wave "A".  In our view, it will take several more years to complete the correction that should set the stage for an impulse advance to new highs, though we are confident it will eventually occur.  Our short-term concern rests with the rally into January 2017; a typical topping month since the early 1970's.  Couple that with what seems to be excessive bullish attitudes and you have the ingredients for another short-term bloodbath.  Having said all that, I still think metals belong in EVERY portfolio, like homeowner's insurance.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Thompson Reuters/Jeffries Commodity Research Bureau Index (CRB Index) is a weighted index of 19 commodities that trade on exchanges worldwide, composed of energy products, precious and industrial metals, and agricultural commodities. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We typically perform a relative strength analysis of gold or silver versus the CRB commodity index below our primary precious metals charts. This gives a quick reference to see if <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold </a>and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> are mostly being impacted by their inclusion with other world commodities (as funds and institutions will often buy “a basket of commodities” for investment purposes all at once), or if there is something unique happening to the precious metals irrespective of other commodities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the weightings and components of the index have changed since it was first published in 1947, the CRB is still largely the best measure we have for broad price trends amongst major world commodities. The 19 specific contracts now included: aluminum, cocoa, coffee, copper, corn, cotton, crude oil, gold, heating oil, lean hogs, live cattle, natural gas, nickel, orange juice, silver, soybeans, sugar, unleaded gas, and wheat.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is a chart of the CRB Commodity Index from 1980 through the present, with relative strength comparisons between gold versus the CRB and silver versus the CRB below it:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1233 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/CRB-02.06.17-1024x924.png" alt="Chart of the CRB Commodity Index" width="840" height="758" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important point to note on this chart is that </span><b>worldwide commodity prices are currently at lows not seen in over 40 years. </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Commodity prices are lower than they were during the dot-com bubble, lower than the recession of 2001, and – astonishingly – lower than during the worldwide financial crisis of 2008-2009.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To imagine that the global demand versus supply equilibrium for industrial &amp; agricultural commodities is poorer than it was during the greatest financial crisis of our lifetimes is difficult to fathom – but it is exactly what the charts are telling us.</span>
<h3><b>Precious Metals Relative Strength</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below the main chart are ratios showing gold versus the CRB and silver versus the CRB. These ratios show the relative strength between the precious metals and the 19-commodity CRB Index.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we can see that gold has outperformed the basket of commodities 300% since 2006, while silver has outperformed 350%. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another data point we can reference is that while the CRB is now below its 2008 financial crisis lows, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> is still well above its 2008 crash low ($680 per ounce), as is silver ($8.50 per ounce), respectively.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus… something happening to the precious metals that are not happening within other commodity markets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is strong evidence that not all commodities are being treated the same within the investment world.</span>
<h3><b>What is Relative Strength Telling Us?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This outperformance since 2006 is in stark contrast to the near tandem price action that bound precious metals to the rest of the commodity complex between 1982 and 2006. This performance is visible from the nearly flat-line on the relative strength charts during that timeframe (red highlights).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We speculate that starting around 2006, amidst increased monetary debasement by central banks and unsustainable debt loads by a world government, a certain portion of investors began to favor the precious metals for their historic monetary roles. This is a demand that is above and beyond the usage the metals have in industrial fabrication, which is what was appearing across the rest of the commodity complex. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We anticipate that the divergence between precious metals and other commodities which started in 2006 will be seen as the initial stages of what will become a larger worldwide phenomenon over the coming decade.</span>
<h3><b>Applying Relative Strength</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that relative strength indicators are best observed as markets are declining – because we can see evidence of underlying accumulation happening behind the scenes. What we see is that physical buyers have been accumulating precious metals even as their prices were falling alongside other commodities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rising relative strength is important to observe during declines because it shows us which sectors should lead when the overall commodity complex finally bottoms. For example, it is likely that oil bottomed in early 2016 at $26 per barrel and natural gas bottomed similarly at $1.60 per million British Thermal Units (mmBTU). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While there will be opportunities across the entire commodity complex over the next several years, relative strength indicators are telling us that precious metals are poised to lead the advance higher as stabilization occurs across the entire commodity spectrum.</span>

		<title>The US Dollar Is Looking Fragile – Silver to Be Major Beneficiary</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/02/13/the-us-dollar-is-looking-fragile/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens with the US dollar over the next two months is going to be extremely important not only for the precious metals themselves, but for most world commodities and currencies. The world’s reserve currency is at a critical juncture, and we still see few mainstreamg analysts discussing the ramifications for what appears to be a reversal lower in the works for the dollar -- either imminently, or at the latest by end-2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For reference, the dollar had been consolidating for nearly two years between 92 and 100 on the US Dollar Index, shown below. In November, that consolidation broke out to the upside, which corresponded with the weakness seen in precious metals late in the year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This past week we have seen a bounce in the dollar at the lowest possible technical level for us to consider the November 2016 breakout in the Dollar Index to still be valid. Specifically, after falling for the last five weeks, the dollar rebounded at 99.5 and closed the week higher by 0.9%, to finish at 100.8 on the Index. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The medium-term perspective is updated below:</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1272" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Image-1-Feb-13-1024x609.png" alt="The medium-term perspective is updated below:" width="840" height="500" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the dollar held at the lowest threshold where we could still consider its breakout to remain valid (99.5) the US currency is looking increasingly fragile from a technical standpoint. </span>

<b>The weakness of the breakout is not indicative of a market prepared to move higher over the long run.   </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As an important data point: the most recent low of 99.5 (second retest of the breakout) matched exactly the level of the first retest from November 2016.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We thus do not have a higher low in the US Dollar Index following the initial breakout. New bull markets, especially in their early stages, should be characterized by higher highs and higher lows for medium-term pivots.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout from a two-year consolidation </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feature an impulsive move higher, and subsequent retests (lows) should come at sequentially higher levels.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, at this time we can observe that the most recent low in the dollar was not higher than the December low. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is negative technical divergence – and it leads us to suspect a reversal lower of a multi-year magnitude is in the early formation stages. The only question is: does sustained dollar weakness materialize within the next two months, or will a grinding advance continue for the remainder of this year first? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not have enough data yet to answer that question; however, those with an eye for long-term secular trends in the commodity and currency markets should be paying attention to this action in the US dollar very closely.</span>
<h3><b>Silver to Be a Major Beneficiary<img class="alignright wp-image-1273 size-medium" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Image-2-Feb-13-300x201.png" alt="Silver over Gold " width="300" height="201" /></b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is to be a falling US dollar backdrop either soon or within the next year, we would expect inflation to begin to pick up in the United States. Generally speaking, a falling US dollar will cause prices of commodities and international trade items to be more expensive as priced in the falling currency.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metals should “sniff” this inflation out ahead of time, like a well-trained hound. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, in an inflationary environment, silver should outperform gold on a relative basis, as the former has greater industrial usage in electronics and solar fabrication -– industries which would be supported by overall rising prices.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is exactly what we observe since the recent December 2016 lows, as <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> has outperformed <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> by over 5.3% in less than two months.</span>
<h3><b>Silver Recent Technical Analysis</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the week as a whole, silver finished higher by $0.45 cents or 2.6% to close at $17.93 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on
Friday.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The advance in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver spot price</a> this week resulted in a break of the best-fit trendline of the primary declining channel that we have been observing since early July (royal blue trend channel). This is a positive sign for the entire precious metals complex and continues to strengthen the legitimacy of the breakout we saw above the $17.25 (black horizontal line) resistance two weeks prior.</span>

<img class="alignright size-large wp-image-1274" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Image-3-Feb-13-1024x767.png" alt="Silver Recent Technical Analysis" width="840" height="629" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver looks healthy at this juncture, and despite the continued rising from the December lows, we observe that the RSI indicator (top of chart) it not yet at an overbought reading, as it was during intermediate peaks in 2016. Silver appears to have more room to run on this advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We should expect some grinding price action with short 2-3 day corrections over the next two weeks as traders ascertain the legitimacy of the breakout.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver should be supported at $17.00 - $17.25 on any weakness. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our near-term target for silver is $18.75, after which we will evaluate the possibility of an intermediate correction.</span>

		<title>Gold Targets $1,300</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/02/20/gold-targets-1300/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several unique signals showing us that – barring minor intra-week corrections that could occur at any time – gold is set to move higher toward the $1,300 region before any more significant retracement may be due.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To arrive at this target, we examine both the relative strength of the gold mining complex and also the price action in silver. Based on analysis of these related but separate markets, we can conclude that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> itself still has further room to run over the intermediate timeframe.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us begin by examining the relative strength of the gold-mining sector versus the price action of gold bullion itself. Below we show the GDX large-cap gold mining fund on top with the price of gold immediately below it – stripped of all our typical annotations for a direct examination of relative performance.</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1320" title="GDX large-cap gold" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a_GDXGold-990x1024.png" alt="GDX large-cap gold" width="483" height="499" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The top green band shows that the gold miners are now back to a resistance level between 25-26 on the GDX fund, which was previously reached both last August and immediately following the Trump-victory in November.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two vertical grey bands correspond to these points in August and November. By following the bands downward, we can observe what the price of gold was the last time the mining sector was valued near 25-26 on the GDX fund.</span>

<strong>The last two times the GDX traded between 25-26, gold averaged $1,305 per ounce.</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The gold mining complex is intrinsically related to the price of the metal itself, as the sector’s profits are derived largely from spot bullion prices. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Closing the week at $1,238 as of the last trade on the New York COMEX on Friday, the mining sector is already pricing in nearly a $67 per ounce increase in spot <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To further the case for the $1,300 gold target, we turn next to the latest action in silver.</span>
<h3><strong>Silver Analysis</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Friday, we note that gold’s cousin rose for the 8</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> week in a row last week, rising 0.5% or $0.10 cents to finish at $18.03 as of the final bid in New York.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We maintain a target of $18.75 for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, based on the amplitude ($1.50) of the bottoming pattern observed prior to the breakout above $17.25 in late-January. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be rare for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver price</a> to achieve a higher target without gold moving higher as well, and so the silver analysis that follows has direct implications for the $1,300 gold target referenced above.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1321 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/b_Silver-1024x766.png" alt="silver price forecast 2017" width="840" height="628" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the break above $17.25 two weeks ago, silver has been behaving near-perfectly from a technical standpoint. The rise has been steady yet slow, leaving further room to advance on the RSI indicator (top of chart) before an overbought signal is registered above a reading of 70.</span>
<h3><strong>On Trendlines</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an important point that traders may wish to note on the silver chart. Our typical analysis is based on best-fit trend lines, to use the term from statistical analysis. However, as the highs composing the upper trendline do not fit perfectly (no trend lines ever will), and as we are anticipating a breakout with some volatility along the way, it would also be wise to identify an absolute-highs trendline. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is indicated above on the silver chart by the lighter dashed blue line.  Using an absolute-highs trendline, the declining primary trend would come in closer to $18.20.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Which line is more relevant toward the breaking of silver’s downtrend and the establishment of a new period of rising prices?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, the breaking of a best-fit line is most critical.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the absolute highs line is important to keep in mind solely for the reason that some traders will be focusing on it. We should expect some traders to treat it as the defining trendline for the primary decline which began in July 2016. As such, some short-term selling pressure should be seen there.</span>

In due time, those sellers at $18.20 should be taken out during the upcoming advance toward $18.75 if our technical targets are to be met. From that point onward, we will have to re-assess the silver’s short-term setup.
<h3><b>Silver is Leading Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having broken through the best-fit trendline of the primary declining channel (royal blue), silver now finds itself directly challenging the absolute highs trendline. While grinding price action lasting up to 2 weeks could be expected underneath the absolute highs trend line, prices should be well-supported by the $17.25 support level (black line).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect that the absolute highs trend line will be broken within the next two weeks, and when it does, the advance toward the $18.75 target will be quick, needing only 3-5 trading days to reach this level. </span>

Please keep in mind that silver, being an extremely small market at only $20 billion in annual physical sales, is prone to overshoot technical targets – both to the upside and to the downside. Should silver exceed $18.75 on this move, a surge to $19.75 is not out of the question as an overshoot by mid-April.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we observe the price action around the next high, we will begin to gauge the potential for an intermediate retracement. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The price action of both metals is set to get increasingly volatile through 2017, but as the investment adage goes: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“with volatility comes opportunity”.</span></i>

		<title>US Dollar &amp; Long Bond Update</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar Index, which measures the US dollar versus a basket of foreign currencies, is still perched precariously just above the breakout point of its 2015-2016 consolidation. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Closing the week at 101.1, the dollar must remain above 99.5 on the Index in order to avoid an extremely-bearish reversal pattern, which is tentatively taking the shape of a Head &amp; Shoulders top formation (blue callouts).</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1361" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1a-1024x609.png" alt="US Dollar Index " width="840" height="500" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial surge in the dollar seen immediately following Trump’s presidential victory was accompanied by a sentiment which suggested the new administration would reverse trade deficits, boost growth, and cut the US national debt. Yet the sluggishness of the dollar’s advance in recent weeks suggests that the market is having second thoughts about this initial determination.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From a sentiment standpoint, a bearish outlook for the dollar seems to be a possibility few in the mainstream media are contemplating – and for that reason, it represents a compelling contrarian viewpoint.</span>
<h3><b>Euro Fears? The Contrarian Stance</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, reports regarding the possible breakup of the euro-zone <img class="wp-image-1362 alignright" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1.png" alt="Bankers prepare for eurozone break-up risk. Financial Times" width="365" height="333" />have reached almost a fever-pitch, following the UK’s decision to leave the EU last June and uncertainty regarding elections across mainland Europe in 2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems “everyone” knows the euro is set to disintegrate over the next few years – and for that reason, we believe the trade is extremely crowded. As contrarians, when everyone knows that something is set to happen, we must at least ask the question: “Is there not an alternate possibility?”</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1363" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2.png" alt="Euro zone break-up fears back on the table with Italy expected to reject reforms" width="304" height="311" />While the Euro-zone clearly has a unique set of political/economic problems and may need substantial reforms, we must consider the possibility that most of this “news” is already priced in the currency.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, the fact that most investors are convinced of the euro’s imminent collapse leads us to strongly favor the stance that the euro is set to begin a multi-year advance. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And if the euro is nearing the start of a significant advance, the dollar should act conversely. As the largest component of the Dollar Index above is the euro (at 57%), a rising euro will cause the dollar to fall.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All else being equal, a falling dollar will tend to cause more investors to seek protection in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not want to call the top in the dollar prematurely, i.e. before we see a breakdown below 99.5 on the Dollar Index. However, the US currency is acting significantly weaker than it “should” be acting, given the two-year consolidation is seen prior to the breakout. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Something is not right with the way the dollar is behaving technically. If it does not manifest immediately, our best assessment is that dollar weakness should become evident by 2018.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Bonds</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonds represent US dollars to be received in the future. We continue to suspect that a generational timeframe top has been put in on long-dated US bonds. Shown below is the price of the US 30-year bond. Recall that the price of bonds moves opposite to yields, and so a record-high price equates to record-low yields.</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1364" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/3.png" alt="The price of the US-30 year bond" width="1015" height="603" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From a technical standpoint, tops after long-term advances tend to be characterized by an orderly advance which then becomes disorderly. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/01/09/us-bond-bubble-cracking/">US bonds</a>, we had observed an unprecedented 36-year advance in price, defined by an orderly (magenta color) rising channel from 1980 – 2016. The advance in bonds then became disorderly, taking on characteristics of a parabolic blow-off, and breaking the upper trend boundary (shown in blue, above). The top saw a price of 175 on the 30-year bond, which corresponded to a record low yield of 2.1%.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the blow-off, we observed a quick 17% drop in bond prices in 2H 2016. Such a quick drop from an all-time high suggests an initial exhaustion sell-off after an unsustainable advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are not expecting a collapse in bond prices immediately; however, if the above analysis is to remain valid, the 30-year yield at 2.1% should not be matched again – perhaps ever again in our lifetimes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following 36 years of rising bond prices, it is equally fathomable that the bond market could see 36 years of falling prices, corresponding to 36-years of rising interest rates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors had become accustomed to buying bonds for safety over the last generation. Years of falling bond prices should represent an important component of the long-term thesis for precious metals, as some of that safety-seeking capital that in the past would flow to bonds will be diverted in the future toward gold.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The size of the US bond market alone is estimated to be near $12 trillion. Meanwhile, at $1,300 per ounce, all of the gold ever mined in the history of the world is valued at $6.6 trillion (and nearly 50% of that gold is held in jewelry, mostly in Asia). We can see that it would not take a huge percentage of capital to flow from bonds to gold to cause a major price acceleration in the precious metals. </span>

		<title>Fed Hints at Rate Hike – How Will Gold Respond?</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/03/06/fed-hints-rate-hike-will-gold-respond/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve long stated that the mainstream media consistently gets the relationship between gold prices and short-term US interest rates wrong. The charts clearly show over both recent and historical cycles, rising interest rates have corresponded with rising <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold prices</a> – not the opposite, as erroneously stated by the majority of the press.

For example, we’ve shown in the past the following two data sets: gold prices and short-term rates from both 2003 – 2007, and 1955 – 1980:

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1388" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/a_historic.png" alt="a_historic-fred-rates" width="1048" height="671" />

&nbsp;

In this case, the data as presented in the historic charts is extremely clear. And while we are officially told by the financial industry that <em>“past performance is no guarantee of future results” </em>when discussing historical trends, to completely disregard lessons from the past would be akin to saying <em>“past train arrival times are no guarantee of future train arrival times”</em> or <em>“past dinner prices are no guarantee of future dinner prices.”</em>

Sure, we cannot know <em>everything</em> about the future from studying the past. Things do change.

But we can know <em>something.</em>

And is not knowing something about what to expect in a given market better than not knowing anything?

&nbsp;

In this light, I continue <img class="alignright wp-image-1389" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b_Bloomberg.png" alt="bloomberg-gold-price" width="555" height="263" />to be amused and dismayed when I see articles such as this Bloomberg piece every time gold begins to get any attention in the mainstream press (see highlight circle):

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The article’s main point is that gold is behaving “counter-intuitively”, since it has risen after each of the Fed’s two interest rate hikes over the last year. The article goes on to state how rising interest rates are supposed to be positive for the dollar due to higher interest potential, and therefore negative for gold.

Does Bloomberg bother to look at the actual historic correlations between gold and short-term rates as we have shown above?

The main point of this editorial is to give an illustration of why I focus so heavily on charts and not on reported “fundamentals.” Many who believed the Fed would raise rates in 2015 for the first time in a decade stayed away from precious metals complex because they believed the fundamentals written in 99% of the mainstream financial press.

Even the respected economists all agreed on the fundamentals: rising rates are bad for gold.

The historic charts said otherwise.

As we observe the current cycle underway since December 2015, which form of analysis has been more accurate thus far?

&nbsp;

<img class="size-full wp-image-1395 aligncenter" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/c_recent.png" alt="recent-fred-rates" width="760" height="610" />
<h3><strong>Fed Hints of Coming Third Hike</strong></h3>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1396 alignright" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/d_Fed.png" alt="janet-yellen-puts-rate-hike-on-the-table" width="420" height="583" />

Friday was a fascinating case in point. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen gave a speech in Chicago Friday afternoon in which she strongly hinted that the US central bank would raise interest rates for the third time at this upcoming Fed policy meeting, scheduled for March 14-15. The most prescient quote from the speech follows:

<em>"We currently judge that it will be appropriate to gradually increase the federal funds rate if the economic data continue to come in about as we expect</em>. <em>Indeed, at our meeting later this month, the committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate</em>”.

Again, the standard narrative presented in the media is this: an increase in Fed-controlled interest rates should be US dollar-positive, as, all else considered, investors would increasingly choose to hold reserves in the US currency as interest rates rise, since they would be able to achieve a higher yield on these short-term deposits. This is the standard explanation for why rising interest rates should cause the dollar to strengthen, and hence precious metals to fall.

So if the above narrative were true, why did we observe the following reactions in the foreign exchange and precious metals markets immediately following Yellen’s speech? Let us look closely at the charts of both the US dollar index and gold on Friday.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1402" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/e_Fed_announcement.png" alt="fed-announcement-dollar-gld-index" width="904" height="797" />

&nbsp;

Notice that the US dollar fell after the hint of a rate hike, losing over 0.6% in just a few hours, while <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> rose nearly $8 in the two hours after the speech. <strong>This is the exact opposite to the pattern of trading that we are <em>supposed</em> to see with reference to Fed policy and major currency markets. </strong>The US dollar is <em>supposed</em> to rise and gold is <em>supposed </em>to fall on interest rate hikes.

The mainstream media has it flat-out wrong. Friday was a small example of that. Neither the dollar nor gold have behaved the way they are <em>supposed</em> to since the first Fed rate hike in nearly a decade, 15 months ago. We continue to see dollar weakness and gold strength appearing every time either a hint of a rate hike surfaces, or an actual rate hike is announced.

Considering that rates finished a 35-year falling cycle from the 1980 peak in 2015 and could reasonably be expected to be on a rising trajectory for many years or decades, this relationship is of utmost importance to get right.

Will the trend continue on March 15 if another rate hike is announced? We will know soon.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Gold Analysis</strong>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> price fell for the second week in a row last week, down $25 or 2.1% from a week prior. The final print on the NY COMEX futures exchange was $1,201 as of Friday afternoon.

Minor support at $1,220 was lost this week, and we expect this area will act as short-term resistance on the next advance.

Further minor support should be seen at $1,180.

Unless you are a short-term trader (for which we encourage utmost caution in the current technical backdrop) we want to draw your attention away from these minor support levels and toward <strong>the primary converging pattern which must resolve itself by Q3 – Q4 of this year</strong>. That is: the converging of the 2011 – 2017 long-term downtrend (magenta color) and the new rising support line (royal blue) which began in 2015.

Short-term gyrations will take on less and less significance as the two primary trends converge and until one of the trends gives way. When two converging trends meet on a chart, one of them must necessarily break in favor of the other. The outcome typically results in a strong move in the direction of the breakout, as illustrated below by the green arrows.

Based on the trajectory of the trends now developing, this break in one direction or another will occur no later than November, as the trends reach an apex convergence. However, based on past years of observing these patterns, it is generally more likely that the pattern will resolve itself at least 2-3 months prior.

To gauge the likely outcome, we will be watching supporting indicators from silver, the mining sector, the broad commodity complex, and currency cross-pairs over the months ahead.

For the time being, we will be closely monitoring <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> action in the world’s historic store of wealth over the days immediately following this week’s Fed interest rate announcement, due Wednesday afternoon.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1434" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/a_gold.png" alt="gold-analysis-march-2017" width="1126" height="843" />

&nbsp;

<strong>Silver Analysis</strong>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver price</a> fell 4.6% or $0.82 cents for the week to close at $16.92 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.

Although the price has fallen below anticipated support near $17.25, the message of this market is of a retest of the broken primary declining (blue) channel. The breakout came five weeks ago (red callout), and it is common for retests of broken declining channels to occur at a lower price point than the original breakout, due to the fact that the channel is necessarily falling.

By falling rapidly for six out of the last seven trading days, silver has approached oversold status on the RSI indicator (top of chart), indicating a short-term bottom (at minimum) is due.

We expect <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> will be making a bounce from this channel retest, shown by the green callout, on the way to challenging resistance near $18.50 over the next month.

The downtrend breakout would be considered to have failed – a bearish sign that a deeper low is in store for the future – if prices fall more than $0.30 cents further and definitively re-enter the declining channel.

Do you predict a point at which supply needs will break the cycle of market manipulation and silver will return to the $50 prices that we have seen in the past?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Fed Rate Hike Results in Successful Silver Retest</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

If you have been reading this column for some time, you may have noticed that technical analysis can often show us the “what” ahead of time, but the exact “why” trigger typically remains to be seen.

In this instance, let us turn to the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> market, which has continued, over the last three months, to behave more precisely on a technical pattern basis than <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week we noted that the swift decline from $18.50 back down to $16.75 over the previous seven trading days constituted a retest of the breakout seen during the first week of February. The breakout occurred as prices exceeded the upper boundary of the price channel that defined the July 2016 to February 2017 decline. Subsequently, the fall seen through Wednesday of last week constituted a retest of that broken channel. Please refer to the turquoise lines on the chart below, along with the annotations for the breakout and retest:</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1476" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3.20-1024x766.png" alt="Primary Declining Trend " width="840" height="628" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, the charts can often tell us “what” is likely to happen, but the “why” usually remains to be seen.</span>

In  this case, it happened once again to be the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday which provided the bounce from the retest we anticipated on the charts. The 0.25% rate hike announced by the Fed on Wednesday was indeed met with weakness in the US dollar, and inversely strength in the precious metals complex -- most clearly seen on the silver chart above.

In sum, for the week silver rose 2.9% or $0.49 cents to close at $17.41 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX futures market.
<h3><b>Silver’s Primary Downtrend - Broken</b></h3>
Our charts change periodically as new information becomes available. In the above <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> chart, we have new information as to where large buyers are showing up – now visible just above $16.75 in the spot market.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned, the primary declining channel from July 2016 through February 2017 has been changed to the turquoise color (see color key, chart above). In this system of analysis, turquoise represents broken trendlines. Broken trendlines </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be kept in our minds for at least several months following a successful breakout – precisely for the reason that they are often retested by traders some point into the future.</span>

By changing the color of the trendlines from royal blue to turquoise (once broken), it allows a quick visual perspective that still recalls the former trend but does not distract from the newly emerging primary pattern.

In the case of silver, we have a new primary trendline, which must be drawn from the December 2015 low at $13.65 per ounce up to the December 2016 low at $15.75 per ounce. This is shown by the new dashed royal blue line on the chart. With two significant higher lows occurring exactly one year apart, we can now begin to define the support and resistance levels which will be important for silver for at least the remainder of 2017, and likely well beyond.
<h3><b>On Trendline Retests</b></h3>
Note that silver’s breakout from its primary down channel occurred in early February at $17.25 (red callout), and the retest of the same down channel occurred five weeks later, at $16.75 (green callout).

It should be apparent now the value in monitoring these technical trends.

Those who were not following this primary trend in such a manner since July likely would have experienced more fear during the recent quick correction which ended last week.

As we instead saw the correction as a retest of the broken trend channel, much of the potential fear was avoided.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those interested in applying this form of technical analysis, note that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">retests of downward trends may indeed occur at lower price points than their original breakouts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This type of lower retest can scare those investors who are only focused on the absolute price without regard to trend analysis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot get every single twist and turn correct every time, but as any traveler who has ever been lost in a new land without a map or compass will tell you: “Having some information is infinitely better than having none at all.” This has been our experience over many years of observing the precious metals – the charts are valuable maps that we have to guide us.</span>
<h3><b>Silver Going Forward</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, we reiterate that silver has successfully retested its second-half 2016 primary declining trend. Initial support should be seen between $16.75 - $17.25 on any weakness, labeled on the chart above. In a worst-case scenario, we could observe a second-retest of the aforementioned broken trend channel, in the price region of $16.50, which would correspond with the rising primary (blue) trendline from the December 2015 bottom.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our highest probability scenario at this juncture is that silver will begin to advance to challenge the February highs near $18.50, labeled Initial Resistance on the chart, at which point we will need to monitor related signals to gauge the possibility of a further advance toward the 2016 highs near $21.</span>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the central thesis for an emerging precious metals bull market revolves around an increased awareness by world citizens that the currencies they hold as savings are intrinsically worthless, any time we see significant weakness in a major currency we must place our attention there. And when the currency in question is the US dollar – the world’s reserve currency – the examination becomes even more prescient. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar has been weak recently, falling some 2.5% over the last two weeks. Suffice it to say, investors are having doubts that President Trump will be able to deliver on the promises of lowering taxes, increasing infrastructure spending, all while lowering the deficit. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more so, US dollar fundamentals are already “baked into the cake”, by which we mean this is the first time in world history that not a single currency is backed by anything tangible. As a result, world debt levels are at unprecedented highs, and the democratic system itself seems to dictate that politicians continue to print money to fund never-ending promises to their constituents. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexander Tytler, a Scottish judge from the 18</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century, summarized it succinctly, and we cannot disagree with him regarding the unsustainability of such a system:</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is always followed by a dictatorship.”</span></i>

&nbsp;

<img class="alignright wp-image-1553 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Article-1.png" alt="Percent changes in CPI for All Urban Consumers" width="497" height="485" /><b>Consumer Price Index</b>

We can see evidence for the continued debasement of the US currency all around.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent Consumer Price Index data (CPI), released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) a week ago, shows continued debasement in the form of a 2.7% annualized inflation rate across all items (red highlight circle). This means the value of money is declining by 2.7% per year – even above the Federal Reserve’s self-imposed mandate of a 2.0% inflation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While 2.7% per year might seem trivial, consider that 10-year Treasuries are yielding less than 2.4% per year, and a saver in a high-yield savings account would be lucky to earn 1.0% per year. These are negative real interest rates.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[A side note: entire books have been written on the inaccuracies in the BLS’s CPI statistics – in other words, the inflation statistics are generally under-reported. We do not disagree with these claims. For example, the BLS uses what is called ‘substitution’ in their methodology – meaning that if the price of wheat rises by a high amount due to inflation, the BLS will perform a substitution by assuming the average family will instead </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">consume corn. In this way they will leave out the price increase of wheat from the CPI statistics. This largely defeats the purpose of the CPI, which was originally designed to measure the price level of a stable basket of goods. Despite these flaws, the CPI is widely-discussed in the mainstream press, and it gives us at minimum an understated-baseline measure of inflation with which to examine trends.]</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, a 2.7% inflation rate, compounded, means the currency in question will end up losing half of its value every 26 years. So for a saver in US dollars, the Federal Reserve takes 50% of one’s purchasing power every generation through excessive printing of the currency.</span>
<h3><b>Money Supply</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We see further evidence for the relentless inflation through the Fed’s own data on M2 money stock. M2 is one of several metrics used by economists to measure the total quantity of dollars in existence, and it includes physical cash and coins, checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts. It is the broadest measure of money that is currently published by the Fed.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1554" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Article-2-1024x395.png" alt="M2 Money Stock" width="840" height="324" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Side note: an even broader measure of money supply, M3, was published by the Fed up until 2006. M3 included all of M2’s components, plus institutional accounts. The Fed stopped publishing M3 in 2006 claiming the costs were too high to compile and publish the data. This – from an agency that literally owns a printing press and can create money at will.]</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact remains that we live in a world in which monetary debasement is relentless by central banks, and this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has never happened on a worldwide basis in history</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In past inflationary periods, for example Germany during the Weimar hyperinflation of the 1920’s, citizens could protect themselves from rampant money printing by holding US dollars, which were backed and redeemable for 1/20 an ounce of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold </a>at that time.</span>

Presently, not a single currency is backed by anything tangible, and most central banks are engaged in similar policies as the Fed. The only place to turn if one desires to save hard money over time is precious metals.

The truth is, if we lived during a time of stable monetary systems, we would not want to invest in precious metals per-se. Precious metals would be money, or money would be backed by precious metals in redeemable form. One would thus hold precious metals as stable-value savings.

When an appropriate growth investment opportunity came about (such as a business, stocks, real estate, etc.), one would have the savings set aside and ready to invest. When he wanted to sell the investment, he would then convert it back into stable-value savings – precious metals.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But we don’t live in a world of stable values – we live in a world of consistently debased currencies. This presents one of the major challenges of our generation, but also one of the biggest opportunities.</span>
<h3><b>Opportunity – Is There Anybody Out There?</b></h3>
Opportunity arises when an individual sees something that the majority does not or cannot see. In the markets, we must have an opinion that is different from the sum of the other participants in order to make a profit.

If there was no difference in opinion between us and the market, there would be no opportunity for profit.

The opportunity to invest and to make a real return by ownership of precious metals exists because the majority of the world’s population does not yet recognize the unprecedented nature of the worldwide fiat system.

We can confirm this general lack of awareness by simple conversations with those in other communities. Step aside from any internet-based investment communities you may be involved with – and ask the average person you meet at a coffee shop or the grocery store or a bar if they have decided to allocate any savings to precious metals – the answer will almost always be “no.”

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most western citizens do not even know that it is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">possible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to own precious metals, let alone understand the relative merits of gold versus <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, various bullion products, or numismatics.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The point of this is that we must periodically disassociate ourselves from the niche communities we all participate in, and ask the question: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do the majority agree or disagree with us on the merits of owning physical precious metals versus fiat currency?”</span></i>

[If you can honestly answer that the majority of people agree with you and do own precious metals, please send a message to the editor, because I would like to know where this community is located. –C.A.]

Otherwise – as contrarians – we should celebrate the fact that very few people in western society see the value in holding precious metals, for herein lies the opportunity.

The opportunity exists because we disagree with the market at current prices. And if a small percentage of western citizens begin to agree with us – and then divert a portion of their savings into either gold or silver – the values of the metals will be forced upward by a factor of several multiples. There simply is not enough physical metal available for every household to move a portion of its assets into either physical gold or silver at today’s prices.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dear Mr. Aaron,
Thanks for this clear and logical rendition of a maddeningly diffuse set of circumstances/values. It is a fine, short analysis. (In my opinion, short is good when your desire is to convey an idea.)
I have this question though: All the while the Fed was debasing currency with zero-interest rate policy, the dollar has been ascending in "value", measured, as you say by a standard without an index value.
and suddenly when the Fed raises rates (just now) and investors might be expected to pile in--the dollar has got fewer buyers?
I surely agree that Trump's policies will go up-in-smoke and soon, but still can't see what the mechanism is that is pushing USD down here and now. Perhaps it has to do with international sales of US Treasuries?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>US Dollar &amp; Gold Technical Analysis</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/04/03/us-dollar-gold-technical-analysis/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2017 18:52:04 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar remains at a critical technical juncture, and as the currency typically has an overwhelming impact on gold prices over the short-term, we place our primary attention there this week. </span>

After seeming to break down during the overnight hours in Asia a week ago, the US dollar abruptly reversed and moved higher last week, finishing up 0.8 points to close at 100.2 on the dollar index.

The dollar is whipsawing traders at present and is caught immediately in the crosshairs of an important technical battle.

Despite the failure to follow-through in last week’s breakdown, the dollar remains within the zone of former support, which may now act as resistance, beneath 100.5 on the index. This zone is shown in black.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1616" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Image-1-1024x608.png" alt="US Dollar Index " width="679" height="403" />
<h3><b>Dollar Continues to Make Lower Lows</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The important point about the short-term technical picture is that </span><b>the dollar has now put in three separate lower lows</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (99.5, 99.2, and 98.8) since the breakout from the 2015 – 2016 consolidation. This is not the sign of a market prepared to make another multi-year advance. The bids at the retest lows we observe (below 99.5) are not enthusiastic; rather, they are fading as time progresses.</span>

In a strong breakout of a multi-year consolidation, we might indeed expect one or two retests of the former resistance zone. Yet following these retests, a market should move strongly higher to hit the consolidation target (which was calculated as 108 on the dollar index).

We have seen no such strength in the dollar since its breakout. Instead, we have seen three retests – each one occurring lower than the prior.
<h3><b>Could the Dollar Rally?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the dollar does somehow manage to rally at this juncture – perhaps by some jawboning statement by the Federal Reserve about a “strong dollar policy” – we expect the US currency could stage a marginal final rally toward the aforementioned 108 target. If this does materialize, </span><b>we expect to see precious metals not sell-off materially, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">but instead to show relative strength – perhaps consolidating with slight downward bias – as the dollar makes its terminal advance.</span>

Essentially, the precious metals should anticipate that the dollar is in the final stages of its advance, whether or not the exact top print has already been posted.

In retrospect – this is exactly what gold and silver have done thus far during the past 15 months. Gold is up nearly $200 and silver up $4.50 even as the dollar is just shy of a 9-year high. We suspect buyers have entered the precious metals market ahead of time, knowing that the dollar was approaching an important multi-year top.
<h3><b>Short-Term Technical Considerations</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The next few weeks continue to be critical to monitor for the dollar. On the chart above we can see that the US currency is now “sandwiched” between its rising (blue) trendline from the May 2016 low and its falling short-term trendline (teal) from the January high, all the while sitting squarely within the 2015 – 2016 resistance zone (black double lines). This is a tight technical situation indeed.</span>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Gold Analysis</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold advanced nominally last week, rising $2.70 or 0.2% to close at $1,251 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.</span>Minor resistance was seen as anticipated below $1,265. The high trade for the week came in at $1,262. Minor support levels exist at $1,200 and $1,180.<img class="wp-image-1617 alignright" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Image-2-300x225.png" alt="Gold vs CRB Commodity Index" width="475" height="356" /></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The near-term technical situation remains largely unchanged from our most recent update, and is focused upon the resolution of the pennant formation (red highlight) visible on the chart above. </span>
<p style="text-align: left;">As this pattern is drawing closer to a resolution, we will begin to regularly track the precise figures which would constitute a breakout in either direction. Those levels are:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Upper boundary breakout -- $1,290 and falling.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Lower boundary breakout -- $1,155 and rising.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whichever of these boundaries breaks first, the resolution of this pattern will set the stage for the direction of the entire precious metals market for the subsequent 12-18 months. It will be an exciting remainder to 2017 to say the least!</p>

		<title>Silver Reverses Friday – Manipulation?</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/04/10/silver-reverses-friday-manipulation/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday saw a dramatic day in the precious metals market. In the aftermath of the US retaliatory strike on Syria, gold and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> both rose sharply higher in the overnight hours early Friday morning, only to reverse lower by the close of trading for the week. </span>

In general, short-term political and/or terrorism-related market reactions tends to be short-lived. Friday proved to be no exception.Let us turn to an examination of the silver market, which saw the most dramatic move on Friday.For the week as a whole, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> underperformed <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, finishing lower by $0.30 cents or 1.7%. The final trade on the New York electronic access market was $17.96.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1646 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Silver-1024x766.png" alt="Silver Breakout" width="646" height="483" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By failing to overcome the $18.50 - $19.00 initial resistance zone (black lines), this resistance level takes on increasing importance going forward. On any further weakness, we expect the $16.75 to $17.25 region to act as support at the low range.</span>

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1647" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Silver-Friday-300x245.png" alt="SLV Silver Trust " width="300" height="245" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The trading on Friday is worthy of further discussion. There has been mention in other areas within the precious metals investment world that the decline on Friday was entirely due to “manipulation.” On the surface, when we examine the intraday price action, it appears clear that this was not a normal trading pattern.</span>
<h3><b>On Manipulation</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are reading this article, you have demonstrated an interest in profiting from these markets, and not simply sitting idly as a passive victim of manipulation. </span><b>We aim to thrive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not to be victims.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If a market is so manipulated that it can never advance in our favor, we should move onto another market. The reason we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> involved in the precious metals is because we know that the sum of the participants are ultimately stronger than any attempts at suppression. Manipulation may exist, but it is not stronger than the market itself.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is no coincidence that the above selling took place just below the $18.50 level. Our charts had previously identified this resistance level. This was an important swing high from February, and sellers are appearing in this region once again.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We now switch over to the trading desk chart to examine the intraday volume on Friday:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1648" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Silver-2.png" alt="Silver chart on Friday" width="687" height="507" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A buying gap did indeed appear in the trading on Friday afternoon. </span>

However, the volume on Friday’s decline was not abnormally high. As can be seen on the chart, volume was higher at times during the consolidation and advance of the preceding two days.

When a drop such as this happens on moderate volume, it indicates sellers were met with relatively few buyers – not that an inordinate amount of sellers appeared. Such a reversal lower on moderate volume indicates that buyers were exhausted from the previous advance… and when buyers become exhausted, by definition it is sellers who remain. Thus, even a moderate volume of selling can cause a significant drop such as on Friday.

This is exactly the type of trading action that constitutes a consolidation. Sellers are making it clear where they desire to sell, and now we take a step back and observe where the next round of buyers show up. At each successive attempt to overcome the $18.50 - $19.00 resistance zone, futures contracts and physical metal are transferred from weak hands to strong – and when enough silver has been transferred in this way – the next advance will see an absence of sellers at the aforementioned resistance zone. The price can then advance to a new relative high.

Consolidations such as this are extremely healthy. Linear advances higher tend to not be sustained, as we saw in 1H 2016. To the contrary, advances followed by consolidations allow a market to move higher over the long run without drawing too much attention and without the extreme swings seen last year.

Longer-term investors should not be fearful to see a well-defined consolidation continuing at this juncture.
<b></b>
<h3><b>What Do the Silver Miners Say?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is sometimes beneficial to monitor the relative trading action in the silver mining sector and compare it to the price of silver bullion itself.</span>

These are two components of the same industry, and we sometimes see divergences which give us hints as to which direction the markets may be moving over the intermediate term.

Focusing for a moment specifically on the silver miners, which tend to exaggerate declines in silver lower if they are expecting sustained weakness, we note that the miners largely brushed off the precipitous drop seen on Friday afternoon in silver bullion.<img class="alignright wp-image-1649" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Silver-3-289x300.png" alt="Silver mid-week range " width="354" height="367" />

At right we show the SIL silver miners fund on top, and the SLV fund on bottom (silver proxy). Note how the miners closed within the mid-range of the week’s trading, whereas silver bullion closed clearly lower than the week’s trading range. This is the type of divergence we should expect if the miners are not anticipating sustained further weakness in silver bullion.

Silver investors can monitor this relationship to gain some insight as to what may be coming for the metal itself. At least over the short run and after <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/03/20/fed-rate-hike-results-in-successful-silver-retest/">successful silver retest</a>, the mining equities appear to not believe silver will be falling much further.

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A return to the prior consolidation zone between initial support ($16.75 - $17.25) and initial resistance ($18.50 - $19.00) would represent healthy basing action from a long-term investment perspective.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The old investment adage goes: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The longer the base, the bigger the move.”</span></i>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold is inching ever closer to a resolution of the primary converging pattern that we have been monitoring for the last six months. The resolution of this pattern is going to define the trajectory for the precious metals market into 2018, so it continues to deserve our foremost attention. We have supporting indicators from other markets, but we should always evaluate gold as a distinct entity. The price action over the last week has been encouraging, although not yet decisive. For the week, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> finished higher by 2.5% or $31, to close at $1,288 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX late Friday afternoon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two significant technical concerns at this juncture. Please reference the updated 18-month gold chart below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1697 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2011-2017-Downtrend-1-1024x767.png" alt="18-month gold chart" width="588" height="441" />
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold is once again immediately challenging the 2011 – 2017 long-term downtrend (magenta color), which has held prices lower throughout the entire multi-year decline. The exact figure we want to see exceeded and held on a weekly close is $1,290 per ounce to confirm this breakout.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The region between $1,310 and $1,337 represents “Trump Reversal Resistance.” This is the price zone that was tested on the evening of Trump’s presidential victory on November 9, before the $65 intraday reversal occurred in the early morning hours. This reversal lower occurred on the <b>highest single daily volume in gold trading history</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as can be seen from the red callout on the volume indicator above.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>High Volume Reversals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">High volume reversals are near-universally never exceeded on the first attempt to overcome them. The reason for this is the sheer number of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold </a>buyers who purchased futures contracts that day and are now underwater, and who then desire to sell at break-even when the price matches their entry level. Again, gold’s November 9 reversal saw the highest ever daily volume in gold trading history, and so barring an outbreak of major international war, </span><b>we place the odds of gold exceeding the $1,310 - $1,337 Trump Reversal Resistance at near-zero on its first attempt.</b>

Yes, international tensions are on the rise, as can be seen over the last two weeks with the United States retaliation against Syria; the US dropping the largest non-nuclear bomb ever detonated against ISIS in Afghanistan; continued saber-rattling between North Korea, China, and the US; and uncertainty regarding Russian support for Syria. Yet unless world superpowers are literally on the edge of World War III – an event we see as a low probability – the two technical resistance levels referenced above are the ones that will exert primary influence on the gold market here and now.
<h3><b>Early Indicator</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week we noticed early warning trend indicators coming from the gold mining complex. Note in the chart below how the senior gold miners index (HUI) has broken out through its similarly-shaped converging pattern (blue lines). At this juncture, it appears that the miners are hinting that strength is to be expected in gold bullion itself.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1698" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Breakhout-1024x766.png" alt="Breakhout in Large-Cap Gold Miners" width="565" height="422" />
<h3><b>Scenarios for Gold – Remainder of 2017</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The pending breakout pattern for gold will be important because the initial  target of the breakout is calculated to be equal to the 2016-2017 consolidation amplitude: roughly $330 ($1,378 - $1,045, rounded down). As gold’s consolidation reaches an apex at $1,205 (see far right, gold chart page 1), </span><b>the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/02/20/gold-targets-1300/">gold target</a> for a breakout is $1,535 within 6-12 months.</b>

The timing for gold’s next advance therefore depends on when it indeed breaks its long-term downtrend. Two scenarios are thus illustrated on the chart (page 1) above, highlighted in green and orange/red.

<b>Scenario A – </b><b>highlighted (page 1) in green:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short covering and/or geopolitical tensions result in a breaking of gold’s long-term downtrend above $1,290 within the next 2-4 weeks.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold’s short-term advance targets $1,320, as short sellers who were trapped between $1,200 and $1,260 cover en masse.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders holding futures contracts since November 9 (Trump’s victory reversal) exit positions between $1,310 - $1,337.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold stalls in the Trump Reversal Resistance zone and retreats to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its broken 2011 – 2017 long-term downtrend during Q2 above $1,260.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A successful retest of the broken trendline leads to the initial impulsive wave of the advance to target $1,535.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">(Readers may find the nature of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>’s retest of its broken second-half 2016 downtrend, discussed in recent articles, to be a helpful analogy for what we could expect for gold’s retest of its long-term downtrend, once broken.)</span>

<b>Scenario B – </b><b>highlighted (page 1) in orange</b><b>/</b><b>red</b><b>:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold fails to exceed its long-term downtrend within the next 2-3 weeks, and thus falls back to within the converging pennant consolidation.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support should be expected to emerge above the $1,180 - $1,200 support zones.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continued consolidative price action defines trading through mid-Q3 2017.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A resolution of the converging pennant must occur by Q3 – Q4 2017.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early technical indicators (HUI senior gold miners, gold/silver ratio) suggest this resolution will be higher. Target would remain $1,535.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;">Although a low probability, we must mention the downside risk. If the convergence resolves lower through a break of the 2015-2016 rising trendline (blue), gold would target $875 per ounce in 2018 ($1,205 convergence - $330 amplitude).</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold Prices</b></h3>
The next 2-3 trading weeks will set the trajectory for the remainder of 2017. A strong advance through the declining long-term downtrend sets the stage for a first challenge of the Trump Reversal Resistance zone, which should be followed by a retest of the broken line. We then expect a strong impulsive advance to target new highs for gold in 2018.

Conversely, a rejection at the long-term downtrend means gold must continue to consolidate within its primary converging pennant for Q2 – Q3. Early indicators suggest the eventual outcome will be higher, although a low-probability resolution to the downside must be monitored until proven otherwise.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the turbulence in the world political scene surrounding the French election, saber-rattling between the United States and North Korea, and uncertainty regarding Russian support for Syria, let us take the opportunity this week to update our perspective on gold as priced in major world currencies outside the US dollar. If <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/?p=1745&amp;preview=true">gold</a> was found to be violating important support levels across the globe, it would give us reason to question the trajectory for US dollar-priced gold at this juncture. Conversely, if gold as priced in foreign currencies remains strong, it would give us reason to anticipate that US dollar <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold</a> is set advance when we observe a breakout in the consolidation discussed last week.</span>
<h3><b>British Pound to US Dollar (GBP / USD)</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we examine gold as priced in British pound sterling, we should note that just last Monday the pound saw an important breakout versus the US dollar. Below we show the GBP / USD cross pair, from the final drop seen last October in the wake of  the Brexit vote, through present.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1746 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Triagle-Consolidation-breakout.png" alt="Triagle Consolidation breakout" width="527" height="371" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The breakout higher in GBP / USD occurred on Monday as the pound clearly exceeded the triangle consolidation (blue trendlines) above 1.255 which had formed following the terminal stages of the preceding decline.</span>

<b>This breakout signals a reversal higher in British pound sterling in the works.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The initial target for GBP / USD is calculated as 1.318, equal to the amplitude (0.083) of the preceding consolidation added to the apex (off chart, right) of the triangle, at 1.235. It remains to be seen if this reversal develops into a longer-term trend of strength for GBP / USD, but given our suspicion of a multi-year top forming in the US dollar itself, and that GBP represents 11.9% of the dollar index, this breakout should give an initial signal that dollar weakness is likely approaching.</span>

As the strongest periods for precious metals prices tend to correspond with the weakest periods in the US dollar, this breakout in GBP / USD bears monitoring.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[We note here that a reversal higher in GBP is occurring just at the depths of negative sentiment regarding the British pound. Most mainstream media outlets and investment channels have been expecting continued weakness in GBP. As markets so often do, the negative sentiment has already been priced into the current level, and the market has now reversed higher in the opposite direction as prevailing sentiment would seem to dictate.]</span>
<h3><b>Gold in GBP</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning to gold as priced in GBP, we see that the market still remains defined by the long-term rising linear trendline (magenta), which began in 2005. After breaking the 2011 – 2015 downtrend in a surge to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">£900 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in early 2016, gold then saw a follow-through surge above </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">£900 on the day following the historic Brexit vote.</span>

Note that following the climb to over £,050, gold then fell right back to £900 in December 2016, successfully retesting that breakout point.

Gold closed last week at £1,006.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot make short-term predictions about GBP-priced gold at this juncture, but the major point of this analysis is to determine if there are red flags as per the worldwide gold market that would give us warning signs as to US dollar-priced gold. We see no technical weakness from the long-term perspective in GBP-gold, and indeed this market looks set to re-challenge the £1,200 all-time high (set in 2011) on the next surge, likely within 12-24 months.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1747 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gold-in-British-Pounds-1024x609.png" alt="Gold in British Pounds" width="840" height="500" />
<h3><b>Gold in Euros (EUR)</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold as priced in the European common currency continues to look healthy for the continuation of a worldwide bull market, having closed the week at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">€1,202. We note the continuation of a similar long-term rising trend which began in 2005.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Euro-priced gold broke its 2011 – 2016 downtrend in early 2016, and the advance since then has featured a series of waves, the most recent of which clearly exceeded the prior peak of early 2015 (blue arrows). Lows continue to rise as well, the most recent low coming at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">€1,070 clearly higher than the early 2016 low of €970, itself clearly higher than the prior two lows of 2014 – 2015 (magenta arrows).</span>

We will want to see the rising long-term support line hold on any weakness in EUR-gold, just above €1,050. Based on the current trajectory, we can project that EUR-gold will retest its all-time high near €1,400 within the next 24-36 months, or slightly after GBP-gold.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1748 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gold-in-Euros-1024x609.png" alt="Gold in Euros" width="840" height="500" />
<h3><b>Gold in Australian Dollars (AUD)</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, although gold priced in Australian dollars has remained stronger on a percentage basis than any of the preceding currencies, AUD-gold is the only one to have broken its rising long-term trendline back in 2013. The old investment adage, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The steeper the trend, the less important the break,”</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">comes to mind here, as since that technical break, Australian dollar-priced gold has been the only gold cross pair of major world currencies to retest its all-time high of $1,850, which it did in mid-2016 (red callout arrows).</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1749 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gold-in-Australian-Dollars-1024x608.png" alt="Gold in Australian Dollars" width="840" height="499" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The consolidation taking place since 2011 has taken the distinct shape of a cup formation – and it is likely that the retracement back toward $1,550 in December 2016 represented the “handle” of a cup-and-handle technical formation. For reference, the textbook definition of the pattern is shown below (courtesy Investopedia.com):</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1750 size-medium" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AUD-December-2016-300x266.png" alt="AUD December 2016" width="300" height="266" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon a break of the $1,850 all-time high, the target for AUD-gold is calculated as $2,400, derived from adding the amplitude of the cup consolidation ($550) to the breakout point. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We continue to anticipate that a breakout to new all-time highs in AUD-gold, for those who monitor such signals, will serve as an early-warning to holders of gold in other major currencies that similar breakouts are pending.</span>
<h3><b>Gold in Canadian Dollars (CAD)</b></h3>
Gold as priced in the Canadian “loonie” is one of the most precise technical markets clearly visible on the charts. CAD-gold closed at $1,740 last week, a mere 8% below the all-time high of $1,900 set in 2011.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we show CAD-gold since 2002:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1751 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gold-in-Canadian-Dollars-1024x608.png" alt="Gold in Canadian Dollars" width="840" height="499" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distinctness of the rising long-term (magenta) trendline should leave no doubts as to its importance.</span>

The low for CAD-gold was in 2013, at $1,250 per ounce. This major low was confirmed by the breakout in late-2014 of the declining trendline since the 2011 all-time high (red callout).

Note the well-defined structure of the rising trend since the 2013 bottom: a series of distinct higher lows and higher highs. The most recent higher low came in December 2016 at just below $1,500.

Gold in Canadian dollars looks healthy from a long-term perspective, and we anticipate it may be the second major world currency, following Australian dollar-gold, to see a new all-time high above the 2011 mark.
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold in Foreign Currencies</b></h3>
We perform these periodic reviews of gold in foreign currencies to remain cognizant of what is happening across the international investment arena. As a precious metals investor in 2017, you are indeed part of a worldwide movement.

We see no major technical warnings across gold as priced in any of the major western currencies. Initial retests of all-time highs have either already occurred, or they are expected to occur within the next 24 months. Significant advances following lengthy consolidations should be expected upon successful breakouts of these all-time highs.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The strength seen in gold as priced in foreign currencies continues to give us confidence that the worst laggard of the group <strong><i>(</i></strong></span><b>yet the most important for the worldwide recognition of a new bull market) – gold in US dollars)</b> <b>–</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not far behind.</span>

		<title>Gold to Silver Ratio</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/05/01/gold-to-silver-ratio/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The gold to silver ratio (GSR), or the number of ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold, has not followed the timeline of the more aggressive move lower we were anticipating over the last several months. Instead, the ongoing consolidation between 65 – 74 on the ratio has moved toward the upper end of the range over the last few weeks, as <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> has remained steady above $1,260 yet <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver price</a> has fallen to the low $17 range again. </span>

Recall that a rising GSR tends to correspond with falling gold and silver prices, as was seen from 2011 to late 2015.

The final close on the GSR was 73.4 as of Friday afternoon.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1831 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Gold-to-Silver-Ratio-1024x609.png" alt="Gold to Silver Ratio" width="585" height="348" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the most important facet of the above chart is to note that the ratio remains healthfully below the 2011 – 2016 broken rising trend channel (turquoise lines). This breakdown has held for over a year. It would be rare for such a breakdown to reverse and make new highs during the current cycle.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the breaking of this clearly-defined trend channel which alerted us to the changing nature of the precious metals market in early 2016. Although the ratio has not moved lower in favor of silver for the last few months, it remains within the confines of an initial consolidation after the multi-year breakdown. Currently the ratio is facing significant resistance at the 74 level.</span>
<h3><b>Silver to Catch Up</b></h3>
Confirming evidence for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> to play catch up can be seen from a study of the momentum of the ratio’s recent advance, which has reached the highest reading since late February, 2016. The following chart contains the last two years of the GSR, with the momentum indicator (RSI) on top, the GSR immediately below, followed by the price of gold, and then the price of silver, all plotted along the same timescale. Let us examine it closely:
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time the RSI momentum indicator reached above 70 was in February 2016, when <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> had advanced to nearly $1,260, clearly exceeding the previous peak from 2015 at $1,190.  Even so, at that moment silver was “stuck” at $14.75, failing to eclipse its relative 2015 peak of $16.25.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We should recall this early-2016 episode carefully. </span><b>Many analysts at the time asserted that the move in gold was suspect, because silver was not “confirming” gold’s advance each day.</b>

We strongly disagreed at the time, and felt that other technical indicators were confirming a more significant advance to come in both metals. The lag in the move higher for silver was typical of an early-cycle advance in the sector.

<strong>What we can see at right is:</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time the GSR momentum RSI (top of chart) reached 70 this marked the absolute high in the ratio, February 2016.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright wp-image-1832 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Broken-2011-2015-Gold-SIlver-Ratio-Uptrend-203x300.png" alt="Broken 2011-2015 Gold SIlver Ratio Uptrend" width="276" height="408" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">February 2016 also marked a mid-point consolidation in gold after a strong advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver lagged gold’s advance, only to play catch-up over the next four months.</span>

The takeaway is that silver does not need to confirm gold’s move across every timeframe. Silver can lag for weeks, months, or even years in certain instances, and this does not negate the validity of gold, nor the eventual catch-up effect that is to be witnessed in silver itself.
<h3><b>2008 – 2011 Example</b></h3>
Consider an example from the last precious metals advancing cycle. Gold had peaked in March 2008 at $1,033 per ounce, while silver peaked at the same time at $21.50. After the crash of 2008-2009, gold regained its losses and went on to advance to several new all-time highs into 2010, first above $1,033, then above $1,100, and finally above $1,250.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All the while, silver remained below its 2008 peak of $21.50.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was certainly frustrating for silver investors over at least a 12-month period.</span>

<b>GSR with prices of gold &amp; silver: 2008 - 2010</b>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1833 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2008-Gold-to-Silver-Ratio-update.png" alt="2008 Gold to Silver Ratio update" width="435" height="642" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, was gold’s advance suspect because silver was not confirming it? </span>Or, was this an opportunity to accumulate silver, before the period of catch-up? The following extended version of the above chart will tell:

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that the black vertical line shows the ending of the preceding chart. From that point in mid-2010, silver then advanced 180% toward its 2011 peak while gold advanced 25% over the same timeframe.</span>

The major point of this analysis is to be wary of analysts who claim that silver must confirm gold’s moves across every time period. As silver investors, we must be prepared to watch gold lead sometimes for weeks, months, or years. Other technical indicators must be used to determine whether or not we are in a primary advancing cycle in the precious metals. It is not sufficient to simply watch silver lag and label the move suspect.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The present opportunity looks ripe for silver to begin playing catch up over the near-term, even if there are further periods of lag to come as the metals advance through 2018. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our long-term target is for silver to reach at least 17-1 on the GSR, the level last seen at the 1980 precious metals peak of $850 gold and $50 silver.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold price</a> fell $41 from a week prior to close at $1,227 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon. This represents a 3.3% drop from the close a week prior.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A bounce is due, but we clearly see that the gold market wishes to consolidate further over the short-run. </span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1867 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2011-2017-Downtrend-1024x766.png" alt="2011-2017 Downtrend" width="549" height="411" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of the pennant consolidation breakout that must necessarily occur by Q3 – Q4 is not lessened by the consolidation that is underway – in fact, it is only strengthened in its eventual resolution. The more time that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> remains within the context of the consolidation defined by the falling long-term downtrend (magenta color) and the rising blue support, the stronger the breakout that will happen when this pattern is resolved. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Short-term traders are cautioned that volatility and thus opportunity for profit should subside as the consolidation progresses this summer and into Q3. The definition of a converging pennant consolidation is volatility that lessens as buyers and sellers each exhaust one another. The pending new market trend occurs because the next influx of large buyers or sellers is met by exhausted existing participants.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The boundaries of gold’s consolidation now come in at:</span>

<b>Upper boundary: $1,290 and falling.</b>

<b>Lower boundary: $1,155 and rising.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, over the short-run, we anticipate gold is due for a bounce, likely back to the $1,240 - $1,260 region, before consolidation continues through this summer, the technical action for which will be less meaningful within the above ranges until Q3. </span>Our 12-month target upon a breakout remains significantly above or below the $1,205 apex of the consolidation – $1,535 or $875 –  dependent on the direction of the breakout. This target is derived from taking widest amplitude ($330) of the converging consolidation and adding it to the apex of the pattern.
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fed Meeting</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/05/03/daily-market-review-may-3/">The Federal Reserve meeting</a> last week resulted in no change to the US central bank’s short-term interest rate target. The Fed funds rate remains at generationally-low levels, at a range of 0.75% - 1.00%.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The language accompanying the Fed non-decision is being closely securitized by the market:</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Committee views the slowing in growth during the first quarter as likely to be transitory and continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Translated from Fed-speak, this moderately-positive outlook suggests that the Fed will look to raise interest rates at its next meeting, on June 14.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We remind new readers that – contrary to the faulty-logic repeated in most mainstream media outlets – rising interest rates have most closely corresponded with rising precious metals prices throughout history.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, since the first interest rate hike in almost a decade in December</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img class="alignright wp-image-1868" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/US-3-Month-Treasury-Yields.png" alt="US 3-Month Treasury Yields" width="393" height="407" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">2015, each of the following hikes have been met by higher lows forming in the gold price:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>First Fed rate hike – December 2015</strong> – gold: $1,045.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Second Fed rate hike – December 2016</strong> – gold: $1,122.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Third Fed rate hike – March 2017</strong> – gold: $1,198.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our own proprietary technical model, which relies on 3-month Treasury yields as a leading indicator, indeed suggests that a fourth Fed rate hike is pending. At right we show the 3-month yields on top, with the price of gold immediately below, since 2015. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note how US 3-month yields have spiked several weeks in advance of each of the first three rate hikes. Essentially the Fed is responding in policy to higher yields in the short-term Treasury market.</span>

<b>The important point is that the rate announcements have almost exactly corresponded with major lows in the price of gold.</b>

<b>Gold Traders Have Been Wrong Three Times…</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At some point, we should expect gold futures traders – who have gotten this trade wrong on each of the prior three Fed rate hikes by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">selling in anticipation of the rate increase</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (only to see gold rise strongly against them after the announcement) – will wake up and cease this losing strategy. Thus, likely this year, gold may be expected to form its next intermediate low weeks in advance of the Fed announcement as traders wise up.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The futures market is also pricing in a fourth rate hike, as can be seen below by the 83.1% odds that traders are assigning to the pending outcome:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1865 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Target-rate.png" alt="Target rate" width="501" height="442" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Any gold price low above $1,198 on a fourth Fed rate hike would thus keep the trend of higher lows intact on the first four rate hikes since 2007. In a market that may be commencing a period of several years of additional Fed hikes, this trend bears continual monitoring.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">To review the primary operating motive of this series of articles: there are hundreds of fundamental factors driving the precious metals markets (currency debasement, potential stock market declines, geopolitical instability, jewelry demand, and industrial fabrication being the major ones). However, no one can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ever</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> know the sum of all fundamental factors impacting a market. To attempt to do so would require complete knowledge of all the factors impacting of each and every single participant in the international market. Such is an impossibility.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the one place in which every market participant comes together – no matter what his or her specific fundamental belief – is in the decision to buy or sell at a specific price point. Price is where the sum of all market participants converge.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, by studying price foremost, we can observe what is actually happening in the market by filtering out the ‘noise’ that so often accompanies fundamental-only analysis. And by observing trends in price – the sum of the buyers and sellers – we can align ourselves with the strongest ones in an attempt to profit.</span>
<h3><strong>Silver Price Update</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us take a good look at silver this week. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver price</a> finished higher last week by $0.13 cents to close at $16.40 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon, a gain of 0.8%.  </span>On the very short-term, the RSI momentum indicator (top of chart), which had registered the most oversold reading since the 2015 bottom, correctly gave us a warning of this bounce that is underway.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1903 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Silver-most-oversold-since-2015-bottom-1024x767.png" alt="Silver-most oversold since 2015 bottom" width="555" height="416" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The question of how far this advance continues remains to be seen. We would like to see <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> regain its broken rising linear trendline (dashed blue), by maintaining a weekly close above $16.50. Such would register the recent break as a “false breakdown” at the most-oversold reading in nearly two years, which would solidify this low as an important medium-term bottom.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if $16.50 fails to be regained again over the next two weeks and silver tops out below the broken trendline, we will consider this a sign of caution. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A sign of caution does not mean we negate the entire thesis for a Q3 – Q4 breakout in the metals. It would suggest, however, that silver could continue to lag throughout the initial stages of gold’s advance, perhaps failing to exceed its 2016 high ($21.25 ) within the same immediate time as when <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> finally exceeds its relative $1,378 peak. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Support lines between $16.75 - $17.25 has been removed from the silver chart above from the version from several weeks ago because, after serving as an important magnet for prices on four successive junctures from last October through the previous week, the zone failed to hold during the most recent decline. For whatever reason, a new group of sellers have shown up and/or buyers did not appear within that range as we had observed them previously, and so we must adjust our perspective and outlook accordingly.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the positive side, because this level is no longer a support zone, it will also no longer be a resistance level as silver moves higher. Sellers should be largely absent within this region.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is little in the way of resistance until $17.75, which becomes our target on a recapturing of the broken blue trendline at $16.50. This was the pivot low from the April correction.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the long-run, we have targets much higher than $17.75. However, over the short run this should serve as short-term resistance. </span>Silver must at minimum consolidate above Important Support labeled at $15.75 to keep the bull market thesis intact during the remainder of 2017. A break below this level would signal a major red flag for gold and cause us to have to rework the 2017 – 2020 long-term model.
<h3><b>SLW / SLV Ratio</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We often use the ratio between large-cap silver miners and silver bullion itself to gauge short-term pivot points in the metals. Silver Wheaton (SLW) is our large-cap miner of choice, a sector leader across most timeframes. Below we update the chart, with SLW on top and SLV (silver bullion proxy) immediately below. Note that SLW now is firmly within the 2017 mid-consolidation (above the green support band), while silver itself is well below its correlated price zone. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, SLW often discounts short-term price movements that will not last in the underlying silver market.</span>
<p class="aligncenter"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1904 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SLW-well-above-March-lows.png" alt="SLW well above March lows" width="440" height="456" /></p>
<p class="aligncenter"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This leading indicator is calling for a continued recovery in silver over the intermediate-term, although please note that this signal can sometimes occur early, i.e. immediate weakness in silver can occur for the first few days, and then the recovery begins. Those looking to do short-term trading in silver should use other confirming technical indicators such as momentum and trendlines analysis.</span></p>

		<title>US Dollar Breaks Down on Trump Investigation</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/05/22/us-dollar-breaks-down-on-trump-investigation/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2017 15:51:21 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The big news across the currency markets this week was the large drop in the US dollar, which fell over 2% against a basket of currencies representing the US dollar index. The drop came on the heels of the announcement that the US government will launch a special investigation into alleged Russian connections with President Trump during last November’s election. While the investigation may take years to complete (and it could be a propaganda campaign by opposing political forces), the market has cast an initial vote by selling the US dollar in favor of other currencies, most notably the euro and yen.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our focus here is not to dwell on the world political scene, but to illustrate the market reaction to these events, and to show how the currency crosspairs may impact the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">precious metals prices</a>.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1936 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/US-Dollar-Index.png" alt="US Dollar Index" width="1023" height="608" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar has now negated all of the post-Trump rally, returning round-trip to the 97 level on the dollar index, a process which has taken six months.</span>

It is important to note that our analysis began to give hints that something negative was brewing for the dollar back in January, strictly based on interpretations of the chart. We observed lower lows forming in the dollar, and a failure to sustain a breakout to new highs in December, which came after a 9-year advance.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This failure of a market to move higher after an attempted breakout constitutes a “false breakout” in our technical model. When such a false move comes after a 9-year advance, it may signal exhaustion in a market, and a pending trend reversal in the opposite direction.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not until now, four months later, that the news has finally synched with the technical hints. This is almost always the case in technical-based market analysis: the move is observed first on the charts, and the news arrives some weeks or months later to explain the reasons why.</span>
<h3><b>Short-Term Technical Considerations</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The rising trendline from May 2016 has now clearly been broken to the downside (turquoise color, above). The retest failed a week prior (callout), and a continuation lower is now in process for the dollar.</span>

<b>Our initial target for the dollar is 95.5 on the index</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, highlighted above in green. This target is derived from measuring the amplitude of the failed move above the 99.5 former support level to the 103.5 peak (4.0), and subtracting this value below the breakdown point. The real-world interpretation of the target is that we expect an equal number of sellers to cut their losses below 99.5 as those who attempted to go long the dollar above this level. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a confirming target, 96 on the index is also the 50% mid-point of the prior consolidation, which ranged from 92 to just above 100. When we have two technical targets within 0.5 points of one another, it increases the probability of the range being hit.</span>
<h3><b>Dollar Intermediate-Term</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 95.5 level is an initial downside target only. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have made the case in past issues that the false breakout above 100, which consisted of the entirety of the previous six months of post-Trump action, more importantly constitutes a long-term reversal after a 9-year advance in the USD. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While some level of bounce is expected after the initial 95.5 target is hit, we anticipate further intermediate and long-term downside remains. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, this is a central component of the thesis for a precious metals bull market, as the strongest gains to come in years ahead should arive from a growing world-wide recognition that the world’s present “reserve currency” is a depreciating store of value.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After a bounce at 95.5, our secondary target will be 92 on the dollar index. This level is critically significant for the US currency, as we can see from the 15-year chart below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1937 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/US-Dollar-index-2003-now-1024x609.png" alt="US Dollar index 2003- now" width="840" height="500" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 92 secondary target represents important long-term horizontal support (double black lines), which can be observed from the multiple spikes lower toward that level in 2015 – 2016, and more significantly in the resistance zones which date back to 2004 – 2005 (far left). Further, just below this level, 91.2 represents the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the entire 2008 – 2017 advance (light grey lines).  Again, we have multple technical targets in this 91-92 region, and so the zone will take on important consideration.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The question that remains to be seen is: what sort of bounce will the market take between the initial target of 95.5 and the secondary target of 92? In an impulsive market decline, this sort of initial bounce may not last more than 1-3 months before sustained selling re-emerges.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of the exact legnth of the dollar bounce at 95.5</span><b> any price action that remains below 100.5 on the index will keep the technical criteria for a long-term top valid in the US currency.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A test of the 92 secondary target would thus be anticipated for Q3 – Q4 2017. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A break below 92 would be a strong confirming indicator of a new bear market materializing. Longer-term, we expect that the dollar will eventually make new all-time lows below 72, with the timing for this likely into the mid-years of the forthcoming decade.</span>

  I have been listening to all these comments and the one thing that keeps coming up is the integrity of our news companies, they think that we are all just sitting on the edge of your seats waiting for them to tell us what to think. We all have our own brains to tell us what is right and what is wrong. How anyone can think that one man can change the world is ludicrous. 
  I like Mr. Trump and I believe he will do a good job for us, yes he is rich but I don't hold that against him. I do not believe that being rich automatically makes you a person to watch out for. I admit that having money does make some people think they have the right to do whatever they like but we have a lot of checks and balances so no one person can get away with that kind of thing.
I agree with Miss Conde when she says that the 2% drop is due to the current situation and not by one man.
Thanks

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi! I've been reading this blog for a while, and I'm sorry W. King, but it seems you not have read the article. When media announced the Trump investigation, US Dollar slipped down over 2%. I think you'd agree this is a huge drop in current situation. This article discusses the market reaction to the news and doesn't provide a direct political opinion. There is no judgment or any liberal slant.  We all know that media and different news platform (economic, political, financial etc) have an independent content.
Of cause, we have different visions and can agree or disagree with someone's opinion, but I believe our debates should be reasonable and objective. Your comment seems unrelated to the actual content of the articles and engaging in this kind of debate is a losing policy. Let's respect the author and readers here. If you consider this content is not relevant for you, it doesn't mean it's false.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi
  I am just a simple man, but it seems to me that your implying that Mr. trump
Used some back door techniques to manipulate the markets.
  However, like I said I'm just a simple man how doesn't understand big
words. I am hoping that you could say it in a lay-man's words or in other words with straight talk. First of all I do not understand graphs, they seem to say one thing when in actuality they are saying quite the opposite.
  I voted for Mr. Trump for two reasons, first because I believe that we need a strong hand at the wheel and secondly I believe him to be an honest man but if I'm hearing what I think I'm hearing then maybe I chose wrong.
Thanks for allowing me to chew your ear

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Please remove me from your mailing list. The assertion that a 2% decrease in the dollar is somehow related to President Trump is totally absurd. Any decrease is due to market conditions pure and simple. Asserting that there is any validity to the ludicrous idea of collusion with Russia by President Trump is an outright falsehood generated by progressive left liberals attempting to distract the public from the widespread lawlessness of Hillary Clinton and her associates. There is more solid factual evidence of the Clintons colluding with Russia and none that President Trump did. If your firm wants to blog to promote liberal lies do not expect me to be your customer. The title of your news blog is fake news! There is zero truth in the assertion that Trump devalued the US dollar and he is 100% accurate describing the investigation as a witch hunt. The investigation is unwarranted and a product of the desperate liberal left continuing their war on our Democratic Republic in favor of a socialist open border communist style state. In short, progressive liberals want to destroy our country as we know it! Do not fool yourself into thinking by simply stating you don't want to be political and then blogging false political ideology and untruths you can escape responsibility for your false words. I remain disgusted! I for one believe in American exceptionalism and the concept of our great nation state unlike Bill and Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and so called progressive liberals. Further I am also disgusted that any firm would attempt to make false claims to seek corporate profits even when such claims themselves harm our nation.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Gold &amp; Silver Price Updates</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/05/30/gold-silver-price-updates/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> closed higher by $14 or 1.2% to finish at $1,268 for the week. The precious metal is now close enough to its key long-term 2011-2017 downtrend that we can again call this advance another attempt to overcome the critical level. The last attempt to do so came on April 17 at $1,290 per ounce – a level which was exceeded for a few hours before failing to hold it throughout the overnight trading hours. As the trendline is downward sloping, the level to overcome inherently is falling every week, and we thus shift our focus to the $1,280 level, as shown below by the most recent arrow just above that long-term (magenta color) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trendline.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2004 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Gold-2008-Present-1024x766.png" alt="Gold 2008-Present" width="840" height="628" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have stated in the past that our target upon a successful breakout of the pennant-shaped consolidation will be $330 above or below the apex of the consolidation, which is $1,205: thus, either $1,535 or $875, within 6-12 months of the breaking point. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will have much more analysis on what short-term swings to expect </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">within</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this significant movement once the break of the pattern finally happens. For now, let us continue to focus on the pattern’s resolution itself, and the $1,280 figure that would be required at this juncture.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2005 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2011-2017-Downtrend-1-1024x766.png" alt="2011-2017 Downtrend" width="840" height="628" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most probable scenario we see is that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> again fails to break out this week, and continues to grind in the low-mid $1,200’s through Q3, in what should be the final exhaustive consolidation to wear out the last remnants of the “hot money” that became interested in the sector only after 2016’s first-half surge.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, at our firm we are already largely invested, and that is because in a bull market surprises should be expected to the upside, i.e. a breakout sooner – perhaps by mid-summer – rather than later in the year. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While in the midst of a lengthy consolidation it is difficult to imagine that anything else will ever occur. Frustration grows as the sector oscillates without much definitive movement. This is exactly the time to go against the herd and not succumb to such limited perspective.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The price action that occurs after a consolidation breaks will have little resemblance to the price action within the consolidation itself. This is one of the clearest consolidation patterns we have ever observed in the gold market. Let us remain alert.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The technical action in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> is encouraging for the entire sector. Gold’s cousin rose $0.53 cents or 3.1%, to close at $17.32 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday. Having regained the rising trendline successfully, we can now call the final portion of silver’s plunge into early May below $16.50 a “false breakdown” as can be seen on the chart.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2007 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Silver-oversold-1024x766.png" alt="Silver oversold" width="840" height="628" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is minor resistance at $17.75 which may halt the current advance – although if and when gold breaks its primary consolidation, silver should rise with strength such that it may simply ignore most of the previous short-term resistance levels that are visible on the chart above. On a successful gold breakout, momentum indicators and/or leading signals from the silver mining complex will be more important for gauging the next target of an intermediate high.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To the downside, we would see a break of support at $15.75 as a major red flag that the expected bull market advance may be delayed beyond 2018.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Longer-term, however, the clarity of silver’s basing pattern could not be more apparent. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver prices</a> are now beginning their fifth year below the $25/oz region. Downward momentum is largely exhausted after the 73% drop from 2011 – 2015. The longer that prices remain in this basing pattern, the stronger that the move higher will eventually be once $25 is breached. We must remember that at each swing higher and lower within a basing pattern, metal is being transferred from weak hands to strong.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our general expectation is that silver may continue with this basing process with an upward bias through mid-2018.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2008 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Silver-2011-2017-1-1024x925.png" alt="Silver 2011-2017" width="840" height="759" />

		<title>The US Bond Market – the 800-Pound Gorilla</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The “800-pound gorilla” in the investment world is not the US stock market, nor yet the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> market – it is the US treasury bond market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US bond market, at over $40 trillion in value, is much larger than the US stock market, which comes in at a little over $25 trillion. The longest-dated component of the US treasury market is the 30-year bond.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The chart below shows the price of the US 30-year bond from 1980 through the present. Readers should recall that interest rates move inversely to price – so as the price has been rising steadily for the past 36 years, interest rates have been falling this entire time, to a generational low of 2.1% last summer.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2079 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/US-30-Year-Bond-Price-1024x609.png" alt="US 30-Year Bond Price" width="578" height="344" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we can see, investors have had an insatiable appetite for US debt over the past 36 years. We here see a market which was following a long-term orderly rising channel, which then started to take on characteristics of a mania from 2015 – 2016. During these recent years, bond prices began a parabolic curve higher (blue callout), corresponding to a willingness by investors to accept negative real returns for the privilege of holding US debt. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The textbook footprint of a mania on a chart is a long-term orderly market breaking higher into a parabolic curve. This is exactly what was witnessed from 2014 through mid-2016 in the longest-dated US bond.</span>
<h3><b>Parabolic Curve Broken</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The parabolic curve was then broken in last summer’s decline in bond prices, indicating a long-term top was put into place. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet bonds are once again in the media for having had several positive months in a row, as we can see below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2080 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Treasury-Bond-Price.png" alt="Treasury Bond Price" width="704" height="468" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If our analysis is correct, </span><b>any rally in bond prices from this point onward should be counter-trend in nature only</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Last summer’s highs at 175 should not be regained for bond prices. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will have strong confirmation within the next six months if bond prices make a new low below 145. Much stronger confirmation will come from a breakdown below the lower rising channel line (magenta color) near 135, which would be expected at any time within the next 12-36 months.</span>
<h3><b>Bond Market Critical to US &amp; Western Standard of Living</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The one backdrop which most investors alive today have known is rising bond prices and the corresponding falling interest rates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us assume that the average American begins to follow the financial markets and to consider investing at age 22. This means that anyone born after 1958 knows only falling interest rates as a broad macroeconomic backdrop.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every political and technological advance that has happened in the US and allied western nations since 1980 has occurred amidst falling interest rates and ever-cheaper credit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, total debt in the United States exceeded gross domestic product for the first time in 2011, a trend which does not appear to be improving:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2081 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FRED-1024x342.png" alt="FRED" width="840" height="281" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This imbalance can only happen amidst a backdrop of investors willing to ever finance US debt by continuously purchasing US-bonds. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet on the 36-year chart above, we show what appears to be the key characteristics of a market in the process of putting in a long-term top.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How will the United States finance this debt amidst a rising interest rate backdrop? The interest expense for federal debt alone in 2016 was $432 billion. Can we imagine if interest rates double just too historic norms that existed ten years ago? With the addition of record new debt this year, the annual interest rate expense alone could easily exceed $1 trillion within the next 3 years.</span>

<b>How will the United States fund an interest expense growing exponentially if the bond market has put in a long-term top?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, no politician wins re-election in a democracy by cutting funding to constituents.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No one stays in office for long by cutting benefits to the sick, the elderly, the poor, veterans, schools, or for infrastructure. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, the solution to the funding gap is: the Federal Reserve will be forced to print money.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The central bank will be forced to create sufficient money to “monetize” US bonds to cover whatever cannot be raised by taxes alone.</span>
<h3><b>Monetization of Debt is Inflation</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Monetization is the direct creation of new money to finance debt – and it will represent a hidden tax on those least able to afford it, namely the poor and middle-class on fixed incomes. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When inflation drives up the prices of necessities such as food and shelter, these classes have no means to protect themselves, as they are forced to buy those items no matter the cost. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, those with disposable income can protect themselves and even benefit from periods of inflation if they invest properly by owning real assets. For this reason, inflation is a regressive tax, in that it steals quality of life from the poor and gives to the rich.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the policy of most Western governments and central banks today.</span>
<h3><b>Back to the Bond Market</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, we come back to the bond market. The theoretical fundamentals of a declining bond market have been hypothesized by various writers for many decades… yet it is only now that we are seeing actual topping signals on the chart itself.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it possible that the parabolic curve seen on the chart above was simply a warmup for an even more manic final blow-off to come? Ultimately anything is possible in the markets. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But if that is going to happen, we will see it on the chart very soon, as bond prices should explode higher and clearly exceed the 175 level for 6-18 months before they come crashing down. Fundamentally, this could only correspond with real interest rates plunging into the negative 2-3% range, as investors would “pay” the government for the privilege of loaning money to them.</span>

<b>Our best assessment is that the top has already occurred. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A parabolic curve in the largest bond market in the world that exceeded the 36-year rising channel has already broken down. It would be rare to see this curve regained again.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> investors, this market bears our foremost attention over the next year. We should be able to plainly see a breakdown of the long-term rising channel on the chart when it occurs. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This will be a sign of a multi-decade top in no uncertain terms. Decades of rising interest rates should follow… and amidst a backdrop of a government caught between a rock (unfunded debt) and a hard place (printing money), we know that in the fiat era a government will always choose the later.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term thesis for protection by precious metals ownership is thus still in its infancy. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The failed breakout and reversal back below the long-term declining trendline at $1,280 for gold this past week is a negative development for the entire precious metals complex. From a technical standpoint, it is exactly what we did not want to see as far as a market ready for a major advance.

Even so, we must quantify the nature of a false breakout. Those failed moves that happen at the end of multi-year or multi-decade advances (as we have recently seen in the US dollar) tend to be leading signals of long-term trend reversals. The <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold market</a> at $1,280 per ounce is nowhere near the all-time high from 2011 at $1,923. So inherently this failed advance cannot carry the same weight as a long-term top.

Still, the reversal could carry the consequence of a significant intermediate-term decline. By failing to sustain the advance above this same trendline once again, gold remains in a negative posture for the time being, until proven otherwise.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2116" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/a_gold-2011-2017-downtrend.png" alt="gold-2011-2017-downtrend" width="1099" height="823" />

&nbsp;

For the week as a sum, gold fell 0.9% or $12 to close at $1,266 as of the final trade in the electronic access market in New York on Friday afternoon.

Gold’s next initial support comes in at $1,230, which is the rising (dashed) trendline visible on the chart from the January low.
<h2><strong>Beware Early Celebrators</strong></h2>
We have been making the case over the last year that many technical-based traders would be waiting for this pending breakout signal to begin buying, as clear long-term trendlines are visible to many who follow such charts.

However, on Tuesday when we first saw the breakout attempt, we noted the necessity for the advance to <u>hold</u> the $1,280 level at least through this week’s Fed meeting on Wednesday. Also on Tuesday, we observed many premature celebrations throughout the investment world regarding gold’s breakout.

Long-term breakouts must have both conviction and sustaining power. From a contrarian standpoint, the lack of caution by so many investors, including mainstream media outlets such as Bloomberg and well-known commodity analysts, was a bearish setup for the sharp reversal seen the following day. Below are just a few samples:

<strong> </strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2117" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/b_gold-long-term-breakouts-yearly.png" alt="Long-term breakouts" width="942" height="791" />
<h2><strong>Gold’s Next Support</strong></h2>
The consolidation pattern continues to get tighter, and a big move is coming in one direction or the other. Gold could still find support above $1,230 and then stage a legitimate breakout in July or early August. But a failure at the $1,230 rising support would trigger a short-term topping formation, which would target $1,140 initially, and open the door to a retest of the 2015 bottom at $1,045.

We do not want to get too far ahead of ourselves at this juncture, except to say that gold remains in an inherently neutral consolidation following this false breakout. The bearish resolution would result in either a retest of the 2015 bottom at $1,045 or even a new low, while the bullish resolution would result in a significant leg higher across the entire <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com">precious metals</a> complex targeting $1,535 within 6-12 months. Fundamental drivers will be causing these moves, but we will be able to observe the signals on the charts before any attributable news is announced publicly.

It is not easy to stay involved at the beginning of a suspected bull market for a reason – whiplash is the term for the price action we are observing and the unease it causes investors.

Was the entirety of the gain in 2016 just a big false start, before <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> heads for a new low? We cannot know until the above pattern is resolved.

The bottom line is short-term risk has grown based on the this week’s failure. However, the book is not yet written.
<h2><strong>Fed Meeting On Tap</strong></h2>
This Wednesday is the Federal Reserve interest rate meeting, where the Fed is expected to raise rates for the fourth time since December 2015.

Expect lower volatility trading on Monday and Tuesday, with high volatility immediately after the meeting announcement at 2pm, especially if the markets are at all surprised by the Fed decision. For reference, the market is expecting a single rate hike, with language hinting of a further 0.25% hike to come either in July or September, so anything other than this outcome could cause a high-volatility reaction through the rest of the week.

Next week we will examine the Fed policy statement and the impact it has on the precious metals.

		<title>Fed Rate Hike and Gold</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/06/19/fed-rate-hike-and-gold/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve increased short-term interest rates on Wednesday by 0.25%, the fourth rate hike of the current cycle which began in December 2015. Short-term rates now stand at 1.00% - 1.25%, which are still generally - low levels, yet now a full point higher than they were 18-months ago.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The key from the Fed meeting on Wednesday was not simply the interest rate decision, but the language given in the accompanying statement regarding a potential reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet: “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Committee currently expects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated. This program… would gradually reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings by decreasing reinvestment of principal payments from those securities.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall that an expansion of the balance sheet is a euphemism for printing money, which is inflation. Thus, a normalization would imply a reduction in the money supply and a reduction in inflation.</span>
<h3><b>Will the Fed Normalize?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are extremely skeptical that the Fed will engage in any meaningful reduction in its balance sheet, mostly due to the central bank’s horrible record in doing so at any point in the past. Below is the Fed’s balance sheet over the last 15 years. Indeed, it is rare that the bank stops printing money for more than a few quarters at a time, its balance sheet having grown by nearly 500% during this time: </span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2138 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FRED-1-1024x394.png" alt="All Federal Reserve Banks" width="840" height="323" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking forward, a survey of Fed board members is now pricing in either 0-1 additional rate hikes in 2017, followed by 3-4 hikes in 2018, followed by 2 further hikes in 2019, as shown in the graph below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2139 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FOMC-Member-Forecasts.png" alt="FED Member Forecasts" width="505" height="353" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold price</a> fell sharply following the Fed meeting, giving up $20 on Wednesday afternoon, not so much because of the rate increase, but because of the language regarding balance sheet normalization.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether or not the Federal Reserve will actually reduce its balance sheet, the market believes that it will, and over the short run, this is seen as gold-negative.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the week in sum, gold ended lower by $15 or 1.2% to close at $1,254 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Viewed in isolation, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> remains in its neutral consolidation pattern. Short-term support should exist at $1,230 (rising dashed trendline), and the nature of any rebound that occurs at this level will tell us much about what to expect over the remainder of the year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The more critical 2015 – 2017 support (blue line) – which is rising every week – now comes in at $1,160.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2140 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2011-2017-Downtrend-1024x767.png" alt="2011-2017 Downtrend" width="557" height="417" />
<h3><b>Gold Has Formed Higher Lows on Successive Rate Hikes</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast to the theory often purported in the mainstream media that rising interest rates are negative for gold, the precious metal has formed a series of higher lows within one week of each of the Fed rate hike announcements, shown below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2141 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Gold.png" alt="Gold " width="1145" height="499" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Will last week’s announcement thus mark a fourth higher low forming in gold again? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Time will tell.</span>

		<title>Gold vs. Commodities</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have seen weakness in the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> over the past two weeks, and if gold fails to break higher from its ongoing consolidation over the next 3-6 months, a significant culprit will selling amongst broad-based commodity funds. Below we zoom in on a detail of the CRB Commodity Index, which gold measures an average price level of 19 commodities including <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/coins">silver</a>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum/coins">platinum</a>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium/coins">palladium</a>, the industrial metals, the energy complex, and agricultural products.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that the CRB index has recently broken below its 15-month support zone between 176 – 179, which had held since April 2016.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2174 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CRB-1024x767.png" alt="CRB Commodity" width="840" height="629" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our technical target for the CRB over the short run is 158 on the index – in other words, a retest of the 2016 lows. This target is calculated by subtracting the amplitude of the failed advance above the support zone (19) from the breakdown point (177). Fundamentally, it represents an equal number of long contract holders who are likely to liquidate below the breakdown point as who bought above the support zone over the past year.</span>
<h3><b>Gold Sometimes Grouped with Other Commodities</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although gold is certainly not simply another commodity like the rest of the CRB index, during times in which investor psychology is preoccupied with “hot” markets such as technology stocks (Amazon, Facebook, etc.), real estate, and crypto-currencies, sentiment tends to fade against all commodities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We might disagree with the market fundamentally, i.e. we know currency debasement and unsustainable debt continues to increase every day, but a key point of our philosophy is to put our own fundamental opinion second, and to respect the market first.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At present, the market is seeing less of a need for safety due to a focus on hot risky asset classes, and so that component of gold demand is absent. We are thus witnessing gold and silver have a high correlation with the rest of the commodity complex. In such an environment, when institutional funds place sells orders for their diversified commodity holdings, gold is dumped in tandem with the group.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, gold has been outpacing the rest of the commodity complex since the late 2015 lows. However, such relative strength is not always sufficient to stop precious metals from falling in a general commodity liquidation over the short run. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If we see gold break down below $1,230, a key short-term support level, a continued decline in the CRB index will be a major contributing factor.</span>
<h3><b>Commodity Index Long-Term</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we back out the chart for the CRB index from 1974 – 2017:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2175 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CRB-Commodity.png" alt="CRB Commodity" width="1019" height="763" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be noted that </span><b>broad <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/02/06/gold-silver-commodities/">commodities</a> are now the cheapest they have been in 43 years nominally</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and by far the cheapest in real terms (adjusted for inflation). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The low of 2016 is in the process of being retested, which is what may lead to near-term weakness in gold – but in viewing the chart above we must seriously ask the question: how much lower can commodities fall from 43-year lows?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are tangible materials of finite supply in the earth’s crust, which the ever-growing world population consumes every day – a reality that will not change in our lifetimes unless technology to harvest minerals from asteroids arrives soon, a scenario still the realm of science fiction works.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The CRB Commodity Index cannot go to zero as a currency or individual stock can, yet this is the lowest that commodities have been in four decades. <b>When things that cannot go to zero are priced at their lowest in over a generation, we must view the relative risk/reward proposition as favorable from a long-term perspective.</b> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our assessment is that even if moderate weakness continues for several months to 1-2 years, broad commodities are much closer to a long-term bottom than a top. <img class="alignright wp-image-2176 size-medium" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Cycle-300x155.png" alt="The relative risk" width="300" height="155" /></span>

<b>Commodity Cycles</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Commodities are cyclical in nature. The chart at right shows the three major cycles that the commodity complex has seen since the 1970’s, divided into two sub-phases each of boom and bust cycles (green and red shading, respectively). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Booms and busts are an inherent feature of the typical 10-20 year delay that it takes for the mining lifecycle to move from:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a) mineral discovery through </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(b) mine permitting to </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(c) construction to </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(d) successful production which then</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(e) increases supply in the market. </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is said that in commodities “low prices are the solution for low prices”, as marginal mine supply is eliminated when prices fall, eventually forcing prices higher again. We are seeing this phenomenon already in many junior oil and precious metals companies: deposits which were once economic are no longer at today’s low commodity prices, and thus the mines are placed on care and maintenance, reducing supply until higher prices emerge.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Commodities in Relation to Gold</b></h3>
Even if weakness continues in the commodity complex through the remainder of this year, our assessment is that most commodities are much closer to long-term bottoms than long-term tops. Of course, each commodity will move at different times and with a different set of fundamentals. Yet the macro analysis shows a world preoccupied at the moment with the bull markets in digital technology – but as day must follow night, higher commodity prices must follow a period of lower prices. Gold selling due to broad commodity weakness is thus limited in the big picture, even if weakness over the short run cannot be ruled out.

		<title>Gold – A Large Move is Approaching</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">On a semi-regular basis, we find it helpful to revisit the longer-term perspective for the precious metals, so that short-term price action does not dominate our focus. This will be important shortly as, despite what may seem like a volatile market over the past few months, </span><b>we have reason to believe that the volatility in the gold market is set to increase massively throughout the second half of 2017 and into 2018</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> is in the process of forming a long-term bottom, but the challenge is that long-term bottoms often feature prices which can see a series of retests and/or nominal new lows throughout a multi-year basing period. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 20-year <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold chart</a> below, we see a confluence of four major technical support levels between the $850/ounce and $1,045/ounce levels. Whenever there is a confluence of technical targets within a certain price band, it represents a high-confidence level for a major low to form. While the following zone is too wide for short-term traders, it should give a reliable long-term support target for investors with a multi-year time horizon.</span>

<strong> The levels are labeled below:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2008 – 2015 horizontal support at $1,045.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term rising linear trendline which started in 2001, now at $900.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the entire 2000 – 2011 advance, which comes at $890.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former 1980 all-time closing high, which comes at $850.</span></li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2200 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Gold-2008-2015-P1.png" alt="Gold 2008-2015 P1" width="1125" height="495" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains possible that the absolute low for gold was formed in December 2015 at $1,045, but the likelihood of a retest of that level and/or nominal new lows is still significant. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A break of gold’s long-term declining 2011 – 2017 downtrend would give us increased confidence that the absolute low has already been formed, but this key <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/04/17/gold-breakout-approaching/">technical breakout</a> has remained elusive despite multiple attempts over the previous year.</span>
<h3><b>Gold Short-Term</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Zooming into the 18-month view, gold is extremely “tight” on the short-term chart, caught between its falling long-term downtrend (magenta) and its short-term rising trend from January (dashed teal color). These two trends are converging within the next six weeks, and when this happens one must necessarily break. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The immediate area of concern is highlighted below in green:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2201 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Gold-2011-2017-Downtrend-P2-1024x767.png" alt="Gold 2011-2017 Downtrend P2" width="840" height="629" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A break lower from this short-term green triangle opens up an initial decline to the $1,160 level in Q3, corresponding with the rising blue trend forming the lower boundary of the pennant-shaped consolidation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a break higher would be an important signal of a market set to start a new multi-year advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We truly are approaching a crossroads for the precious metal on the short-term chart.</span>

<b>Volatility Confirms Significant Move Ahead</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That a large price move is coming for gold can also be seen by examining volatility. Below is an index which trades on the Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE), which tracks the daily volatility of gold futures contracts. The index is shown since 2010:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2202 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GVZ-Gold-Volatility-P3.png" alt="GVZ Gold Volatility P3" width="878" height="437" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we can see, gold volatility is now at 8-year lows. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility is inherently a neutral market expression – in other words when volatility is low, it only tells us that a period of higher volatility is set to follow. However, it does not tell us in which direction the strong movement will occur.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The CBOE volatility index is confirming that either a surge or a significant decline is to come in gold, depending on which direction the consolidation breaks.</span>
<h3><b>How Would This Look on the Long-Term Chart?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term chart on page 1 is now stripped of its annotations so that we can envision how either a breakout higher or lower – as predicted by both our technical analysis and the record low volatility of present –  would manifest in the market:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2203 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Confluence-of-Support-Levels-Bottom-Zone-1024x451.png" alt="Confluence of Support Levels -Bottom Zone" width="840" height="370" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical analysis is about identifying high probability scenarios based on observable trends in the marketplace. It is no crystal ball, but it does help establish reasonable expectations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again: the breakout either higher or lower must begin by Q3 – Q4. This is based on the convergence of the pennant consolidation visible in the 18-month gold chart.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout higher should see an initial advance to target 2016 highs near $1,375 per ounce, followed by a modest retracement, en route to the $1,535 in 2018.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a break lower should see a rapid plunge to retest 2015 lows at $1,045, followed by a modest recovery, which would then open up the possibility of new lows within the green support band below $1,000.</span>
<h3><b>Worst Case Scenario</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We maintain that even the worst-case scenario of a drop below $1,000 will represent part of a larger multi-year bottoming process – and so: </span><b>how one should consider preparing is largely dependent on one’s individual time the horizon and risk tolerance.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those with shorter-term time horizons should be cautioned that if new lows formed, it could take gold several more years of basing to regain its upward trajectory. Yet accumulation throughout any final plunge would be a healthy plan for those looking to accumulate holdings as part of a long-term strategy.</span>

		<title>Silver’s Flash Crash</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/10/silvers-flash-crash/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> saw a “flash crash” on Thursday night EST / Friday morning in Asia, falling momentarily by at least $1.50 before recovering somewhat during the day.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The actual low print is up to some debate, depending on which exchange and contract one refer to the low bid for the spot market (shown below) according to our trading desk was $14.16, while some other platforms are showing the low as $14.50.<img class="alignright wp-image-2229 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Flash-crash.png" alt="Silver &quot;Flash, crash&quot;" width="579" height="448" /> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will be conservative and call the low $14.16. Either way, clearly the exchanges were overwhelmed with whoever decided to sell such a quantity of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> in such a short period.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many futures traders were stopped out at significant losses during the "flash crash". However, as discussed in recent articles, we have been monitoring negative leading signals in both the CRB commodity index and the gold/silver ratio for the past month, and so we were largely expecting the recent drops in metals prices.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Several analysts are calling this "flash crash" the final bottom for silver’s recent decline: they are likely premature in these calls. It is important to understand what happens during a "flash crash": someone dumps a huge amount of paper silver on the market at a single instant. Stops are taken out, and selling begets further selling as traders panic to avoid losses. The selling only stops when a significantly large entity – who is using lower leverage and thus does not run the risk of being stopped out by the waterfall decline – steps in with a sufficiently-large bid to absorb all the panic selling.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is: we now know where large entities are willing to buy silver. That figure is down near $14.16 or slightly above.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bad news is: that level is likely to be retested at least once, if not on multiple occasions over the next 3-6 months. In a worst-case scenario, the large bidder will be exhausted (though he will have absorbed most of the sellers), and a final low will occur marginally below the bidder’s established price ($14.16 at the lower range).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, we have here, in this flash crash, a strong piece of evidence to suggest that the low for silver’s current decline will occur in the low-to-mid $14 range. We will, of course, use other forms of technical analysis to zero in on this low as it approaches.</span>
<h3><b>On Manipulation</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a final note on silver: yes, we would consider this type of selling to be “manipulation” of the markets, by some entity. However, our goal is to be pragmatic: such manipulation is going to occur periodically in silver, so let us at least protect ourselves and possibly profit from these occasions, as opposed to standing by as mere victims as many commentators seem content to do in the precious metals world. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the long run, silver will eventually be moving higher.</span>
<h3><b>Silver Intermediate Outlook</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning to the silver chart itself, for the week gold’s cousin fell $1.20 or 7.2%, to close at $15.43 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.  The technical damage is reflected on the near-term chart and outlook:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2230 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Primary-resistance.png" alt="Silver technical damage" width="586" height="529" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our view is that, in percentage terms, the majority of silver’s decline is already behind us. A final drop to the low $14’s or mid $13’s would not constitute a significant further percentage drop – but it would sufficiently harm investor sentiment such that a functional retest of 2015 lows could mark the most important buying opportunity for the remainder of the decade.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The advance that occurs following a double-bottom scenario of the $13 - $14 region (equivalent to the 2015 lows) should be just as strong as the surge that began in first-half 2016… so let us remain prepared.</span>

		<title>Gold Technical Update</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week we noted that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver </a>had broken its year-long support zone between $15.75 - $16.15 during the prior week’s <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/10/silvers-flash-crash/">flash crash</a>. What does this apparent breakdown mean for gold? Let us update the technical perspective for gold for the short and intermediate timeframes:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2258" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Gold-for-the-short-and-intermediate-timeframes.png" alt="Gold for the short and intermediate time frames" width="1058" height="792" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the week as a sum, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> rose 1.5% or $18 to close at $1,227 as of the final trade in New York on Friday afternoon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks ago, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> broke short-term rising support at $1,232 (turquoise line, above). This trendline was rising, and we must recall that retests of rising trendlines can indeed occur at a different (in this case higher) price level than the original breakdown point.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, our best assessment is that gold is set to move moderately higher for the remainder of July and into August below its broken short-term support. This means that gold should continue moderately higher for the next 4-6 weeks below $1,250. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect gold will not regain its broken (turquoise color) trendline yet, and so the precious metal should then begin to turn lower again by late August, toward a test of its lower (blue) boundary of the pennant consolidation. This level now comes in at $1,175 and is rising by the day.</span>
<h3><b>On a Gold Recapture of Broken Trendline</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If gold were to negate its recent breakdown and recapture $1,250, the convergence of this short-term (turquoise) trend and the long-term (magenta color) 2011-2017 downtrend would occur at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly the same price level</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by late-August: $1,250. So, it would be one of the clearest technical signals we could ask for to indicate a new strong rising trend had begun, as both a breakout from a short-term and long-term resistance level simultaneously. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Officially, there are 5.5 months left before the giant pennant-shaped consolidation shown above must resolve in one direction or another. This would be quite literally at the end of the calendar year in December, visible at the far right of the chart above. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the vast majority of historic examples, these patterns will resolve several months before the actual apex occurs. The August – October timeframe is our best estimation, as for confirmation to whether we will have a legitimate bull market on our hands or the beginning of a decline to new lows perhaps below the 2015 bottoms. There will be opportunities to profit and/or protect ourselves in either scenario, but we must get the primary direction correct first. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, short-term traders are cautioned that </span><b>whiplash is likely</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as gold is officially “trendless” – having broken both its short-term downtrend since June and its intermediate rising trend from January lows – all within the confines of the much larger consolidation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect volatility to begin lessening and for gold to appear almost comatose during the last several weeks immediately prior to either a breakdown or breakout in the August – October timeframe.</span>
<h3><b>Investment Considerations</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">How one chooses to position prior to the resolution of gold’s giant consolidation pattern is largely a factor of personal goals, time horizons, and risk tolerance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, an investor on a long-term accumulation plan, who is investing 10% - 20% of his/her assets into gold as either long-term savings or a “wealth insurance” policy, would likely welcome a period of lower prices should they manifest. After all, buying an asset for lower prices over the short-run can lead to a lower dollar-cost average price for the long-term holding.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, those with a shorter-term time horizon might choose to pay closer attention to the resolution of the chart pattern shown above. If the pattern resolves higher, gold is calculated to see a surge of $200 - $300 within the following 12 months. However, if the pattern resolves lower, an equally large decline is what the target calls for. These might sound like two extreme scenarios – yet these are exactly the types of moves that are predicted from the resolution of converging consolidation patterns.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are now in the terminal last months of gold’s consolidation. Readers should not assume that gold will remain so quiet going forward as it has over the past year. Please stay tuned as we zero in on leading indicators over the next few months which should help us gain insight into gold’s coming resolution in one direction or the other.  </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> have recovered moderately over the past two weeks, yet still remain within the confines of the ongoing consolidations we have been monitoring over the last several months. For the week, gold rose 2.2% or $27 to close at $1,255 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile, silver posted a gain of 3.3% or $0.52 cents, to close at $16.46. Over the short run, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver's</a> recovery and close on a weekly basis above the key $16 level is certainly a positive sign that buyers remain ready to step in anytime the price drops into the $15’s.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is periodically beneficial to focus not only on gold and silver themselves in isolation but to examine the ratio between the two metals. In other words, we are referring to the number of ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a backdrop, readers should know that in general throughout history, a falling gold to silver ratio has tended to correspond with rising prices in both precious metals, whereas a rising gold to silver ratio has tended to correspond with falling prices in the metals. Of course, there are exceptions to every rule, but this is the prevailing trend that we observe when examining the ratio throughout history.</span>
<h3><b>Why does a falling gold to silver ratio correspond with rising gold and silver prices?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several reasons for this phenomenon. First, the silver market is extremely small compared to the gold market. For example, in 2016 just over 1 billion ounces of silver were produced from mining and scrap supply. Yet of this, approximately 80% or 800 million ounces were used for industrial fabrication: a combination of jewelry, silverware, electronics, solar panels, and photography. This silver was essentially “consumed” by industry or permanently taken off the market. What this means is that in 2016, only 200 million ounces were available for investment demand.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the industry has consumed the majority of silver for several decades, it is estimated that only 2-3 billion ounces exist above ground in readily investible form, meaning coins and bars. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare this to gold, in which the industrial demand is tiny in that only 16% of the 128 million ounces purchased in 2016 were used for fabrication. Of course, this means that 84% of the gold produced in 2016 is still available to the market in one form or another.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taken as a sum, we can see that in dollar terms, the total physical silver available in investible form pales in comparison to the total quantity of gold available. Most of the silver brought to market has been consumed by industry over the last 50 years. Not so with gold.</span>
<h3><b>What Happens in a Rising Gold Price Environment?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the much greater quantity of gold than silver that exists above ground for investment purposes, we must consider what happens in a rising precious metals price environment. Gold prices initially begin to rise due to purchases from larger players: central banks, institutions, sovereign wealth funds, and some forward-looking individuals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the rare exception (Warren Buffet bought 130 million ounces in 1998), silver is generally not the target of the central bank or institutional demand. Yet, importantly, silver is the target of individual investor demand. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The real power in the silver market lies in the potential for it to become the primary target for the individual investor. In a rising metals price backdrop, there will come a point when the average person does not have the resources available to purchase an ounce of gold. Where will he turn?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout history, the answer is silver.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine that an investor desires to move $10,000 into precious metals and that he chooses to split this investment evenly at 50% gold and 50% silver. With that split at today’s prices, he will just barely purchase 4 ounces of gold, yet over 300 ounces of silver (ignoring premiums). Again, let us remember that despite their vastly different values, there is more physical gold available above ground than silver. So here, by splitting a purchase evenly between the two metals, a single investor has taken possession of a much greater quantity of the world’s investable silver than of that for gold.</span>
<h3><b>What if 10% of the Population Wanted to Buy 10 Ounces of Silver?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now consider a scenario for the future, that as gold exceeds $1,500 in the years ahead, the average investor is largely priced out of the gold market. Again, where will he turn?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If 10% of the United States’ 320 million citizens each wanted to purchase 10 ounces of silver, the entire available investment supply for the year would be wiped out. What if 10% of the world’s 7.5 billion people each wanted to own 10 ounces? </span>
<h3><b>Returning to the Gold to Silver Ratio</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential for the precious metals, and especially silver, is significant over the years to come. While the ongoing corrections could continue for some time further, investors should carefully consider the underlying supply and demand fundamentals for the precious metals which will eventually exert themselves. In a rising gold price environment, silver will often lag initially, but when it does begin to gain interest from the average investor, even a modest inflow of capital into the “lesser” metal will have an oversized effect on its price. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We close with a long-term look at the gold to silver ratio. Currently, at 76 ounces of silver to purchase one ounce of gold, at the last precious metals peak in 1980, this ratio hit 17. As we can see, there have been several multi-year uptrends in favor of gold, amidst what appears to be a generational decline in the ratio (in favor of silver). Our expectation is that by the time the current cycle ends, the ratio will once again reach levels last seen in 1980.</span>

		<title>US Dollar Approaching Critical Support</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/31/us-dollar-approaching-critical-support/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important for precious metals investors to follow the valuation of the US dollar versus other foreign currencies because as a general principle, being the world’s reserve currency still to this day, when the dollar sees periods of rapid decline investors tend to seek safety… and some of that safety flow will move into precious metals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we chart the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies including the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, and the Canadian dollar. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the false breakout at multi-decade highs last January, the US dollar has declined with such ferocious momentum that it has surprised even our initial outlook from this past spring. Our initial target to the downside was 95.5 (green callout) and this level has not only been hit but exceeded. In the wake of a dovish indication from the Federal Reserve last week that it may not desire to “normalize” its balance sheet as quickly as many assumed, the USD has continued to plummet all the way down to the nearly 3-year “Critical Support Zone” labeled below in black. This zone extends from 91.9 to 93.1 on the dollar index.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2312 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/US-Dollar-Index.png" alt="US Dollar Index" width="830" height="491" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having closed at 93.1 for the week, the dollar is now effectively testing this critical support zone.</span>
<h3><b>Dollar Set for a Technical Bounce</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the short term, we would expect the dollar to bounce in this region. </span><b>The nature of the bounce will be important to monitor.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The false breakout pattern at a multi-decade high is a rare and significant technical signal for a possible long-term reversal, and so we expect that a bounce from current levels for the dollar will not be anything more than a relief rally, not to exceed the declining (dashed blue) downtrend line. This scenario is highlighted in green.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A less probable scenario would be that the dollar stages a more significant relief rally which breaks its new downtrend, but which does not exceed the resistance zone between 99.5 – 100.5.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The strength of the expected bounce will tell us much about the dollar going forward. Should the dollar stage a larger rally, it will be signaling that the decline we expect over the coming years will be slower and more grinding in nature, perhaps taking an equal 8-years to fall to all-time lows near 72 on the index, levels last seen in 2008.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, should the dollar merely show a weak bounce, staying below its new trendline, not exceeding 95.5 on the way higher and then plunging through the critical support zone, the stage will be set for a more immediate and precipitous drop in the US currency over just the next 12 months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Take, for example, the period to the far left of the chart from mid-2014 to early-2015, in which the dollar rose from 80 to 100.5 within eight months. It is entirely conceivable that in a precipitous dollar decline, the greenback could return just as quickly to the 79-80 region over a similar time frame. This would equate to nearly a 15% further drop in just a year.</span>
<h3><b>Long-Term Dollar Indicator</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider our monthly momentum indicator for the dollar, dating back to the mid-1980’s. According to this model, </span><b>the top just seen in the dollar was the most significant of the past 30 years, </b><b>registering an even more overbought reading than the 2001-2003 top</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For reference, recall that the decline which began in the dollar in 2001 at 118 on the index coincided with the all-time low in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> at $255 per ounce.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2313 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/US-Dollar-Index-Monthly.png" alt="US Dollar Index Monthly" width="1047" height="736" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider, too, that the decline which followed the 2001 top resulted in over a 40% loss in the value of the dollar in just six years. Were such a percentage decline to occur again from this greater-magnitude signal, the target would be 62 on the index by 2023, or of the Y-axis below the chart. </span>
<h3><b>Metals Have Not Responded to USD Weakness… Yet</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, what remains to be seen is: when do <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> begin to respond to the dollar’s decline? From 2003 – 2008, there was a strong day-to-day inverse correlation between the dollar and gold. Recently, however, precious metals traders have been largely ignoring the bulk of the decline in the US dollar up to this point.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When will traders begin to notice the decline in the world’s reserve currency? We cannot say for certain, but we will begin to pick up the change in behavior when it registers on the charts, as we should begin to see $10 - $20 spikes in gold on specific days when the dollar falls by 0.5% - 1.0% on the index.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whichever form the pending bounce takes will tell us much about the strength or lack thereof for the dollar to be expected over the next several years.</span>

		<title>Are Gold and the Japanese Yen Equal? (Part I)</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In past articles, we have discussed the generally-antagonistic relationship between <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold </a>and the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/31/us-dollar-approaching-critical-support/">US dollar</a>. Still to this day the world’s reserve currency, as precious metals investors we must always keep a close eye on the value of the dollar, as gold stands to be a primary beneficiary if in fact the dollar ever loses a significant amount of value in the future.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the value of the dollar versus all foreign currencies must regularly be considered, there is one cross-pair that deserves special attention for its relationship with gold. And that is the dollar versus the Japanese yen. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise labeled “JPY/USD”, we are hereby referring to the value of the Japanese yen as priced in US dollars. How is JPY/USD related to gold?</span>
<h3><b>JPY/USD and Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The clearest way to show the importance of the JPY/USD cross-pair and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is to plot a direct comparison between the two. Below we show JPY/USD (multiplied by 100 for scale) on top, with the price of gold immediately below, since the 2011 peak in gold at $1,923 per ounce:</span>

<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2353" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Japanese-Yen_comparison.png" alt="Japanese Yen_comparison" width="531" height="549" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The similarity between these two charts is striking. For example, note how the absolute highs for both gold at $1,923 per ounce and for JPY/USD at 1.32 occurred in Q3 2011. Note too how the large drop in gold which occurred between October 2012 and June 2013 when the metal fell from $1,800 down to $1,175 coincided precisely with the JPY/USD decline from 1.30 down to 0.98. Both continued to bring lower until 2015.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both assets also surged simultaneously during the first half of 2016, only to give back much of those gains in tandem during the second half of the year.</span>
<h3><b>Ratio Plot</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to view the relationship between these two assets is in the form of a ratio. Below we plot JPY/USD divided by the price of gold, since 1998. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In plain English, this ratio asks: “How does the value of the Japanese yen compare to the value of gold?”</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2354" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Japanese-Gold-ratio.png" alt="Japanese ,Gold ratio" width="1144" height="588" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see that over time the graph has moved lower. This means that over the past two decades the Japanese yen has lost considerable value versus gold; in other words, gold has risen as priced in yen. This should generally be expected, as we know all fiat currencies are being debased by their respective central banks over time.</span>
<h3><b>The Yen / Gold Correlation</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">What is perhaps not so expected is to see the tight correlation since late-2011 that has developed between the Japanese yen and the price of gold.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This correlation can be seen on the lower right corner of the chart via the blue converging trendlines, with the nearly flat price action since 2011.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When a ratio such as this flat lines, it tells us that the two components are highly positively correlated: the two assets are moving closely in tandem. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this instance, the flat line in the ratio confirms that the Japanese yen to US dollar cross pair is behaving nearly identically to the price of gold. In other words, </span><b>since 2011 the yen and gold are behaving as the same asset class.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The proof for this statement is visible in the first set of charts that we have shown.</span>
<h3><b>Yen and Gold – the Same?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, fundamentally we know that the Japanese yen and gold are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the same asset classes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, one is a fiat currency which may be printed ad infinitum by a central bank, while the other is a finite element which has served as a store of wealth for at least 5,000 years.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundamentally, the yen and gold are certainly not equal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, as we see from the graphs above, the market is treating the two as essentially the same since 2011. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are we, as investors, to make the nearly perfect correlation between the Japanese currency and gold? Why are these two markets so tightly intertwined? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, when will the correlation cease, and how can we use this knowledge in our investment plans going forward?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will address these questions and more in Part II of this series on the Japanese yen versus gold, next week…</span>

		<title>Are Gold and the Japanese Yen Equal? (Part II)</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/14/are-gold-and-the-japanese-yen-equal-part-ii/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/07/are-gold-and-the-japanese-yen-equal-part-i/">Part 1 of this series</a> last week, we examined the relationship between the Japanese yen and gold. We showed that both yen and gold have been highly correlated since 2011, moving closely in tandem during both corrections and surges since their respective peaks nearly six years ago.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As precious metals investors, what are we to make of this correlation? And how can we use the correlation to our advantage in the future?</span>
<h3><b>Why Does the Correlation Exist?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, let us address the “why” behind the yen/<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> correlation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line is that no one truly knows why the correlation exists because correlations between diverse asset classes never exist for solely one reason. Anyone who claims to have “the” answer in reality only has one of the said answers – because markets are made up millions of individuals, each acting on their own particular causes and assumptions. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, we can look to identify some contributing causes. Much of the correlation has to do with the perceived safety status of the Japanese yen. Although still a fiat currency, the yen in recent years has come to be known in the international trade as one of the safest currencies in the world, perhaps even more so than the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/31/us-dollar-approaching-critical-support/">US dollar. </a></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan is notable for its low inflation relative to other developed world economies. Although the country has a large public debt, much of that debt is held domestically by investors. Japan also has a significant trade surplus, selling more to foreign trade partners than it imports. The yen-carry trade, a popular funding mechanism of the past decade in which investors borrow Japanese yen to buy assets in foreign countries, is a testament to the perceived stability of the Japanese economy and its ultra-low interest rates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these reasons contribute to the safe-haven status of the yen, which in turn drives the correlation with gold.</span>
<h3><b>Looking for Confirmation Signals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there is a myriad of reasons why the correlation is in place, for our purposes it will be more valuable to accept that it does indeed exist, and to next look for ways to utilize this information. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the more valuable forms of analysis we can thereby perform is to monitor for either confirmation or non-confirmation signals between the yen to dollar cross-pair (JPY/USD) and gold. These can help us gauge major turning points in the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in June 2015 gold began to make new lows under the $1,200/oz mark, eventually hitting $1,045 in December of that year. However, note that the Japanese yen failed to make a new similar low, instead of increasing marginally from 0.7950 to 0.8125 during this time:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2394" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Jap-Yen-to-US-Dollar.png" alt="Jap Yen to US Dollar" width="652" height="685" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall the main chart from last week’s article, showing the near perfect correlation over six years between the pair. Here in 2015 was a non-confirmation signal for gold’s final plunge in 2015. The yen and gold were, in fact, moving in opposite directions as a net sum over the final months of the decline.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What did this non-confirmation in the yen signal for gold? We will let the charts speak for themselves, by extending out the above by another seven months:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2395" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Japanese-Yen-to-US-Dollar.png" alt="Japanese Yen to US Dollar" width="645" height="691" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is clear that the non-confirmation signal in the yen in late 2015 was an excellent predictor of what is now seen as the final low for gold’s 2011 – 2015 bear market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an important signal for those who are interested in gauging likely turning points in the gold market. Of course, no signal will be perfect 100% of the time. But we can push the odds of probability into our favor for the gold market if we pay attention to these confirmation or non-confirmation signals in the Japanese yen.</span>
<h3><b>Watch for the Correlation to End</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A final point on the topic for the time being: no correlation will last forever. There will come a time when – for fundamental reasons which will only be revealed after the fact – the tight correlation between the yen and gold will sever.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What more, the </span><b>period of time following the breaking of this relationship will be important for precious metals investors to pay attention to</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because it will signify either a rapid acceleration higher in the price of gold, or a severe plunge, depending on the direction in which the correlation breaks. To illustrate, refer to the following set of imbedded charts of the yen/gold ratio:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2396" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Japanese-Yen-and-Gold-ratio.png" alt="Japanese Yen and Gold ratio" width="932" height="874" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will know the correlation is ending when the yen/gold ratio breaks either above or below the converging set of (blue) trendlines which have defined the relationship since 2011. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When zoomed in (bottom chart), due to the extension of the y-axis on this timescale, it appears that there is much variability which can still occur in the confines of this relationship. However, when we refer back to the original (top) chart, we can see that in the grand scheme of these two asset classes, the correlation is still very tight indeed. A breaking point could come at any time within the next 12-24 months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the convergence breaks higher (less likely) it will signify that the yen is set to gain value relative to gold. Conversely, if the ratio breaks lower (more likely) it will hint that after six years gold is finally ready to resume leadership amongst the safe-haven assets again, with a price rise in all currencies including the yen.</span>

		<title>Gold Breakout – Higher Targets in Sight</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/21/gold-breakout-higher-targets-in-sight/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2017 16:02:56 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks ago <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> broke higher through the long-term declining downtrend which has defined the period of falling prices since 2011. That year, gold peaked at $1,923 per ounce, while <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> peaked just shy of $50. Over the past six years, despite many attempts to gather momentum to the upside, gold has been unable to overcome this key technical resistance level. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the surge of first-half 2016, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> has made no less than seven attempts to overcome this downtrend. Those attempts are highlighted on the chart below by the magenta-colored arrows. Each time gold reached this declining trend, sellers showed up, and forced the price back lower – sometimes by only $40 - $50 per ounce, yet sometimes by over $200 per ounce, as was seen last November.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2441" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Gold-2011-present.png" alt="Gold 2011- present" width="1060" height="793" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold has now made its most legitimate breakout attempt – and furthermore, it has sustained the breakout for two full weeks. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we examine price projections, we must note that for the breakout to remain valid, </span><b>prices must remain above $1,260 on a daily closing basis</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If this level were to fail, it would invalidate the breakout, and we would have (once again) another failed attempt. False-moves are possible in all markets, and the best way to handle them is to have a defined price point whereby if a failure occurs, we can examine alternate scenarios. Again, $1,260 must hold – and thus far, prices have done so.</span>
<h3><b>Breakout Importance</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of this trend break should not be underestimated. Many technical-based buyers have remained on the sidelines for the past six years as gold prices moved lower and then drifted sideways. A sustained break above a declining trendline is often a signal that investors will use to tell them the period of falling prices is likely over. We expect these investors will begin entering the gold market in the near future, and momentum will begin to build.</span>
<h3><b>Short-Term Resistance Levels</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next several weeks, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/05/gold-a-large-move-is-approaching/">gold</a> still must overcome the $1,300 zone as initial resistance. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,300 has held prices lower since the reversal which took place on the night of Trump’s victory, last November. This is presently the third attempt for gold to overcome this price, and each attempt represents a “chipping away” by buyers at the overhang of sellers who are exiting their positions near break even. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What will typically happen as a specific horizontal resistance level is preparing to be broken is that the reactions lower on each failure will become less and less severe, indicating buyers are stepping in at higher price points at every sell-off. In the near future, we expect $1,300 will be broken – and at that point, a whole new class of buyers will begin paying attention to the precious metals market.</span>
<h3><b>Intermediate Price Targets</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming gold can remain above $1,260 and soon recapture $1,300, thus solidifying the long-term downtrend break, we have much higher price targets ahead over the next 6-18 months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Three specific price targets occur within a close proximity, and this confluence represents our highest probability target:</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consolidation which took place from December 2015 through August 2017 featured an amplitude of $330 per ounce, from the low of $1,045 to the high of $1,375. This consolidation took place in the form of a giant triangle-shaped formation. In technical analysis when triangle-consolidation breaks, the target is derived from an equal measurement of the amplitude ($330), added onto the apex of the triangle ($1,205). This calculation gives a target of $1,535. </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is clear horizontal resistance visible on the chart at $1,525 (black line). This level formerly acted as support in 2011 – 2013 and then failed on the fourth test in early 2013. Generally, defined former support levels will subsequently act as resistance on the next attempt to overcome them as sellers emerge.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire 2011 – 2015 decline comes in at $1,485. Fibonacci was an Italian mathematician of the 12</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century who discovered that many aspects of nature – sea shells, hurricanes, flower petals – all follow a similar ratio pattern. Financial markets often follow these similar patterns, the markets being a component of (human) nature.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, </span><b>we have three strong technical targets between $1,485 - $1,535, and this level represents our highest probability for a future intermediate gold peak</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These targets should be reached within 6-18 months, depending on the host of geopolitical and market factors impacting the precious metals. These represent starting targets only, at which point new analysis will be required.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming gold maintains above $1,260 in the coming weeks, this technical breakout is significant and bears monitoring by investors. We expect that when $1,300 is broken, momentum will begin to pick up notably on the way to the higher targets. Investors may choose to accelerate a certain percentage of purchases as fitting in with an overall investment plan.</span>

		<title>Thoughts on Precious Metals as Summer Winds Down</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">As summer winds down in the northern hemisphere, first and foremost our thoughts and prayers go out to those who are being impacted by the destruction of Hurricane Harvey in Texas.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer tends to be the slowest time of year for most of the financial markets. The phrase “sell in May and go away” summarizes the strategy that many traders take of exiting their positions at the end of the spring and not returning until after Labor Day. Although the precious metals occupy a unique space within the investment world, some of these same seasonal factors do impact the prices of the metals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us examine the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> seasonality chart, showing average monthly returns since 1975:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2477 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/a_seasonal.png" alt="Gold seasonality" width="681" height="344" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we can see, the May through July period is historically the slowest of the year for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, featuring not only the lowest volatility but often an important price low forming in July.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The strong seasonal period begins in August and continues through September, largely as a result of physical demand from the Indian wedding and Chinese holiday seasons. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we should point out that after what is typically a weak month in October, gold still has four strong months ahead through February. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, the August through February period is the strongest time for precious metals historically, and we are now at the beginning of that period, with gold already having broken through its long-term downtrend technical resistance (<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/21/gold-breakout-higher-targets-in-sight/">see the article</a>, last week).</span>
<h3><b>Volatility Remains at Record Lows</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us not forget, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold</a> is approaching its strongest period of the year amidst what is still the lowest daily volatility observed over the past nine years. Below we update gold’s volatility chart:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2478 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b_vol.png" alt="Gold Index" width="686" height="266" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility is a direction-neutral measure. In other words, it only tells us that a period of higher volatility is set to follow, but not in which direction the upcoming moves will occur. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When we juxtapose strong seasonality factors emerging amidst a market that is within record-low volatility and already showing initial hints of technical breakouts, what we can say is that the precious metals are set for strong moves ahead. Our initial assessment is that those moves will be higher, but we will not take anything for granted and always keep one eye on the charts on a regular basis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The charts we feature here focus primarily on the “what” aspect of the market – they do not tell us the “why”. The metals are like dry tinder at present with lightning visible in the distance. The market is waiting for a spark… what could that be?</span>
<h3><b>Potential Sparks for Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tensions are brewing amongst US economic policymakers, and Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, gave an example of that on Friday. In a speech at the economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Yellen discussed the role that the US central bank had in propping up the financial system after the crash of 2008 through bailouts and increased regulation. The most prescient quote from the speech was as follows:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><b>Because of the reforms that strengthened our financial system</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>and with support from monetary and other policies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, credit is available on good terms, and lending has advanced broadly in line with economic activity in recent years, contributing to today’s strong economy.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we see Yellen hinting that she will not favor the loosening of regulations that were enacted after the financial crisis of 2008, something the Trump administration has pushed for in recent months. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yellen’s term as chairwoman is up this February and speculation is that Trump may not re-nominate her for the position. The speech at Jackson Hole tends to reinforce that a shakeup may be coming at the Fed early next year. And uncertainty in the financial system tends to provide support for gold.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, saber-rattling continues between the United States and North Korea. While gold price spikes based on the fear of isolated geopolitical events tend to not be sustained, certainly if any sort of extended political or military confrontation were to develop between these two nuclear powers, gold would see a sustained bid. At what point do these idle threats that we see quoted so often begin to be taken seriously by one side or the other?</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2479" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/c_korea-1.png" alt="" width="620" height="313" />
<h3><b>Takeaway on the End of Summer and Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial technical breakouts have already been observed on the charts in recent weeks.  Gold is entering its historically-strongest period of the year due to seasonal demand from India and China, amidst a backdrop of decade-low volatility. The precious metals are set to react strongly when a fundamental spark presents itself. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy your final week of the summer!  </span>

		<title>Gold Breaks 2016 High in Japan… US to Follow?</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest news for the precious metals investors this week was not the gain in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> or <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, nor the continued weakness in the US dollar. </span><b>The most important news for precious metals investors was the price increase of gold in Japanese yen terms. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">After several years of tight correlation, these markets are in the process of changing behavior, yet this important shift is still being largely ignored by the mainstream press. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In early August (</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/07/are-gold-and-the-japanese-yen-equal-part-i/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part 1 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/14/are-gold-and-the-japanese-yen-equal-part-ii/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part 2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) we covered the historically tight correlation that has existed between the Japanese yen and gold prices dating back to 2011. If you did not have the opportunity to do so, please check out those posts for a better understanding of the analysis that follows.</span>
<h3><b>Gold in Yen Breakout </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a>, as priced in Japanese yen, broke above its 2016 high in sudden fashion, rising from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¥141,300 per ounce to ¥146,095, a gain of 3.3%. The technical action is highlighted below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2530" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/a_GoldJPY.png" alt="Break above 2016 high " width="540" height="354" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We made the case in the past linked articles that a key determinant for a more significant precious metals advance in US dollar terms would be when the strong correlation between the Japanese yen and gold prices begins to break down.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is the updated long-term ratio between yen and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold</a>, which shows that the two have essentially acted as the same asset class as a net sum since 2011:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2531" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/b_LT.png" alt="Japanese Yen to Gold ratio" width="1040" height="618" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To see the 2016 high for gold in yen exceeded this week tells us that the 6-year correlation is beginning to weaken. It is the breaking of this correlation which will eventually help gold to assume its proper role as safe-haven of last resort.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will look for a major advance at gold prices worldwide to correspond with a breaking of the lower (blue) trend line of the Japanese yen/gold ratio, which should begin with gold breaking above </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¥151,000 per ounce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or a 3.5% further gain as priced in yen from last week’s close. This could occur within the next 2-3 weeks.</span>
<h3><b>North Korea Fires Missile Over Japan… Tests Hydrogen Bomb</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We never like to attribute one single cause to a market reaction. After all, the market is the sum of millions of distinct individuals, each acting upon their own unique beliefs, strengths, and fears. </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2532" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/c_NKorea.png" alt="c_NKorea" width="602" height="550" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, it is likely that a portion of the movement into gold by Japanese investors this week was due to fears over North Korea. The latter is noted to have – for the first time ever – launched a ballistic missile directly over Japan, which then landed east off the coast in the Pacific Ocean. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">North Korea is subsequently reported to have tested a hydrogen bomb on Sunday.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tensions are certainly high between the United States, North Korea, and Japan, and while gold price spikes due to isolated geopolitical tensions are typically short-lived, those which foreshadow lengthy periods of conflict tend to be important early-warning indicators for more sustained price advances to develop throughout time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is too early to say with any certainty how the current standoff between these nuclear powers will end, but by breaking above 2016 highs on the chart, gold priced in Japanese yen is signaling something important for those who would listen: the correlation between the two safe-havens is breaking… in favor of gold.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is unlikely that the 6-year tight correlation will end in one week, but initial hints that this is in progress are plainly visible on the charts. We will continue to monitor this development at regular intervals for the foreseeable future. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All asset correlations eventually change. When gold begins to advance in yen terms it signifies that the precious metal is picking up on new fundamentals, and set to be the safe-haven of last resort. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the upcoming week, we watch to see if gold can match its similar 2016 high in US dollar terms, which comes in at $1,378.   </span>

		<title>Lessons from September 11 for Gold Prices</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a common warning given in the mainstream financial press that goes something like this: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do not buy gold during a geopolitical crisis because as soon as tensions fade the precious metal will give back all of its gains.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to look no further than recent articles available online to confirm this warning, such as this one published last week from CNBC:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2553" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/12-month-high-on-North-Korea-a_CNBC.png" alt="12 month high on North Korea a_CNBC" width="428" height="528" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the above warning accurate? Are the “experts” correct that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> should retrace if recent tensions with North Korea recede?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is: it depends on what timescale one is referring to. Yet by making a blanket statement and not quantifying the above warning with the proper perspective, this and similar articles risk misleading investors as a critical time period unfolds for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> over the next few years.  Let us examine a historical example.</span>
<h3><b>September 11</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Exactly 16 years ago today, let us rewind back to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to examine the price action in gold from a technical basis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">September 11 was a Tuesday, and on the day of the attacks, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins/gold-american-eagle/gold-eagles">gold</a> spiked in price from $273 per ounce to $290, a 6.2% gain. In today’s dollars, that would equate to an $84 intraday spike. The price action in the year leading up to the attack and in the months following is shown below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2554" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2-pic.-b_911.png" alt="2 pic. b_911" width="955" height="714" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that after the September 11 surge, gold topped out over the following three weeks just below $300 per ounce. Moreover, in the two months that followed and as fears of an Armageddon scenario faded, gold did indeed give back all of its gains. Specifically, on November 24, gold closed below $272, which was the opening price from the morning of 9/11.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many who bought gold in the days following the attacks were surely frustrated to be sitting on losses within a few months, and those who did not put this price action into proper context likely sold and moved on to other asset classes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But even though gold did give back all of its short-term gains, was selling and moving on wise in hindsight?</span>
<h3><b>Increased Technical Perspective</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us back out the above chart for increased perspective to examine some of the technical trends that were in play at the time. Below we show gold from 1997 – 2002. The same 9/11 geopolitical price spike is again highlighted:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2560" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/c_9702.png" alt="c_9702" width="1102" height="825" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, gold had seen significant multi-year downtrend breaks leading up to the 9/11 price spike, shown above by the red callouts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A double-bottom was observed in April 2001, matching within a few dollars the July 1999 price of $252 per ounce.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, gold was showing several classic technical patterns indicating that a trend change from the prior years of falling prices was in the process of unfolding. The September 11 terrorist-related spike, while it was given back over the course of the following two months, was itself actually part of a longer basing formation for the precious metals in the early 2000’s.</span>
<h3><b>Longer-Term Perspective</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">How did the “isolated” September 11 price spike look when viewed within the context of the bull market which unfolded over the next 10 years? The following chart speaks for itself, where the spike can barely be seen amidst the more significant bottom that served as a launching pad for the next decade. </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2557" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pic-4-Geopolitical-price-d_LT.png" alt="pic 4 Geopolitical price d_LT" width="1075" height="804" />
<h3><b>Back to the Present</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tensions between the United States and North Korea continue to pick up in intensity. The gold price has spiked nearly $100 over the last six weeks. If tensions fade, will gold give back all of its gains?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, would selling in such a scenario be the proper decision?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Examine the gold price action since 2011, below. Note the now-ongoing five-year cup base formation that is nearing its later stages, following an important break of the 2011 – 2017 downtrend. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Does this chart not bear striking resemblance to the 1997 – 2002 chart, above, which also featured similar downtrend breaks amidst a multi-year cup basing formation?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You be the judge.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2556" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pic-3-Cup-Base-e_current-1.png" alt="pic 3 Cup Base e_current" width="1125" height="842" />
<h3><b>Takeaway on Geopolitical Events and Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold may indeed see a short-term retracement if tensions fade between the United States and North Korea (<a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/09/05/gold-breaks-2016-high-in-japan-us-to-follow/">Read our previous article</a>). Gold could give back $100 per ounce just as quickly as it gained it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the historic store of wealth is now five years into a clear basing process, one that is playing out irrespective of any short-term geopolitical price spikes. Multi-year bases are important setups for future market trends. The lessons from the 1997 – 2002 timeframe, which includes the spike seen on September 11, should be important for investors to keep in mind as they navigate what should be a volatile final quarter to 2017. Geopolitical tensions come and go, but the unemotional language of the charts contains a message all its own.</span>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello KenF, 
Thank you for your great feedback. We're all less or more forced by media and "advisers" around to buy, buy and buy! These timeless questions every investor has: Is now the best time to invest? How to invest wisely?  It’s always difficult to determine if now is the right time to invest and we have to set your objectives (short and long term) for making the appropriate investment selections and stick with our own plan based on daily market changes.]]></wp:comment_content>

You know, it would be really interesting to add to your chart of gold's ups and downs, the level of consumer confidence. See if there is any correlation between those two. It there is, that could be very meaningful.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Christopher,
I really enjoyed your article. It was refreshing to see something written about gold that wasn't all about buy, buy, buy!  
You are right about gold being the 'crisis' investment. But not just about geopolitical crisis, but any crisis.
Fear seems to drive the price of gold more than anything. Especially when you consider what percentage of gold is needed in industry and how much of it is going to just to feed our desire to own it. While a much higher percentage of platinum and silver is needed in indsutry, gold is still king because we want it.
And history has shown that people will do a lot of strange and inconceivable things to own gold.
But while all your charts are extremely interesting, the big wildcard in the entire equation is human emotion.  And there's just no way to chart or predict that aspect and its effect on the value of gold.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Federal Reserve begins its once-per-six-weeks policy meeting on Tuesday, with a statement to be issued by Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Wednesday at 2 pm EST. Expect lower volatility across most markets on Tuesday and Wednesday prior to the announcement, with a spike in volatility immediately after 2 pm. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot know exactly what will be announced on Wednesday, but the charts are positioning themselves for an important low to form across the precious metals complex coming into the meeting. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The markets are pricing in a near-zero chance of an interest rate hike on Wednesday, with roughly a 50% chance for a hike at the last meeting of the year in December.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we show the current dot-plot for interest rate expectations by the 16 members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which gives a consensus estimate for what US short-term interest rates will average for each of the next two years and beyond.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2657" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Federal-reserve.png" alt="Federal reserve" width="521" height="405" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For 2018, the consensus average is 2.00% – 2.25%, which would necessitate four more quarter-point interest rate hikes from the current target of 1.00% - 1.25%. This is the general expectation of the FOMC, although it is always subject to change based on market conditions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there is expected to be no rate hike this Wednesday, the markets will be watching for a potentially more important source of information: language describing the Fed’s intentions to “normalize” its balance sheet going forward. That the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/06/19/fed-rate-hike-and-gold/">Fed is set to normalize its balance</a> sheet was first discussed at the policy meeting in June; however, we have received no tangible information as to how or when the Fed intends to engage in this normalization since.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a reminder, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> sold off strongly on the day that the Fed announced its balance sheet normalization intentions, at the June 14 meeting.</span>
<h3><b>“Normalization” – Say What?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Normalization is a euphemism used by central banks including the Fed: the term is used to describe the selling of bonds and other securities that the Fed has “purchased” since the credit crisis of 2007 – 2009.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall that these bonds – and </span><b>all assets the Fed ever buys – are purchased with freshly created electronic money. </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever the Fed mentions purchasing anything, it is universally talking about printing money and debasing the currency – in other words, creating inflation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is rarely mentioned in mainstream financial publications, as the reality of the situation would be too appalling to discuss in such a forthcoming manner.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, manipulating the prices of assets by purchasing them with newly-created money: this is the only tool that the Fed has ever had.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a reminder of the unprecedented nature of the Fed’s balance sheet, the following chart is reprinted courtesy the Wall Street Journal, which shows the Fed’s holdings from 2004 through the present:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2658" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Building-the-Fed-balance-sheet.png" alt="Building the Fed balance sheet" width="554" height="365" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important point to observe is this: </span><b>it took the Fed from its creation in 1913 through 2008 to accumulate (a.k.a. print) $1 trillion in assets, yet in just the last nine years alone it has printed over $3 trillion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as its balance sheet has grown from $1 trillion to over $4 trillion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second key to recall is that the bulk of the Fed’s purchases have gone toward US treasuries and US mortgages. Is it any wonder that long-term bond and mortgage rates are the lowest they have been since World War II?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fed has completely distorted the very fabric of the financial marketplace, and every piece of the system that sits on top of this distorted base stands to be affected if and when the Fed begins to normalize its balance sheet.</span>
<h3><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2660" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/c_interest.png" alt="c_interest" width="378" height="436" /><b>US Treasury – annual interest expense</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now consider that this near-record interest expense is accumulating when benchmark </span><b>10-year Treasury bonds are at their lowest rates</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in over two generations:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2661" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Long-term-govenrment-Bond-yeild.png" alt="Long term government Bond yield" width="1125" height="433" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, </span><b>the government is paying record high interest when rates are at their lowest in modern history.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Can we imagine if treasury rates simply doubled, back to longer-term averages near 5.0%? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such would mean that the US government’s interest expense would approach $1 trillion per year, assuming no further debt was added into the equation – and of course, new debt keeps being added to the pile each year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What if 10-year yields returned to 7.5%, as they averaged for nearly 25 years from 1970 – 1995?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We must remember, when the Fed states that it intends to normalize its balance sheet, it is saying that </span><b>it intends to sell its recently-purchased treasury bonds, and thus allow interest rates to rise</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Can the Fed realistically be expected to sell much of its balance sheet in the face of record US interest expense, and thus force the government to roll over its debt at higher and higher rates?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The practical answer is: no.</span>
<h3><b>Most Only Know Falling Rates</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us observe: anyone who has been investing in the western world since 1980 knows only falling interest rates as a macroeconomic backdrop. Assuming the average investor begins his or her career at age 22, this means that </span><b>anyone born after 1958 knows only that interest rates keep falling, year after year</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A reversal in 37-years of falling interest rates is what the Fed is proposing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe the Fed has backed itself into a corner, and it will have to renege on its normalization-speak. If it allows interest rates to rise significantly, the central bank will crush the funding mechanism of the US government. If it continues to suppress rates through newly-created money, it will begin to lose credibility as an independent and impartial body.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A loss of confidence in the very institution of central banking in the United States and likely spreading around the western world is the potential if the Fed is not careful.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such will not happen overnight, but the Fed is walking a tight line between its own credibility and the ability of the United States government to fund its operations.</span>
<h3><b>A Third Central Bank Failure?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us not forget: two central banks have already failed in the United States: the First Bank of the United States was dissolved in 1811, and the Second Bank of the United States did not receive a charter renewal in 1836.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Central banking was not present nor required in the United States during the great technological revolutions of the mid-1800’s through early 1900’s, including the implementation of the railroad, the light bulb, the telephone, radio, automobile, and air travel. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Could we be seeing the first warning signs that a third central bank has caught itself in an unsolvable situation and will follow a similar fate as the first two?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In an era of faltering faith in central-bank promises, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> stands to assume its historical function as the premier asset class of last resort – the only financial asset with no counterparty risk and which is nobody else’s liability. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The history books are not written, but the fundamental data points and the quandary the Fed faces are there in plain sight for all to see. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, we watch to observe how the Fed handles its intentions for normalizing its balance sheet at this Wednesday’s meeting, and through the remainder of this year.</span>

		<title>Gold is Testing Important Support</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/09/25/gold-is-testing-important-support/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the decline seen in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/">gold</a> prices over the past three weeks, let us update our technical roadmap for the international store of wealth.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the week as a sum, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> closed lower by 2.1% or nearly $28 to finish at $1,291 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the long-term gold chart below, it is critical to note that the precious metal is now coming back into the zone (green shading) to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the broken long-term 2011 – 2017 downtrend (magenta line). Oftentimes, markets will break out of an important technical boundary, only to reverse and revisit that same price zone several weeks or months later. This is what is now occurring in gold.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2732" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Gold-2008-Present.png" alt="Gold 2008-Present" width="1034" height="727" />
<h3><b>Why do Retests Occur?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Retests occur as short-term traders take profits following an important breakout.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a successful scenario, we expect a return to the breakout point to be bought aggressively by second-chance investors – those who missed the initial move, and who now scoop up gold when the market returns to the same price zone.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, in this case, gold broke its declining long-term downtrend at $1,265 back in mid-August. Because the trendline was downward sloping, if gold were to retest the technical breakout today it could fall all the way back to $1,250 without violating the line from the upper side. It is important to know that retests of technical trendlines may indeed occur at lower prices than their original breakout points.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who only view the price in isolation will be missing an important point: a trend change higher is unfolding on the long-term chart.</span>
<h3><b>Short-Term Support Levels</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold</a> could fall back to $1,250 as part of its trendline retest, our highest probability scenario is that it will not fall that low. Instead, we expect a low to form in the $1,283 - $1,301 region, shown below by the green callout.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2733" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Trump-Reversal-Resistance.png" alt="Trump Reversal Resistance" width="1000" height="749" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This expected low is derived from a confluence of important support levels identified in this range. In technical analysis, whenever we see a confluence of support levels within a narrow band, it represents a high probability target scenario. The specific levels are:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,301 – the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the entire July through September rally (light silver line).</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,300 – important horizontal resistance (black dashed line), which held prices lower for most of 2017, and was then decisively broken during the last week of August. When a level which formerly acted as resistance is finally broken, it should then serve as support the next time prices return there, as second-chance buyers look to enter positions, having missed the initial advance.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,283 – the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the entire July through September rally (light silver line).</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, we have three technical support levels within an $18 price region between $1,283 - $1,301, and this represents a high-probability zone for gold to bottom on the present retracement.</span>
<h3><b>Next Up: 2016 Highs</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The actual high two weeks ago was $1,362, and this figure is close enough to the July 2016 peak at $1,378 that we can call this most recent attempt a functional test of the 2016 resistance zone. The retracement that we are now seeing is expected to be the final drop before the next advance brings gold to fresh highs above 2016 levels.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We watch for lows to develop in the $1,283 - $1,301 range as an ideal short-term technical retracement. We encourage investors to use any price points for spot gold in the $1,200’s as final opportunities for accumulation in these ranges. New highs above 2016 levels should be in store for gold by the end of 2017 if prices continue to hold above the now-broken long-term downtrend on any retest.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver</a> is lagging gold on a relative basis, and next week we will focus more in-depth on what to expect for gold’s cousin on the next move.</span>

		<title>Silver Lagging Gold – Cause for Concern?</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/10/02/silver-lagging-gold-cause-for-concern/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2017 16:58:17 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have not had a good look at <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> in several months, so let us take the opportunity this week to do so.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the stats: for the week ended Friday, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> fell by 1.8% or $0.31 cents, to close at $16.68 as of the final tick for the December futures contract on the New York COMEX. It was the third weekly loss for silver in a row, matching the streak for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>. Silver is down some 8.8% or $1.62 from the recent high of $18.30 in September.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What should we expect going forward? Let us turn to the charts:</span>
<h3><b>Silver Short-Term</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2793" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Flash-Crash-1.png" alt="" width="570" height="515" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If silver continues to falter over the short run, we see minor support near $16.30, at the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the advance starting with the July flash crash lows through the recent peak at $18.30. More important support begins at $16.10 (labeled Initial Support above in black), a level which has held prices higher on five occasions since May 2016. We expect this support zone will hold as <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> now retests its long-term downtrend.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As silver moves higher, significant resistance will still be seen in the region between $18.30 - $19.00, an area representing at least five pivot highs since October 2016. All things considered, we expect sellers to emerge in this region again. This is labeled Primary Resistance on the chart above.</span>
<h3><b>Silver Lagging Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver has been lagging gold since the 2016 peaks for both metals at $21.25 and $1,378, respectively. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In stating this, we are referring to the fact that as of September 2017, gold has come to within 1.2% of its 2016 high at $1,362, while silver has only come to within 14% of its relative 2016 high at $18.30.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, in September silver made a lower high at $18.30 than either of its previous 2017 peaks, both of which just touched $18.50. Meanwhile, gold clearly exceeded its 2017 previous high of $1,295 in September. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Referring back to last week’s article, we continue to expect that gold will exceed its 2016 high on the next rally, either late this year or early 2018. However, our model shows that silver will continue to lag, and not exceed 2016 highs at the same juncture as gold. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Should this lagging be a concern for silver investors?</span>
<h3><b>Silver Underperformance in Perspective</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A common fallacy in the precious metals world is that silver must “confirm” every move in gold, or else the advance in gold is suspect or doomed to failure. We are not sure where this idea originated from, but it is absolutely false when we study the relative performance of both metals at key junctures throughout history.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us consider an example from the past that shares similar technical “basing” characteristics to the current time period for both metals.</span>
<h3><b>2000 – 2004 in Gold and Silver</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver lagged gold notably during the 2000 – 2003 timeframe, as we can observe from the following chart:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2785" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gold-2000-2003.png" alt="Gold 2000-2003" width="537" height="472" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After lengthy bear markets were nearing their terminal stages at the turn of the millennium, notice how gold began to turn upward and finally eclipsed its February 2000 peak at $323 per ounce by December 2002. Meanwhile, silver lagged gold for all of its advance. For example, silver remained well below its related 2000 peak at $5.60 even in December 2002, only reaching $4.85.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Was this underperformance by silver a reason to discount gold’s advance? Or was silver’s lag effect actually an opportunity in disguise for investors who were following the broader market context?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us advance the chart above by one additional year:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2786" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Silver-2011-2017.png" alt="Silver 2011-2017" width="537" height="473" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite lagging for most of the 1999 – 2002 timeframe, silver began to play catch up to gold in early 2003. In fact, silver rose over 90% from the point where our first chart ended in February 2003 through the April 2004 high. During this time, gold advanced only 17%.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors should be aware: most of the “work” in silver investing comes during the waiting. Silver can lag gold for weeks, months, or even years. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when silver does finally begin to catch up, it often does so rapidly and with little warning. The payoff tends to be worth the wait, even if it is frustrating to those with short time horizons.</span>
<h3><b>Expectations for Silver</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite lagging gold recently and our expectation that it may lag for some months further, silver remains in a healthy basing pattern on the long-term chart. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver’s long-term base will eventually be seen to be all price action underneath the key $25/oz level. We expect silver will continue to trade from the mid-teens through the low twenties per ounce for the next 12-24 months, even as gold looks to start a more significant advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During this basing period, metal will be quietly transferred from weak hands to strong.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the basing process completes and silver breaks $25, an entirely new trajectory will begin. But this is likely still 2-3 years into the future.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2794" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Silver.png" alt="" width="566" height="510" />
<h3><b>Takeaway on Silver</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver will play catch up to gold when many least expect it. For now, let us not fall into the trap of assuming that silver underperformance means moves in both metals are suspect. History shows that gold leading silver indicates an early-stage of an emerging advance, not a doomed market.</span>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Christopher, as a bullion dealer, it stands to reason that you'd be bullish on metals.  However, I'm not seeing any underlying principles in your projections to support it.  Do you expect political turmoil in the world, economic uncertainty here in the US, or, maybe, a burst in the stock market bubble, to propel metals forward?  Can you elaborate?
Basing your future projections solely on past statistics is not sound, IMO.  Those fluctuations in the past may have had many different causes that may very well not repeat in the future.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Ronald A,

Thank you for your interest and I appreciate your opinion. Traditionally, we want it or not, there is an inverse relationship between past statistics and future predictions for precious metals.  I expect prices to go up, not because I'm a bullion dealer, but I am also a market analyst, that allows me to explain the science and art of predicting prices. In general, the longer the term for which one would like to predict the prices, the more important are the fundamental issues and look into the previous market's events. As for political turmoil in the world, first, we have to wait until the new Fed Chief will be announced and then it will be more clear should we expect the burst in the stock market bubble or not. Thank you!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Gold and a Falling Gold/Silver Ratio</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/10/09/gold-and-a-falling-goldsilver-ratio/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2017 15:30:50 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold has fallen further over the past week from the correction zone between $1,283 - $1,301 which would have constituted an ideal 38.2% - 50.0% Fibonacci retracement of the July through September advance. However, as discussed in the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/09/25/gold-is-testing-important-support/">gold update</a> two weeks ago, the precious metal could fall all the way back down to $1,240 at this juncture without violating the technical model. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The message of the market remains: <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is retesting the breakout from it's long-term 2011 – 2017 trendline, shown below in the magenta color. The retest zone is now highlighted in green for greater clarity on the intermediate-term chart:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2816" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/a_gold.png" alt="a_gold" width="1061" height="794" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the week as a sum, gold fell nearly $10 or 0.8%, to close at $1,275 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX for the December futures contract.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> bucked the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> trend and finished higher for the week by $0.11 cents or 0.7% to close at $16.79. This represents a falling in the gold to silver ratio (the number of ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold) over the short term.</span>
<h3><b>Lessons from a Falling Gold to Silver Ratio</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The notable action in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> versus gold last week warrants an updated look at this important ratio. (For the chart below, we must switch over to the trading desk because it allows us to view intraday price data, as opposed to COMEX-only price data, as with our usual provider.)</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2817" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/b_ratio.png" alt="b_ratio" width="1108" height="757" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The important points to recall regarding the gold to silver ratio from 2011 through the present:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2011 – 2016 rising channel in the ratio generally corresponded with falling precious metals prices, as gold held its value better on a relative basis. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major 2016 surges in both gold and silver occurred amidst the ratio breaking lower through the rising channel in April 2016, falling from 84 down to 64 ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold by July 2016.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since July 2016, as both metals have corrected in price, the gold to silver ratio has been in a general rising trend again.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the depth of silver’s Flash Crash in July, the ratio peaked at 85, just touching the lower broken boundary of the 2011 – 2016 channel. </span>This was a retest of the broken channel, labeled on the chart, and it represented a spike high – a level which was quickly rejected by the market.</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, the 2011 – 2016 rising channel was decisively broken during 2016’s metals surge. </span><b>This was an important signal of a long-term trend change, of which we are still in the early stages.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect the next major surge in both metals prices to occur when the gold to silver ratio breaks lower from its secondary rising trendline, which is shown on the chart above beginning in July 2016. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, this level would come in at 70 ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Precious Metals Prices This Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If indeed the low for the present retracement has been seen as of Friday with gold touching $1,260 and silver briefly dipping to $16.30, gold will have made a correction that falls still within the valid retest zone of it's long-term 2011 – 2017 downtrend.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The outperformance of silver on Friday is an early positive sign for the sector as a whole.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We continue to expect gold will eclipse its 2016 high of $1,378 on the next primary wave higher, while silver may lag on a relative basis with respect to the time required to break its own high of $21.25. Any such lag in silver should be looked at as an opportunity.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have maintained a target of $1,485 - $1,535 per ounce for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> by the end of 2018 for several months now. This target is based on a measurement of three technical levels which all occur within this $50 swath. As a reminder for new readers of this column, the three target levels we are referring to are:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consolidation from December 2015 through August 2017 featured an amplitude of $330 per ounce, from the low of $1,045 to the high of $1,375. This consolidation took place in the form of a giant triangle on the charts. In technical analysis when a triangle-consolidation break, the target is derived from an equal measurement of the amplitude ($330), added onto the apex of the triangle ($1,205). This calculation gave a target of $1,535. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is clear horizontal resistance visible on the long-term <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> chart at $1,525 (black line). This level formerly acted as support on three occasions in 2011 – 2013 and then failed on the fourth attempt in early 2013. Generally, strong former support levels will subsequently act as intermediate-term resistance on the next attempt to overcome them, as those who previously purchased gold at these higher levels will choose to exit the market at break-even.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire 2011 – 2015 gold decline comes in at $1,485. Fibonacci levels are derived from a pattern which exists in many aspects of nature (such as seashells, hurricanes, and the spirals of the galaxies) called the Fibonacci sequence. Financial markets often follow these similar patterns, the markets being a component of (human) nature.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, when we have a strong confluence of resistance levels within a tight range, this represents a high probability zone for the next target. </span><b>For gold this comes between $1,485 - $1,535.</b>
<h3><b>Record-Breaking Volume a Clue</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, we see clear signs that gold is gaining strength over the short run. As discussed in past articles, gold has already broken it's long-term 2011 – 2017 downtrend. What more, trading volume is picking up, to the extent that Q3 2017 (just closed on September 30) featured </span><b>the highest quarterly volume of gold contracts traded of all time: </b>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2848" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gold-2011-Present.png" alt="Gold 2011-Present" width="566" height="423" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, we can see that this volume surge is occurring still as prices remain at or below 2013 levels. It is often said in a technical analysis that “volume precedes price movement”. These volume spikes are happening now, during the final period of what is still a 5-year basing process (overall flat prices since 2013). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What is shown in these volume spikes is an acceleration in the transfer of gold from weak hands to strong hands, as this base nears its terminal stages?</span>
<h3><b>The Nature of Gold’s Base</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The question surrounding gold’s target remains the timing – and for this we must evaluate the developing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shape</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the ongoing 5-year basing pattern:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2849" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gold-Quarterly-Price.png" alt="Gold Quarterly Price" width="559" height="331" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we can see from the chart, gold’s 5-year basing pattern continues to fit the profile of an early-stage parabolic growth curve, in colloquial terms resembling the “cup” profile (blue). </span><b>The lower range of the early parabolic curve has just been tested with gold’s low price of $1,262 from two Friday’s ago.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Note the blue-callout which points to this location of gold’s recent test of the parabolic curve.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If gold can maintain its early-stage parabolic base pattern (green arrows, above) throughout the remainder of 2017, it argues that our $1,485 - $1,535 target will be reached sooner rather than later, likely by Q2 2018. This may seem improbable for the casual observer of the metals markets, as we have not seen prices that high since early-2013, but it is indeed what is expected given an early-stage parabolic curve which remains unbroken. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If gold fails to maintain this parabolic base (red arrows, above), nothing changes about the target of $1,485 - $1,535. It is only the timing that will change – such will be pushed out toward the end of 2018, possibly to extend into Q1 2019. In sum, in this scenario, more consolidation will need to occur between the recent low of $1,262 and the 2016 peak ($1,378), before gold is ready to advance.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Record-breaking volume is being witnessed coming into the gold market. This is occurring amidst a period of five years in which prices have moved generally sideways as a net sum. The message here is of a market that is picking up interest and nearing the later stages of its basing process.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The remainder of the price action in 2017 will give us strong clues as to how soon our stated target zone will be reached. A continuation of an initial parabolic curve will bring a quicker target, while a breaking of this curve will result in a lengthier consolidation prior to the targets being reached.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us keep our eyes on gold carefully over the next three months.</span>

		<title>Changes at the Federal Reserve?</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/10/23/changes-at-the-federal-reserve/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two important events are unfolding at the largest central bank in the world within the next two weeks:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/06/19/fed-rate-hike-and-gold/">The Fed gathers to set interest rate</a> and monetary policy at its once-per-six weeks meeting: on October 31 – November 1.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Trump is due to announce his candidate for the new Fed chair, and thus by default likely ousting current chairwoman Janet Yellen.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Rate Hike Odds</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the interest rate front, the futures market is pricing in overwhelming odds that there will be no hike at the coming meeting. The odds are 98.5% that the Fed maintains the current target rate, at 1.00% - 1.25%, as seen in the probability chart at right:  </span>

<img class="wp-image-2894 aligncenter" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/a_prob.png" alt="a_prob" width="452" height="294" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, our proprietary Fed-watch indicator, which relies on 3-month US Treasury yields as a leading signal for Fed interest rate hikes, is offering a slightly different perspective. [For context: 3-month yields have generally been rising 1-2 months before each Fed rate hike, as can be seen by the green highlights below.]</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note how although yields are still not back to their short-term July peak, they are indeed steadily rising again (blue callout):</span>

<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2895" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/b_3mo_gold.png" alt="b_3mo_gold" width="579" height="599" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If yields meet or exceed their July peak at 1.15 before December, we predict the Fed will indeed hike by another 0.25% at the December meeting.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The critical point on the above chart is to recall that each Fed rate hike since 2015 (itself the first in a decade) has witnessed a sequentially higher associated <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> price (black arrows, above). Thus, the expectation of another rate hike to come deserves our continued monitoring.</span>
<h3><b>Yellen Out?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chairwoman Yellen’s term is set to expire in February. Reports over the last week from unnamed Fed officials have hinted that Trump may choose to not renew Yellen’s term. The leading replacement candidate is Jerome Powell, who is currently a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2896" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/c_Fedchair-1.png" alt="c_Fedchair (1)" width="624" height="223" />
<h3><b>Yellen to be replaced by Powell?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If Trump indeed chooses to not renew Yellen’s position, it will mark the shortest tenure of a Fed chair since    G. William Miller was ousted by President Carter in 1979 after less than 18 months in office.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Steven Beckner, a Federal Reserve analyst, offered this summary on Miller’s short time in service at the Fed:</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under Arthur Burns, who chaired the Fed from 1970 to 1978, and under G. William Miller, who was chairman… to August 1979, the Fed provided the monetary fuel for an inflation that began as a flicker and grew into a fearsome blaze... If Nixon appointee Burns lit the fire, Miller poured gasoline on it during the administration of President Jimmy Carter. Without question, the most partisan and least respected chairman in the Fed's history, this former Textron executive worked in tandem with fellow Carter appointee, Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal, in pursuit of monetary policies that were expansionist domestically and devaluationist internationally. The goals were to spur employment and exports, with little thought to the dollar's value. By early 1980, inflation was running at 14 percent per year.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">May we then ask: why do reports suggest that Yellen will have the shortest term since Miller, who was responsible for the highest inflation rate in US history? What is occurring inside the central bank to cause Trump’s apparent distrust of Yellen? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A non-renewal after just one term in office is as close to firing a Fed chair as possible without the political embarrassment associated. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Something is not right within the US executive branch / Federal Reserve relationship. We suspect that recent analysis showing a long-term top being put into place in the US dollar is partly related to this instability within the central bank, which may be further expressed within the next two weeks in a Yellen departure announcement.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two central banks have previously been dissolved in the history of the United States. Stay tuned – the lasting success of this institution is not written in stone.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently I needed to sell some of my long-term precious metals holdings. The reason? To pay for some unforeseen business expenses.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the prospect of selling some physical metals first dawned on me, at first I felt resistance to the idea. How could I sell now, at current prices? What if prices rose after I sold? Would it be better to sell my <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"></a>or <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a>? Maybe I should take out a business loan instead?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These were all questions that arose soon after I began to contemplate the logistics of the transaction. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And they are important questions: after all, some of these precious metals I have been holding for well over a decade.   </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, I decided that I would indeed sell the metals as opposed to taking out a loan. While one could argue that with today’s low-interest rates, I might have been better off locking in a low-rate loan, it felt more sound for me to pay for the expense outright at this juncture. Perhaps the value of keeping life simple is worth more than a specific amount of dollars during certain time periods.</span>
<h3><b>Questions to Ask Oneself</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In completing the transaction, I began to review how many personal factors go into the decision to buy or sell precious metals. In this series of articles, we often focus on macroeconomic trends and price analysis, but there is an equally important number of personal factors that must go into each individual’s investment planning:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, let us consider the simple question of choosing whether to invest primarily in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> or in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> (or <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> or <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">palladium</a> for that matter). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What on the surface seems like it should be a simple question is often found to require a multi-faceted thought process. For example, one must consider:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Does one intend to hold the metals personally, or have them stored in a vault? </b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of holding the metals personally are that one does not have to pay for storage, and no third party ever has a record of the transaction, so privacy is maintained. However, the downsides are that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/how-to/where-to-hide-bullion-home">storage space</a> may be limited, and one’s living space may not be suitable for this. Concerns of theft may also exist. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And indeed, at the present gold to silver ratio of 75-1, the amount of personal space and/or fees required to store $10,000 worth of gold (approximately equivalent to eight 1-ounce coins) is extremely small compared to the space needed to store the same dollar amount of silver (560 1-ounce coins). These practical considerations are paramount for some.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>What are the individual’s risk tolerance and time horizon? </b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold is known to be more stable in value than silver – both when the metals are rising and when they are falling. For example, from the December 2015 low in both metals to the July 2016 highs, gold rose 32%, from $1,045 per ounce to $1,378. Meanwhile, silver rose 56% over the same timeframe, from $13.65 per ounce to $21.25. Clearly a nice outperformance by silver.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, let us consider another time period: 2011 – 2015. From gold’s peak in 2011 at $1,923 to its low over four years later at $1,045, the metal lost 45% of its value. Meanwhile, silver, which peaked at $49 in 2011, lost an incredible 72% in falling down to $13.65.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The point is: in choosing between gold and silver, an individual’s own time horizon and risk tolerance must be weighed. In a rising metals-price backdrop, silver tends to lag gold initially, and then play catch up on a greater percentage basis later in time. It may, therefore, be more appropriate for long-term investors with a higher risk tolerance. However, when the metals fall, gold tends to hold its value more so than silver. Gold provides a buffer to the extreme volatility of silver’s fluctuations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These two broad topics – storage and risk tolerance – are just two of the important issues an investor must ask himself when engaging in physical precious metals transactions. Of course, there are other considerations as well: premiums paid above spot price, taxes, and the ability to easily travel and/or barter with the metals are all factors that may or may not be important for an individual.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, there is never anyone right or wrong answer – the questions lie with the individual. No single plan of action will serve all investors. A realistic examination of one’s own goals and tolerances for risk must be considered:</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Know thyself.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">-Ancient Greek proverb, Temple of Apollo at Delphi</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2954" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/a_Delphi.png" alt="" width="706" height="469" />
<h3><b>Which Did I Choose?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So in the end, which did I end up selling to pay for the business expenses: gold or silver?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not what I prior thought I might have sold in such a situation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While I do have a long-term time horizon, and my risk tolerance is high, I actually choose to sell some silver to raise my funds.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? I’m planning a move in the near future, and the thought of discreetly carrying a few <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold coins</a> with me to my new home was more appealing than transporting a box with hundreds of ounces of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/bars">silver</a> to a new neighborhood.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, this might not have been the right choice for everyone – nor myself even in a different circumstance – but for the present moment, it was right for me.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the end, I felt a sense of gratitude to have had the capital – crystalized in precious metals form – available for when I needed it. Ultimately, I have seen that the disciplined accumulation of capital is one of the most powerful benefits of regularly investing in precious metals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Which do you choose as your precious metal of choice – gold or silver – and why?</span>

		<title>Central Bank Shake-Ups Around the World</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/11/06/central-bank-shake-ups-around-world/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although we are primarily focused here on <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> as priced in US dollars – as this remains the standard by which international traders and mining companies mark their assets – we remain cognizant that a worldwide movement of capital into precious metals is what will account for the bull market that we believe is just in the beginning stages of developing. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus we look elsewhere around the globe periodically. This past week the Bank of England under Governor Mark Carney raised interest rates by 0.25% to a new mark of 0.50%. While the fact that this was the first interest rate hike in the UK in 10 years is getting most of the mainstream attention, what is not being highlighted is that interest rates still remain at the lowest levels </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ever recorded</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the British monetary system. Below we show the Bank of England prime rate from the abolishment of the Bretton Woods <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> standard in 1971 (when currencies were allowed to float freely versus the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/31/us-dollar-approaching-critical-support/">US dollar</a>) through the present:</span>

[caption id="attachment_2979" align="aligncenter" width="737"]<img class="wp-image-2979 size-full" title="Interest rates rise to 0.5%" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/a_UK_int.png" alt="" width="737" height="530" /> Interest rates rise to 0.5%[/caption]

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We must also note: not only have interest rates been held lower from 2007 through present than any time in modern history, but they have also remained lower than the rate the Bank of England set during World War II (2.0%). Can we truly fathom that </span><b>England’s banking authorities deemed the nation’s economy to be in worse condition over the past 10 years than during the deadliest conflict in all of human history?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the unprecedented nature of the time we live in.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those new to central banking should know that the controlling organization does not simply have a lever to pull to lower interest rates at will. No – central banks must continually print money to buy short-term bonds in order to keep interest rates suppressed below the level at which the market would naturally set. This is a principal reason why low-interest rates are inflationary: money is continually being created each month as the central banks hold rates down.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be no surprise then that M3 money supply in the UK – the broadest measure of the total quantity of British pounds in existence – has nearly doubled since 2007, and indeed, is up over 5-fold since 1992:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2980" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/b_UKMS.png" alt="UK Money supply" width="892" height="412" />
<h3><b>Trump Nominates Powell</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile on the other side of the Atlantic, President Trump this past week has finalized his nomination for new <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/10/23/changes-at-the-federal-reserve/">Federal Reserve chair</a>: Jerome Powell. In recent weeks we covered how – if Powell is indeed confirmed – current chairwoman Yellen will have been “terminated” after the shortest tenure as Fed chair since G. William Miller presided over the highest inflation rate (14%) in US history in the late 1970’s.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2981" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/c_Powell.png" alt="c_Powell" width="426" height="300" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What more, Powell was originally selected as a Fed governor under the Obama administration, thus showing us that when it comes to central banking, the Democrat /Republican divide exists in name only: </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Janet Yellen “should be ashamed of herself” for creating “a false stock market” [by keeping interest rates low].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">-Donald Trump, September 2016.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do like the low-interest rate policy… I have a lot of respect” [for Yellen].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">-Donald Trump, July 2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line in central banking is: support primarily exists for Fed member banks at all costs. Everything else – consumer price inflation, unemployment, the value of the currency – comes secondarily.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most major markets were little changed on Thursday / Friday on the news that Yellen will be replaced by Powell – indicating that the status quo of sufficient money-printing to maintain the solvency of member banks will remain in place even when the new chair takes office in February 2018.</span>
<h3><b>Gold Price Update</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/bars/">Gold</a> remains in the midst of its long-term downtrend retest zone. For the week, the historic store of wealth finished lower by a fraction, down 0.2% or $3 to finish at $1,269 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon. As precious metals investors, we must primarily focus on the main gold chart at all times, and nothing about the technical action over the past week has changed the fact that a 6-year downtrend (magenta line) is now in the process of retesting its breakout point. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins/">Gold</a> is attempting to establish a new trend. We must let this retesting process play out:</span>

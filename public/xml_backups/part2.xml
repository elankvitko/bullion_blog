		<title>Gold Predicts Advance in the US Dollar</title>
		<content><![CDATA[The big driver impacting the precious metals market this past week has been the US dollar. We have been watching this converging wedge formation in the dollar index, a measure of the US dollar versus a basket of foreign currencies, for several months, and this past week the formation broke higher in favor of the dollar (see red highlight circle in the chart below).

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-801" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_gold-price-USD.png" alt="gold-price-usd" width="1240" height="737" />

&nbsp;

As we know, over the short run <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold tends</a> to move inversely to the US dollar.

Interestingly, gold had broken below its $1,305 consolidation support <em>a week before</em> the dollar broke higher from the pattern above. Gold, essentially, anticipated the strengthening of the US dollar prior to it actually occurring.

We can see the inverse correlation between the dollar and gold on the chart below clearly over the last 3 weeks.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-802" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/b_USD-Gold-correlation-october.png" alt="usd-gold-correlation-october" width="838" height="559" />

&nbsp;

Now since October 6, gold has been giving the opposite signal to the preemptive drop from late September. Essentially, gold has moved sideways in a consolidation since that date, even as the dollar has continued to rise.

What gold is saying over the last few weeks is that it doesn't "believe" the dollar's most recent advance is going to last.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Watching for a Top in the US Dollar</strong>

Refer back to the US dollar index chart at the top of the article.

Again, the dollar has broken higher from the wedge consolidation defined by the two converging trendlines since May of this year. Closing at 98 on the dollar index last week, it has been the 3 point move higher from 95 to 98 which has resulted in gold's drop from $1,315 to $1,250.

The dollar is now nearing another test of the 100 level on the index, a measure which has acted as resistance for the last two years.

&nbsp;

We will be watching the action in the US dollar index carefully over the next few weeks. <strong>Should the dollar further levitate toward the 100 resistance zone while gold continues to hold its recent lows, it will be a strong signal that the dollar is putting in a long-term top in this region.</strong> Accordingly, the most recent decline in gold will be seen to be simply the first minor correction in the early phases of a long-term secular advance higher, an advance that ultimately should correspond with a worldwide awakening to the knowledge that all currencies -- not just the US dollar -- are inherently flawed in their present fiat form.

That said, and as we have witnessed, we should expect the most sizeable moves in gold to occur opposite the US dollar, as a weakening in the world's reserve currency will have an outsized impact on the entire world financial system as it is defined in the post-Bretton Woods era.

Let us watch the related moves in the dollar index and gold closely over the next several weeks.
<h2>Gold Analysis</h2>
For the week, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> was up $3 from the Friday prior to close near $1,255 on the New York COMEX exchange.

The historic store of wealth is attempting to stabilize in the strong support zone we have identified below in green. Notably, thus far despite several intraday drops into the zone, buyers have stepped in each time and the precious metals has closed each day above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire December through July advance. This level comes in at $1,251.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-803" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/c_Gold-downtrend-october.png" alt="gold-downtrend-october" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

The higher within the zone of $1,200 - $1,251 that gold can stabilize, the more likely that the long-term downtrend line (magenta color) will be broken on the next series of attempts, which early estimates suggest could occur as early as December.

As technical-based analysts also looking at downside potential, we continue to identify the $1,173 price level as the final "must hold" zone for gold's new bull market. If this level were to breach, it would tell us that -- despite the fundamentals that we know to be true (worldwide central bank money printing, unprecedented low interest rates, unsustainable debt levels) -- another fundamental factor must then be impacting the markets that we must not be fully aware of.

One of the founding principles of our investment philosophy is we cannot possibly know ever factor that is impacting a set market at a given time, because the market is composed of hundreds of millions of individuals, each with their own set of hopes, fears, strengths, weaknesses, assumptions, research, and goals.

Yet to be successful, we do not need to know what each individual is thinking. By paying attention to the sum of the market -- which manifests in the price that is printed each day -- we can align ourselves with the strongest trend as it is occurring.

We have no desire to be right on the fundamentals but wrong on the actual market, a problem which plagues many fundamental-only based investors. As of now, it still appears that the December bottom was an important long-term flexion point... but if anything changes this outlook, we will be sharing it with you here.

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">November is a dazzling month for the Perth Mint with these astounding silver coin releases:</span>

<b>Australia’s iconic wildlife symbols - The 2016 High Relief Silver Proof 3-Coin set</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Perth Mint offers a fantastic coin set that includes three of its most popular coins - the Australian Kangaroo, Koala, and Kookaburra. Each coin from this exclusive set showcases Perth Mint’s minting excellence, being produced from 1 oz. of .999 fine silver in high relief proof quality.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The coins depict the famous Australian inhabitants: a kangaroo resting on its haunches, a koala walking along a eucalyptus branch and a kookaburra perched on a fence. The reverse sides also contain the name of the coin, the mintmark and the year of issue. Also, both the reverse and obverse sides of each coin are struck on concave surfaces to assure their exquisite high relief and proof finish.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-813" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016-australian-high-relief-silver-proof-three-coin-collection.jpg" alt="2016-australian-high-relief-silver-proof-three-coin-collection" width="750" height="300" />

<b>5</b><b>th</b><b> issue in the adorable Cubs series – Lynx Cubs 2016 ½ Silver Proof Coin</b>

This superb feline has tufts of black hair on its ears, a short, stubby tail and a thick fur that keeps it warm during freezing winters. The previous silver coins issued within the series featured the tiger, jaguar, snow leopard and white lion and all of them are offered in a special customized case. The Perth Mint also offers an elegant presentation box to display all of the five illustrated coin cases.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>The 2017 $1 Australian Citizenship Coin</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This outstanding aluminum bronze coin features on its reverse side the Australian Commonwealth Coat of Arms – a shield displaying the badges of the six States of the Commonwealth. The shield is enclosed by an ermine border signifying the Australian Federation in 1901 and its representation is encircled by the words “Australian Citizenship.”</span>

&nbsp;

<b>The new 2017 lunar rooster coin editions</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Perth Mint offers three exceptional keepsakes for the lunar series enthusiasts and, also, perfect gifts for people born under the rooster sign: the 2017 1 oz. Year of the Rooster Silver Proof High Relief Coin, the 2017 1 oz. Silver Gilded Year of the Rooster Coin and the adorable 2017 ½ oz. Baby Rooster Silver Proof Coin.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The high relief proof edition of the 1 oz. Silver Year of the Rooster coin is minted on a beautiful concave surface that enhances its exquisite high relief and proof finish. This sensational coin is made from 1 troy ounce of .9999 fine silver and has a limited mintage of just 7,500 pieces. The silver gilded version has a maximum mintage limit of 50,000 coins and is made from 1 oz. of 99.99% silver, depicting a 24-Karat gold gilded rooster. Both of these fantastic coins carry the same reverse design as the bullion and proof version – the rooster with its three chicks and a hen standing amongst a field of flowers and bamboo, followed by the ‘P’ mintmark, the Chinese character for ‘rooster’ and the engraving ‘Year of the Rooster.’</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Perth Mint also delights its collectors with an excellent gift for any baby born in 2017 – the ½ oz. Baby Rooster Silver Proof Coin. This lovely 1 oz. .999 fine silver coin is issued with a mintage limit of just 7,500 coins and celebrates the Chinese ‘Year of the Rooster’ by displaying on its reverse side a colorful baby rooster against a backdrop of flowers. This cute image is surrounded by the Chinese character for ‘rooster,’ the inscription ‘Year of the Rooster’, and the year of issue, weight and purity of the coin.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These thrilling coins are offered in a classic black presentation case, but the gilded version is also available for collectors encapsulated and in a special case for displaying the full 12 lunar coins set.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">**</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The obverse sides of all the Perth Mint coins portray the famous effigy of Queen Elizabeth II, created by Ian Rank-Broadley, which is surrounded by the coin’s denomination, size and purity inscriptions, and the “Australia” engraving (except for the lynx cubs and baby rooster coins which contain the “Tuvalu” lettering).</span>

&nbsp;

		<title>US Dollar and Gold Continue Positive Correlation</title>
		<content><![CDATA[The positive correlation we were monitoring last week between the US dollar and the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> has become even more pronounced since the last update. The US dollar, as measured by the Dollar Index, has continued to rise toward medium-term resistance on the charts near the 100 level. Meanwhile, gold is refusing to break down below its recent low of $1,243 set on October 7.

These time periods in which both the US dollar and gold move in the same direction are rare, but not unheard of altogether. They tend to happen during one of two main scenarios:

1) Market panics -- when both assets are viewed as safe-havens, and rise simultaneously (or after the panic ends, when both fall simultaneously).

2) At major inflection points -- when one market is advancing, but the other market does not "believe" the legitimacy of the other market's move.

We see no panic in the stock or currency markets recently, so it appears that as of today, it is gold which is not believing the US dollar's continued advance.

The update below continues from our chart last week, and shows both <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and the US dollar since the recent gold low of $1,243 on October 7 (UUP is the proxy ETF for the US dollar index, GLD the proxy for gold):

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-824" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_UUP-GLD-october-2016.png" alt="uup-gld-october-2016" width="641" height="425" />

&nbsp;

In the absence of a market panic, this simultaneous movement by both gold and the US dollar in the same direction will not last forever.

One of these markets will soon be proven "wrong".

Should the dollar continue to advance toward the 100 level while gold remains firm, the precious metal will be signaling that the dollar is due to put in its final medium-term top of the nearly 2-year consolidation shown below, before the next reversal should take it below 92 into 2017:

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-825" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/b_USD-index.png" alt="usd-index-october-2016" width="1240" height="737" />

&nbsp;

However, should the dollar advance above 100 in a meaningful way, we would need to monitor the action in gold closely, as it could represent a major headwind for the precious metals market for at least the next year.

As of present gold continues to show little respect for the dollar's advance.

Note that on the chart above, the RSI indicator (top section) has once again approached the overbought level above 70, which has marked previous tops in the dollar to within a few weeks through 2015.

Because the dollar is approaching important long-term resistance, we will continue to show the dollar/gold relationship on a regular basis over the coming months. Especially with the possibility of a Fed interest rate hike before the New Year, and with the US election only two weeks away -- the major currency markets are primed for trend-setting action through December.

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Gold Update</u></strong>

As of the New York COMEX close on Friday afternoon, gold had gained $12.20 for the week or nearly 1%, to close at $1,267.70.

Looking ahead, initial resistance will be showing up in the former support zone which was broken during the early October decline, between $1,285 and $1,305. With a high probability, we expect buyers will need at least two distinct attempts to break through this resistance level.

For support, we are looking for gold to continue stabilizing above or within the zone of $1,200 - $1,251, shown below in the green band. If gold can maintain the recent October 7 low of $1,243 as the bottom for this correction, it will be setting up a bullish posture to overcome the declining long-term downtrend (magenta color) as early as December, and at latest by March.

We continue to believe the overcoming of this long-term downtrend will represent a major shifting point in the psychology of the precious metals market, and should precede a significant dollar-negative event by 6-12 months.

We note that the RSI indicator (top of chart) had become the most oversold since just prior to the December 2015 bottom. In a bull market, RSI readings below 30 generally signify medium-term bottoms, although this does not preclude the possibility of further time needed within the support zone over the coming months.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

*****

As the US election is just over two weeks away, during the next two weeks we will have increased commentary on how the election results may impact the markets, most notably the US stock market, and of course the precious metals.

		<title>Introducing  PAMP Suisse 1 oz Rhodium Bar at Bullion Exchanges.</title>
		<content><![CDATA[Bullion Exchanges recently made a special arrangement with <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/private-mints/pamp-suisse">PAMP Suisse</a> to be the first retail on the bullion market, offering this unique 1 oz PAMP Suisse Rhodium Bar .999 Fine.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-830" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-oz-PAMP-Suisse-Rhodium-Bar-front.jpg" alt="1-oz-pamp-suisse-rhodium-bar-front" width="900" height="900" />

&nbsp;

Rhodium is one of the most expensive and valued precious metals, which can cost ten times as much as gold or even more. Although rhodium is generally not advised as a practical material, because it’s very difficult to “make it work” properly for bullion craftsmanship, rhodium is absolutely fabulous metal for ingots mintage, because of its luminous, glittering, white and mirror-like characteristics. Rhodium has the highest reflectance among the precious metals. This rare metal was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston, an English chemist. He isolated rhodium from a sample of platinum that was obtained in South America. For this reason, rhodium is classified as a member of the platinum group of metals (ruthenium, palladium, osmium, iridium). Most of the rhodium sold in the United States is used to make alloys. This silvery-white transition metal can enhance the appearance and longevity of any metal to which it was applied.

PAMP bars are always sold out at the first release days because this brand is recognized and considered as a leading independent refinery by traders and investors all across the globe. Accredited by the Swiss Federal Bureau, PAMP Suisse bars are individually registered and sealed in Assay holders which guarantee the fineness and content of the product. Made in Switzerland since 1979, PAMP bars are the most highly sought ingots on the precious metals market.

1 oz PAMP Suisse Rhodium Bar is minted using the highest Swiss engineering skills and the latest manufacturing technologies of the prestigious PAMP Suisse. Its fantastic design and rare metal content make this bar wildly demanded and highly collectible. As other PAMP bars, this rhodium ingot is housed in an Assay card, certifying its .999 Fine purity, the weight of 1 troy ounce, and high quality. PAMP Suisse’s technological advances and bars design set them apart from them other bars in industry. The PAMP Suisse bars feature the image of Lady Fortuna, a Roman goddess who brings people good luck and fortune. A timeless symbol of luck, chance, and fate, Lady Fortuna had a crucial part in the Roman religion. She is usually depicted holding a cornucopia from which all good things are coming, but also blind, which means good luck does not always reach those who seem to deserve it.

		<title>2017 Chinese Silver Pandas now available at Bullion Exchanges</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/coins/chinese-silver-coins/silver-pandas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese Silver Panda Coins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of the most eagerly awaited numismatic issues, is now added to Bullion Exchanges comprehensive selection of coins. Its release date is October 28</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (available in US in mid-December), announced by the People’s Bank of China, along with the official 2017 design of the coin – a lovely panda bear sitting down a bamboo background and eating a bamboo branch.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-851" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2017-Chinese-Silver-Panda-coins.jpg" alt="2017-chinese-silver-panda-coins" width="900" height="900" /></span>

&nbsp;

<b>Get your stunning </b><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/2017-30-gram-chinese-silver-panda-bu"><b>2017 Chinese Silver Panda</b></a><b> from Bullion Exchanges!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduced in 1982 (first gold coin) and 1983 (first silver coin), the Chinese Panda program is one of the most highly anticipated series on the precious metals market. Coin enthusiasts and numismatists all over the world are anxiously waiting for each coin release due to their unique reverse designs that depict a new panda image each year (except for the 2001 and 2002 that share the same design).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The People’s Bank of China has announced that the silver pandas will be available as of  the 28</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of October, yet the coins will reach the US bullion market close to mid-December. The bank also announced this year’s design of the reverse side of the coin – a single panda eating a bamboo branch while sitting down on a bamboo background. This lovely image is surrounded by the face value of the coin, as well as its purity and weight. The 2017 reverse image is reminiscent of the 2015-coin edition, which contains the same elements but displayed from an opposite perspective. Some sources state that this year’s design is courtesy of a new mint designer, but this information is yet to be confirmed.</span>

		<title>2017 brings the 1st Silver, Platinum, and new Gold Krugerrand Sizes</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, the South African Government celebrates the 50</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anniversary of the first ever gold bullion coin in the world – the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/catalogsearch/result/?cat=0&amp;q=2017+krugerrands"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold Krugerrand</span></a>. To commemorate 50 years of excellence in producing this stunning gold coin, the South African Mint will release several exceptional world premieres: the first 1 oz. Silver Krugerrand (released on December 5th, 2016), the first 1 oz. Proof Platinum Krugerrand and the first 50 oz., 5 oz., 1/20 oz., and 1/50 oz. Proof Gold Krugerrand.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">**</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1967, the 1 oz. Gold Krugerrand was released to promote the </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/south-african"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South African gold</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and help it establish as an international investment vehicle. Today, the name Gold Krugerrand is the renowned worldwide symbol for investing in gold. However, the year 2017 will give you several new reasons to associate this prestigious name with the most exclusive and astounding coin releases on the bullion market:</span>

&nbsp;

<b>The first 1 oz. Silver Krugerrand</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Enthusiast numismatists of the series have been waiting for a long time for the Krugerrand silver edition to debut. Over this period, many counterfeit silver Krugerrands have been confusing collectors that this coin exists. Finally, in 2017, The Silver Krugerrand became a reality, being also the first Krugerrand that carries an actual face value of 1 Rand. The coin showcases the same obverse and reverse designs of the original gold coin, created by Otto Schultz and Coert Steynberg, except for the content inscription and the small privy stamp with the encircled “50” engraving. The South African Mint will issue the first 1 oz. Silver Krugerrand from .999 pure silver, available in two versions: Premium Uncirculated, available from December 5th, 2016, (having a higher quality than the common Bullion Uncirculated), with a limited mintage of 500,000 coins, and Proof, with an issue limit of 15,000 coins.</span>

<img class="wp-image-856 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-oz.-Silver-Krugerrand-coin.jpg" alt="1-oz-silver-krugerrand-coin" width="750" height="750" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, a few of these coins will be included in some mint’s anniversary sets. The first <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-south-africa-1-oz-silver-krugerrand-bu">1 oz. Silver Krugerrand</a> will be a fantastic addition, highly awaited by investors and collectors around the world for 50 years.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>The first 1 oz. Proof Platinum Krugerrand</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The brand-new Silver Krugerrand is not the only anniversary achievement from the South African Mint. In 2017, the mint will also issue the very first <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-south-africa-1-oz-platinum-krugerrand-proof">1 oz. Proof Platinum Krugerrand Coin</a>. The 1,967 proof .9999 fine platinum coins with a 10 Rand face value will represent the mint’s unique commitment to celebrating the year when this famous coin was released for the first time - 1967. The coins will feature the same design as the original Krugerrands, except for the content engraving, and are expected to be highly collectible.</span>

<img class="wp-image-859 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2017-1-oz.-Proof-Platinum-Krugerrand-coin.jpg" alt="2017-1-oz-proof-platinum-krugerrand-coin" width="750" height="750" />

&nbsp;

<b>The first 50 oz., 5 oz., 1/20 oz., and 1/50 oz. Proof Gold Krugerrands</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The South African Ministry of Finance authorized the production of the 50 oz., 5 oz., 1/20 oz., and 1/50 oz. Gold Krugerrands – the biggest and smallest Krugerrands in history. These wonderful coins will be struck from .9167 pure gold, yet will contain their exact engraved amount of pure gold, just like all </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/south-african/gold-kruggerand"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold Krugerrands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The coins will display the same design and will have a limited issue of 50,000 coins for 1/50 oz., 20,000 coins for 1/20 oz., 500 coins for 5 oz., and just 50 coins for the 50 oz. size. The last coin size is a huge sensation, having a 4” diameter and over 1.6 kg in weight, being the special 50</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-anniversary edition of the Gold Krugerrand. The mint will also issue the standard </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-south-africa-1-oz-gold-krugerrand-bu-50th-annv-privy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 oz. coin with a special 50th anniversary privy mark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<img class="size-full wp-image-858 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/50-oz.-5-oz.-120-oz.-and-150-oz.-Proof-Gold-Krugerrands.jpg" alt="50-oz-5-oz-120-oz-and-150-oz-proof-gold-krugerrands" width="600" height="350" />

&nbsp;

<b>The South African Mint</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The official mint of the Republic of South Africa has over 100 years of experience in producing high-quality circulation and commemorative coins. The South African Mint was founded in 1886 by Paul Kruger in Pretoria and was run by the British Royal Mint up until 1941. Starting from 1961, the mint produces the country’s official currency and the most renowned </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gold bullion coin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highly praised by investors all over the world – the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-south-africa-1-oz-gold-krugerrand-bu">Gold Krugerrand</a>.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>The History of Gold Krugerrands</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/catalogsearch/result/?cat=0&amp;q=2017+krugerrands"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold Krugerrands</span></a> were the first gold bullion coins designed to be a convenient way of owning some of the South African gold. The first Gold Krugerrand coin was struck by the South African Mint on the 3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of July 1967 from 22K gold, yet contained exactly 1 oz. pure gold – a trademark of the mint’s excellence. Today, the term “Krugerrand” is known by millions of investors around the world. The coin’s name was inspired by the renowned South African President, Paul Kruger, and the country’s monetary currency – Rand. The obverse design of the coin was based on the ZAR (Zuid Afrikaansche Republiek) coin, also known as the Kruger Pond, which depicted the profile portrait of President Kruger. On the reverse side of the coin is engraved the stunning image of a prancing Springbok, the iconic African antelope. In 1980, the mint added three new fractional sizes: 1/10 oz., ¼ oz. and ½ oz. Each of these coins contains the exact amount of gold. Therefore, their weight is a little higher due to the additional content of copper. As the first gold bullion coin in the world, the Gold Krugerrand was an instant success on the bullion market and continues to be one of the most popular collectibles in the world.</span>

		<title>Americans Wary of Both Candidates - How Will Markets Respond?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[The US election is only eight days away, and the race has tightened over the last week. While Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton remains ahead in most polls, Republican candidate Donald Trump has recently taken the lead in key swing states such as Florida and Ohio.

Our general stance on the election is largely agnostic. We are not hugely fond of either candidate. Trump certainly would be a wild-card should he be elected, while Clinton would likely remain more tied to the existing political establishment, continuing the general trajectory of most of Obama's initiatives of the last eight years.

Yet from our viewpoint, it is not so much which candidate ends up winning the election, but rather the recent polls showing Americans' negative sentiment toward both candidates which is most noteworthy.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone wp-image-865 size-full" title="clinton-trump-unfavorable-rating" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_clinton-trump-unforable-rating.png" alt="a_clinton-trump-unfavorable-rating" width="650" height="596" />

&nbsp;

Indeed, polls released this week show that <strong>for the first time ever, the majority of Americans view both candidates as "unfavorable".</strong> (Note: the most recent percentages are now higher than even the chart above shows, at 52.4% unfavorable rating for Clinton and 59.1% for Trump.)

The level of distrust amongst Americans toward their politicians is at an all-time high.

As a corollary, it is fascinating to note that Americans' trust of the mass media is also now at multi-decade lows. The most recent 2016 poll from Gallup shows that the percentage of Americans who have "trust and confidence" in what they are told from mainstream news outlets has fallen to just 32%.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/b_Americans-trust-mass-media-chart.png" alt="b_americans-trust-mass-media-chart" width="600" height="370" />

&nbsp;

Something unprecedented is happening here both politically and culturally. This is at least one reason to hold some physical precious metals outside the banking system, regardless of what happens to the prices in the near term.

&nbsp;

<strong>Markets and Elections</strong>

Historically speaking, since 1900 the data we have available does show that democratic Presidents correspond to better performances in the broad stock market over their terms in office, statistically higher than the performance seen with republican Presidents, as shown in the chart below.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-867" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/c_DJIA-stock-market-change-president.png" alt="c_djia-stock-market-change-president" width="1067" height="1136" />

&nbsp;

However, correlation certainly does not equal causation.

For example, the data does not take into account the myriad of other factors that could have impacted the market averages over these years, such as central bank policies, debt accumulation due to war, or the bursting of market bubbles.

The data is also only expressed in nominal terms. When inflation-adjusted or priced in gold, the data would reveal quite different results.

We also know that there are delays as new policies work their way into an economy. Could higher stock market performances in certain years came as a result of policies implemented in prior administrations?

We cannot know any of this for certain. What we can do is observe the correlation and attempt to decipher what it will mean going forward: democrats do tend to see better stock market performances during their years in office.

&nbsp;

<strong>The Election and Precious Metals</strong>

Turning our attention to precious metals and the election outcome, let us first consider the above-mentioned factor concerning higher stock prices under democratic Presidents. Because stocks and gold are often (but not always) counter-cyclical assets, broadly speaking we can surmise that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> should be expected to perform better under a republican President.

We can observe that the two most significant bull markets in precious metals over the last 50 years began under two republican Presidents: the 1971 - 1980 advance of 2,400% in gold began under republican President Nixon, and the 2001 - 2011 advance of 760% in gold began under President Bush II.

Yet we must recall that the seeds of these precious metals bull markets were sown in the years prior to the republicans taking office, as unsustainable debt and currency depreciation during the prior years eventually forced a revaluation higher in the world's ultimate monetary reserve: gold.

Again, just as we are hesitant to give sole credit to democrats for outperformance of the stock market, we cannot give sole credit to republicans for outperformance of the gold market.

&nbsp;

<strong>The Brexit Effect</strong>

In the coming election, a Trump victory would clearly be a wild-card outcome, as it is not something seen likely in current electoral polls.

Essentially, we believe most markets are siding with the polls and "pricing in" a Clinton victory.

However, markets -- and polls -- are not always correct.

As we saw in Britain with the June Brexit decision in which polls prior to the vote still hinted that the UK would not leave the EU, markets can indeed be fooled.

Since a Clinton victory is already priced in, a Trump surprise win would be a shock for most major stock and currency markets.

As such, we contend that a surprise Trump victory might cause a spike in gold similar to the $110 intraday surge seen on June 24 as votes were being tallied in Britain. Yet this time, the gold spike, should the markets get this surprise, would come not from a falling British pound, but instead from a falling US dollar and/or US stock market.

&nbsp;

<strong>How Will Americans Express Their Distrust?</strong>

No matter who ends up winning the American election on November 8, the most critical trend to follow is the general population that now distrusts <em>both</em> primary candidates and also the mainstream media.

To use the analogy of the popular game, there are not too many dominos that need to fall between the majority of Americans distrusting their government leaders, and at least a portion of those Americans deciding to vote with their wallets and to buy a modest allotment of <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> or <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>.

If you can't trust the President, and you can't trust the media, who can you trust?

It is estimated that still today, only 1% of Americans own any precious metals whatsoever.

Can we begin to fathom what would happen to prices if that percentage were to double, to say 2%? What if 10% of Americans wanted to have 10% of their net worth in gold and silver?

The fundamentals behind this sort of movement into the only asset outside of government control are as strong as they could possibly be. The key question remains timing. It is still early in this cycle. When will more people wake up?

		<title>The 2016 Walking Liberty Centennial Gold Coin - released in November</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last autumn month brings you the 3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coin - the </span><b>2016 Walking Liberty Half Dollar Centennial Gold Coin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - completing the highly anticipated </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins/us-commemorative-coins/2016-centennial"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centennial series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the US Mint. Commemorating 100 years since the coin’s first mintage, this gorgeous anniversary edition will be offered for sale on November 17</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at 12 noon ET and is expected to sell out quickly, as the previous issues of the series.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-874" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-1-2-oz-Walking-Liberty-Centennial-Gold-Coin-1916-2016-100th-Anniversary.jpg" alt="2016-1-2-oz-walking-liberty-centennial-gold-coin-1916-2016-100th-anniversary" width="800" height="700" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Celebrating 100 years of excellence in the mintage of three iconic 1916 designs, the </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/government-mints/us-mint"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Mint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued the following 2016 renditions of the highly regarded coins:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/2016-1-10-oz-mercury-dime-centennial-gold-coin-100th-anniversary-w-box-coa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury Dime Centennial Gold Coin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (April)</span></li>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/2016-1-2-oz-walking-liberty-centennial-100th-anniversary-w-box-coa"><b>The Walking Liberty Half Dollar Centennial Gold Coin</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (available on 17</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> November)</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of these highly anticipated gold collectibles are treasured additions for any numismatist due to their legendary design struck with exceptional craftsmanship by the US Mint professionals. These splendid gold coins have borrowed the original designs of the 1916 circulating coins, honoring the remarkable work of their creators and refining them with stunning business strike finishes.</span>

<img class="wp-image-878 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-1-2-oz-Walking-Liberty-Centennial-Gold-Coin-back.jpg" alt="2016-1-2-oz-walking-liberty-centennial-gold-coin-1916-2016-100th-anniversary" width="800" height="700" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the reverse and obverse sides of the coin showcase the basic design of the iconic Walking Liberty minted from 1916 to 1947 and reconstituted on the extremely popular American Silver Eagle coin, produced from 1986. The images are courtesy of the famous American sculptor, Adolph A. Weinman, whose “W” initial has been added to the coin’s head (one of the few differences between the centennial and original coins). On the obverse side is engraved the graceful full-length figure of Lady Liberty, displayed in full stride and enveloped in the United States flag’s folds. She is depicted as holding branches of laurel and oak in her left hand and having her right arm extended, encircled by the engravings “Liberty”, “In God We Trust”, and “2016”.  On the reverse side is represented the majestic American eagle which is rising from a top perch of a mountain, framed by the inscriptions “Half Dollar”, “E Pluribus Unum”, “United States of America”, along with the “W” mintmark, purity and weight of the coin (another unique feature of the anniversary edition).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This astonishing coin will be re-struck at the US Mint West Point Facility from ½ troy ounce of 99.99% pure (24 Karat) gold and will come with business strike finish and reeded edge. The half-ounce size is representative to the centennial coin’s denomination of half a dollar. The 2016 Walking Liberty Half Dollar Centennial Gold Coin has a limited mintage of just 70,000 pieces (lower than the limits for the previous centennial coin issues) and a 3-coin household order limit. Each coin will be individually encapsulated and displayed by the mint in a hand-packed and custom-designed elegant black matte hardwood presentation case which will contain the coin’s Certificate of Authenticity.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-879" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-half-oz-Walking-Liberty-Centennial-Gold-Coin-with-Box.jpg" alt="2016-half-oz-walking-liberty-centennial-gold-coin-with-box" width="800" height="700" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first centennial edition – the 2016 Mercury Dime Gold Coin – sold out in less than one hour and the mint offers only a few of the 2016 Standing Liberty Quarter Centennial Gold Coins. The low issue of the centennial Walking Liberty promises that this thrilling coin will also be a sought-after keepsake, so don’t miss your chance to own the last issue of the series.</span>

		<title><![CDATA[Gold & Silver Technical Updates. The Presidential Election]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[With no change announced to interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve meeting this week, the markets instead focused mostly on the upcoming <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/10/31/americans-wary-candidates-how-will-markets-respond/">US election</a>. Polls continued to show the gap between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton narrowing, now to 1.6%. The correlation between gold and Trump's poll odds has been striking over the last two weeks... and one way or another, the question as to who will lead the United States for the next four years will be decided this Tuesday.
<h2>Gold</h2>
In sum, gold rose this week by $27 to close at $1,304, a gain of 2.2% from a week prior.

As emotions can become extreme at such critical fundamental crossroads, we find it useful to return our attention at these moments to the charts for what is always the primary driver for the entire precious metals complex: the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">price of gold</a>.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-887" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Gold-price-elections.png" alt="gold-price-elections" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

The language of the charts shows us that gold is now directly hitting up against the upper boundary of the broken support zone which held it higher from June through early October, at $1,305.

It would be rare for a market to break down from such a support zone (as happened in October) and then recover it on the first attempt higher, so we would expect to see gold back off in this region, and spend more weeks consolidating between the support established in at $1,245 and the recent high of $1,305. This would then set gold up to make a second attempt to break $1,305 later this year or early 2017. This is what markets "should" do from a technical perspective.

However, a Trump victory would certainly be one of those fundamental triggers that could cause a major breakout on the chart pattern prior to our typical expectation.

For now, we will have to step back and watch the outcome this week. The trading on Tuesday should be fascinating to observe. Whether it is sooner or later, the support and resistance zones that will define the next stages of gold's trajectory are clearly defined, and the most important question we continue to monitor is: "When will gold break its long-term downtrend?"

That break is going to coincide with a fundamental spark that will reveal itself just at the right time. Again, the charts can give us great insight into "what" is happening... the "why" always remains to be seen.

&nbsp;
<h2>Silver</h2>
Silver finished higher for the week by $0.58 cents to close at $18.37, a gain of 3.2%, although well off the high of $18.75 hit on Wednesday.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-888" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Silver-price-elections.png" alt="silver-price-elections" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

As we can see above, silver got stopped in its tracks just above $18.50, the former support seen in late August. From a technical perspective over the short term, $18.50 matches very closely with the $1,305 resistance in gold. A break and sustained close of either of these levels by either metal would give us a strong indication of a breakout to come in the other.

Strong support for <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver price</a> exists between $17.00 and $17.40.

The critical test for silver is that we observe when it breaks the downtrend shown above in blue. We continue to believe <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> will break this trend line within the same timeframe as gold's break of its long-term downtrend (magenta color, page 1).

<strong> </strong>

<strong>A Note on the Fed Statement</strong>

As referenced above, the Fed meeting was generally a non-event this week. However, the language used by the Fed in the non-decision strongly hinted that a second rate hike is due to come, perhaps as early as December:

"<em>Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. </em><strong><em>The Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives</em></strong><em>. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."</em>

This point bears repeating, as the misinformation from the mainstream media is constant and is repeated in almost every major Fed interest rate article: throughout history rising interest rates have corresponded with rising gold prices, not the opposite, as the mainstream press often states.

What we are now witnessing is the very beginning of the <u>slowest</u> rate-hike cycle the Fed has ever engaged in.

Typically over the last 70 years during rate hike cycles, the Fed would raise 0.25% every meeting over the course of 3-5 years. Such was the case, for example, from 2003-2007 as the Fed raised rates from 1% to 5.25% in 0.25% increments, every 6-12 weeks.

Yet during the current cycle, the Fed has raised rates only <u>once</u>, and it has now paused for a full year since that singular rate hike in December 2015. This is the only time in history the Fed has raised rates once, and then paused for the next year. We are witnessing a slow-motion collision course between unsustainable debt levels that cannot afford higher interest rates, and a wave of inflation that is already working its way into various segments of the economy.

Newton's Third Law says: "For every action there is an opposite and equal reaction." The unprecedented interest rate policy we are living through is going to have unprecedented consequences, it is only a question of timing.

		<title><![CDATA[Trump's Unexpected Victory, Markets Reverse Course]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Donald Trump clinched an unexpected victory for the US Presidential election on Tuesday, which sent major world markets into a temporary panic.  Gold surged, stocks dropped limit-down in the overnight hours, and it appeared gold was on the verge of the technical breakout from the long-term downtrend that we have been monitoring for almost half a year now.

Yet just 12 hours after the election results became known, the markets saw quick reversals of the prior movements, with precious metals and other safety assets being dumped, and risk assets including broad stocks and industrial commodities being bought strongly.

We remain long-term bullish on precious metals for the fundamental reasons that we all know to be true: central bank money printing, government bailouts of private corporations, uncontrollable debt, and negative interest rates in several major nations worldwide.

Yet the challenge at this moment is to come back to a central investment principle: do not fight the market.

What this means is that, as individuals and investors, we may have opinions on what the market should do. We may have fundamental data from sound research to back up those opinions. We may have done thorough due diligence. Yet despite all this, if the market moves opposite to our fundamental research, we must consider that there is more information impacting the market than we are factoring into our equations.

The old investment adage is helpful to remember: "The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."
<h2>Markets Turn After Trump's Victory</h2>
Immediately in the aftermath of the Trump election victory, most major world markets reversed course abruptly and strongly.

Gold and silver, which were up significantly in the hours after Trump's win was decided, reversed suddenly and finished lower for the week. Gold hit a high of $1,335 in the early morning hours on Wednesday, only to close the week near $1,225, almost a $110 drop in just over 48 hours.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-903" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a_TrumpVictory-stocks-dollar-gold-silver.jpg" alt="trump-victory-stocks-dollar-gold-silver" width="1500" height="1125" />

&nbsp;

Similarly, the US dollar and the US stock market, which were showing 2.5% and 5% losses in the overnight hours after the election, reversed course and both finished higher by over 1%, respectively. These are notable intra-week swings.

But it was not only gold and precious metals that fell after the initial surge on Tuesday night. Long-term 20+ year US bonds also dropped, falling over 6% in the last three trading days of the week. This is a huge drop for the bond market, to the extent that 20-year interest rates rose from 2.26% to 2.58% in just one week. This is one of the largest single-week drops in bond prices / increase in bond interest rates seen in the last 20 years.

In sum, after the initial fear reaction as a result of Trump's victory, most major markets did a 180-degree turn and reversed. Safety assets were sold across the board, and risk assets recovered to turn positive.

Let us switch the above chart to view the action in metals only. We are including both precious and industrial metals in the following chart.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-904" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b_Trump-Victory-precious-Metals.jpg" alt="trump-victory-precious-metals" width="1500" height="1125" />

&nbsp;

First, we see that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-copper">copper</a> was the outstanding performer this week, indicating demand for the industrial metals was seen as positive after the Trump election. <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">Palladium</a> came in second, which is, of course, a precious metal with major industrial demand, especially from the automotive industry.

In contrast, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> all fell, the first two being the historic monetary metals.

It appears that markets are pricing in increased industrial demand from the Trump administration and a lesser need for safety assets. We can only speculate as to the reasons for this -- we wonder (half-jokingly): is the wall that Trump intends to build along the US-Mexico border going to be made primarily of copper?

Silver is the outlier. As we know, silver's demand equation still is composed of roughly 80% industrial usage. Why did silver fall more than gold, and not finish the week somewhere in between gold and copper (as it "should" when safety assets fall but industrial assets rise)? What happened to the industrial silver buyers?

Manipulation theories aside (we do not completely discount them, but do not consider them sufficient for making investment decisions), based on the declines seen in US bonds, gold, and platinum, we can only conclude that silver saw large selling from those who were previously holding the metal for its safety / monetary role. We may not agree with their decision to sell, but sell is what they did.

A quick view of the copper chart from 2010 through present reveals the significance of the surge seen in the primary-industrial metal this week: no less than a breakout from the long-term declining trendline since the 2011 highs. [Note: this is the same relative trendline that has been so elusive for gold, from which it has failed to break higher for the past five months. From the copper surge seen this week it should be apparent why we place emphasis on the potential breaking of these long-term trends.]

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-905" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/c_Copper-spot-price-elections.png" alt="copper-spot-price-elections" width="1067" height="799" />

&nbsp;

In sum, copper was up an incredible 10.7% for the week and looks like it is entering a new bull market after five years of declines.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold Analysis</h2>
For the week, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price per ounce</a> fell $80 or 6.1% to finish at $1,224. Yet more significant was the nearly $110 swing from $1,335 on Wednesday to the Friday close.

<strong>The Wednesday reversal consisted of the highest ever single-day volume of contracts traded on the New York COMEX exchange, at 780,000.</strong> This is nearly four times the average daily volume.

Because this historic volume occurred on a reversal day, the $1,335 high is going to require multiple attempts or an equally-high record-breaking volume surge to break through this level on any subsequent rally.

Viewing gold technically, the metal is making a lower low within the strong support zone that we would expect to hold if gold is still in a new bull market. This zone extends down to $1,200, precisely.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-906" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/d_gold-spot-price-elections.png" alt="d_gold-spot-price-elections" width="1125" height="843" />

&nbsp;

The "Must Hold Zone", as defined by $1,173, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the advance, would be the lowest level that we have observed new bull markets to fall while still being in a primary overall advance. A break below that level and quick retests of $1,045 would occur at minimum.

		<title>Dollar Surges, Bonds Fall in Trump Aftermath</title>
		<content><![CDATA[In the wake of the Trump election, the US dollar has broken out higher from the two-year consolidation that we have been watching now for many months. Held between the 92 support level and the 100 resistance zone since the beginning of 2015, the dollar hit a high of 101.5 last week, decisively breaking through the aforementioned resistance.

This is important to monitor because over the short and intermediate-term, the precious metals often move counter to the value of the US dollar. (Over the long run, we can clearly observe that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is rising regardless of fluctuations in the US dollar versus other world currencies. More on this below.)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The target for a successful breakout of this nature is derived as equal to the amplitude of the prior consolidation. The fundamental reason for this target is that an equal number of trapped short-sellers who placed their bets during the consolidation are likely to cover their shorts as the breakout advances, thus driving the dollar higher. The prior consolidation featured an 8 point amplitude (100 - 92). Thus, we expect the US dollar to advance to approximately 108 on the index over the next 6-12 months.

If <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> were to fall below $1,200 and toward the 2015 lows of $1,045 again, it would be because paper traders are reacting to this advance now setting up in the dollar.

Longer term, let us never forget that an attempt to determine what the price of gold will be at a given value of the US dollar versus other depreciating currencies is akin to trying to decide which ship is best to stay on amidst the certainty that all ships will sink during an approaching typhoon.

The truth is: all ships will be sinking, just at different rates. Gold is the life raft.

The proof for this can be seen in the long-term view of the <strong>US dollar index versus gold</strong>, where we update the levels at which gold has traded corresponding to the 100 point on the dollar index. Note that since 1980, gold has traded at $700, $275, $375, and $1,200 all while the US dollar has essentially made a round trip back to 100.

As the mainstream media continuously attempts to discredit gold based on movements in the dollar index, it is important that we keep this long-term perspective in mind at all times.

<h2>Bond Selling Continues After Trump Victory</h2>
US bonds continue to see major selling since Trump's victory, to the extent that the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond has seen its interest rate rise from 2.55% to 3.01% since the election.

We have long speculated that the final top to the unprecedented 36-year advance in US bonds was nearing an end. Yet bull markets typically end with a bang and not a whimper, and this backdrop usually takes the form of a bubble during the later stages. Bubbles can be spotted on the charts as a multi-year linear advance becomes parabolic during its later stages.

The selling seen over the last two weeks in the bond market brings this idea to the forefront, as bond prices have hit 152, just touching the parabolic curve (blue on the chart below) that we believe is setting up to mark the bubble-like end of this long-term advance.

The only question is: do bond prices have one final surge higher to go to mark a true mania phase in US paper, or has the top already been put into place?

The two trajectories, one envisioning a final blow-off phase for bonds and one assuming that the top has already been put into place, are outlined in green below.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-916" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/c_US-Bond-price-november-2016.png" alt="us-bond-price-november-2016" width="1064" height="632" />
A determining characteristic of bubbles is that they go on longer and higher than almost anyone can fathom, so whether the final top was just put into place, or whether there needs to be one final surge to new all-time highs in bond prices remains to be seen. What we can say is that most people alive today have never seen a bear market in bond prices during their investment careers -- and now after 36 years of rising, it is equally fathomable that bond prices could see 36 years of selling. The ramifications of this are unimaginable, but due to unprecedented debt levels worldwide, most governments could not withstand interest rates above 5%, let alone rates near 14% or 15%, as were seen during the 1970's and 1980's.

Will governments insist that central banks be their buyers of last resort as legitimate demand for bonds falls in the coming years?

The only source of funding that central banks have for this is the printing press (i.e. electronic equivalent). Future gold prices will thus be largely impacted by the bursting of the bond bubble.

----------

Thursday, November 24 is Thanksgiving here in the United States. Major markets will be closed. There will be a half-day (until 1:00pm) of trading on Friday. In sum, markets should be rather slow starting Wednesday afternoon through the end of the week.

Happy Thanksgiving and enjoy the long weekend ahead!

		<title>Gold: Looking for Double Bottom?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[Let us be very clear: we are bullish on precious metals over the long term. Yet over the intermediate timeframe, the market is giving us signals that the long-term bottoms we are expecting to form may take a more complex path than was originally anticipated. We should stay nimble and be prepared for some twists and turns going forward.

For the last week, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> fell by $30 to close at $1,183 as of the NY COMEX final print, a 2.4% loss for the week. Notably, the low for the week came late Thursday night EST / early Friday morning in Asia, at near $1,171, before bouncing, touching the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement line of the entire December through July advance, and the final "Must Hold" support zone that we have been monitoring for some months.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-938" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a_Gold-price-november-2016.png" alt="gold-price-november-2016" width="1195" height="895" />

&nbsp;

If <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is going to put in a low in this region, it must immediately rise this week above the $1,200 level and maintain a weekly close there. This would turn the break below the $1,200 level into a "false breakdown", and would require us to re-examine the possibility that the next advance is indeed underway. Such fake-outs do occur in all markets periodically, and the only way to identify them is to maintain a close watch of the key support/resistance levels. This is the only scenario in which we could consider the initial advance from 2015 to still be continuing.

However, the bulk of the evidence now in front of us leads to the conclusion that gold will need to at least retest the region of its 2015 lows, if not break below them, as part of a more complex multi-year bottoming formation.

The support below $1,173 is negligible for gold, down to the 2015 lows. Strong support levels are primarily defined by prior periods of consolidative action, and in the case of gold that consolidation took place between $1,200 and $1,305 from February to June. The fact that gold saw little to no buying interest at $1,200 last week indicates those buyers who bought the dips toward $1,200 last spring are no longer participating in the market.

Why are they no longer present? We cannot know. Those buyers were a diverse group of institutions, individuals, and funds from around the world, so we cannot possibly identify a single cause for their sum lack of participation. All we can know is what they (the market) are doing, and align ourselves for the highest probability of success.

Below $1,173, we will next look for a bottom in gold indicated by the new green shading on the chart above, which corresponds to the consolidation seen from November 2015 through early January 2016. This zone of $1,045 - $1,085 is where we would look for the possibility of gold to form a double bottom. The term double bottom is derived precisely because the price reached this level once before, and then comes back to retest (if successful) this level for a second time.

&nbsp;

<strong>Technical Clues for the Next Bottom</strong>

No matter what the exact low price that forms for gold, we will be looking for a specific set of bottoming patterns to come into play. One of the most important bottom indicators will be to watch for a period of outperformance of the mining sector versus the metal itself. As an example, if gold were to fall to $1,045 again, we should expect to see the mining complex bottom several points above its related 2015 lows, as measured either by either the HUI or GDX index.

We will also be looking for a downtrend break in gold, as well as any other number of confirming bottoming patterns: bottoming wedge, inverse head and shoulders, gold outperformance versus CRB commodity index, etc.

These are the bottoming indicators that worked in 2008 as well as 2015, and at least several of them will allow us to target the next bottom as it approaches. Of course, we will not catch the exact bottom to the day -- but the truth is no one will. We will, however, be able to observe the shift in the market for what should be a move equal to, if not greater than, the 2016 initial advance.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>1999 - 2001 Gold Example</strong>

As an example, here is how the last long-term bottom in gold formed, from 1999 - 2001. The pattern featured a support zone between $250 and $265, with an initial advance to $337, a 34% surge that gave back almost all of its gains into the double bottom of 2001. Downtrend breaks were noted in successive fashion in November 2000 and then again in May 2001.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b_Gold-1999-2001-double-bottom.png" alt="gold-1999-2001-double-bottom" width="1177" height="857" />

&nbsp;

For long-term investors, any purchases within the 1999 - 2001 period, even at the $337 peak, were eventually seen to be excellent value once the price of gold exceeded the initial advance in 2002. It then never looked back.

Of course, no two periods in history will match exactly, but the point is that a set of potential patterns exist which tend to define most bottoms, and we fully expect to identify the next one to come.

&nbsp;

<strong>Gold: Looking Forward</strong>

As a working hypothesis, with the expectation of a double bottom to form in gold, we propose the following trajectory for gold over the subsequent two years:

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-940" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/c_Gold-2009-downtrend.png" alt="gold-2009-downtrend" width="1208" height="904" />

&nbsp;

The primary 2013 - 2015 downtrend channel for gold, which was broken in February and shown in light blue, would be set up to act as a second support level for gold near the $1,045 double bottom.

A successful double bottom would then set up gold to challenge its long-term (magenta color) downtrend again in late 2017, with the expectation of a successful breakout either then or in early 2018. By this time, the downtrend would come in much lower, near $1,200. Yet its significance would be no less.

For comparison, we continue to monitor the incredible action taking place in the copper market over the last month. In just four weeks, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">copper</a> has surged 28% to $2.67 per pound.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-941" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/d_Copper-2010-2016.png" alt="copper-2010-2016" width="1203" height="900" />

&nbsp;

A similar 28% percentage gain, should gold break its long-term downtrend next year at $1,200, would result in a surge to $1,536 within four weeks. Such is the type of move we want to be positioned for ahead of time.

		<title>Deutsche Bank Settles in Gold-Fixing Lawsuit</title>
		<content><![CDATA[On Friday, Deutsche Bank agreed to settle privately for antitrust litigation brought against the German bank by traders and investors who accused the company of conspiring to fix <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold prices</a> at their expense.

This case holds special interest to me personally, as I was contacted by the prosecuting counsel and gave testimony to some of the dubious trading patterns I have observed over the years participating in the futures market.

<img class="size-full wp-image-961 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Deutsche-Bank-Gold-Dold-Settlement.jpg" alt="deutsche-bank-gold-settlement" width="600" height="300" />

The preliminary settlement was filed in New York this week, and consists of a $60M package.

This follows a similar settlement the bank agreed to pay in October of $38M for conspiring to fix <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver prices</a>.

It still remains to be seen which classes of traders or investors are eligible to receive compensation from the settlement, and the total payout per individual is unlikely to amount to more than a few hundred dollars.

Further, it should be noted that the combined settlements of $98M represent a tiny fraction of the bank's $47 billion revenue for 2015. So the settlement will have negligible impact on the company.

Deutsche Bank officially denies wrongdoing. However, the fact that the bank is willing to settle the case is unprecedented in and of itself. Here we have, for the first time, a large multi-national bank agreeing to settle for actions related to manipulation of the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/category/precious-metals-investing/">precious metals markets</a>.

With this settlement, it is possible that further class action lawsuits could be brought against Deutsche Bank by other parties in coming years.

Four other banks who were also listed as defendants in the case have not agreed to settle yet: Barclays, Bank of Nova Scotia, HSBC, and Societe Generale. Should the case go to trial, a ruling against these banks could result in much harsher penalties than the $98M Deutsche Bank is paying?

&nbsp;

<strong>Manipulation Theories Go Mainstream</strong>

In years past, theories that banks were attempting to manipulate <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">precious metals prices</a> were considered the realm of conspiracy theorists and dismissed by the mainstream media.

However, it is increasingly clear that the precious metals markets represent a special focal point for many institutions, and attempts to manipulate their values are indeed occurring.

It has long been my contention that such manipulation attempts do occur. However, I also believe that such attempts are not more powerful than the market forces itself. Ultimately, the market will win out, and attempts at suppression will fail. This is a lesson from countless examples throughout history: attempts to suppress a given market only result in that market moving higher once the suppression is overwhelmed.

No matter whether the market action on a given day or week is related to manipulative attempts or to legitimate buying and selling, we should still pay attention to where price signals appear on the charts. Both manipulation and legitimate market action do impact the prices at which we must buy and sell physical metal, as well as the revenues and hence market valuations of the companies that mine for the metals in the ground.

Over the long run, we should not want to be involved with the precious metals if they could be manipulated ad infinitum. The fact that we as investors are here means we must have faith that such suppression will fail and the market forces will seek true values.

Over the next few months, we will continue to monitor the settlement and litigation proceedings of these cases, and report on any actions that individual investors should take on the possibility of reparation payments.

<h2>Italians Vote "No" -- Signals Establishment Discontent</h2>
Early Monday morning, we received reports that Italians have voted "no" on Premier Matteo Renzi's reform referendum, and further reports that Renzi will resign on Monday.

The outcome is generally seen as representing a victory for "anti-establishment" voters. The reform referendum was strongly backed by Italy's corporations, banks, and establishment institutions, so the defeat sends a message that is similar in context to Britain's Brexit vote and Trump's victory here in the US.

<img class="size-full wp-image-962 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Italians-Vote-No-Signals-Establishment-Discontent.jpg" alt="italians-vote-no-signals-establishment-discontent" width="600" height="300" />

Here we see over the last six months three major western nations delivering strong anti-establishment and anti-globalist messages to their politicians.

While the impact to the precious metals markets have been minor in the overnight Asian trading immediately following the vote, clearly, the "wind of change" that is blowing in various corners of the political world is gaining in momentum...

&nbsp;

<strong>A Political to Economic Trend?</strong>

From a dual political/economic standpoint, we cannot help but wonder: when will even a small fraction of those discontented with the current system (and willing to vote against it in an election) connect the dots and vote against the same system even more tangibly by selling the local currency and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">buying gold</a> / <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silve</a> instead? It would not take many of the world's discontented citizens to simply buy a few ounces of silver or a single ounce of gold for the prices to skyrocket to multiples of the current level.

The timing for this scenario remains speculative still, but we can indeed see shifts in sentiment in front of our eyes. One thing is for sure: political systems and their fiat currencies are intrinsically related... and no amount of manipulation from Deutsche Bank or any other institution will be able to hold back the "voting" of the global currency market when it finally moves in favor of gold.

		<title>Gold and Silver Technical Updates. Long-term double bottom scenarios</title>
		<content><![CDATA[Having fallen for five weeks straight since the Trump victory, gold this week broke through its final technical support of the 2016 advance, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the entire surge, at $1,173, so we must now shift our focus toward identifying the next low that is set to come. For the week, gold fell 1.4% to close at $1,159 as of the final electronic trade in New York on Friday.

The intermediate-term 3-year chart is the most helpful perspective at this juncture:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/a_Gold-december-2016.png" alt="gold-price-december-2016" width="1201" height="899" />

&nbsp;

Two weeks ago, we highlighted the example of the 1999-2001 double bottom for gold, and how this might look should the same pattern play out again, 16 years later. Having seen the continued weakness in gold over the last two weeks, let us now focus on some additional specifics.

The 2013 - 2015 downtrend channel, seemingly forgotten last summer, is the next potential whereby gold should attempt to begin carving out a double bottom. For reference, the channel was formed by five separate hits each on the upper and lower trendlines from 2013 onward, as shown above by the red and orange highlight circles on the chart. It was as clear of a trend channel as we could possibly ask for -- and it was broken in February 2016 as gold exceeded $1,190.

Since that trend channel was indeed declining, even though gold has now come back below the $1,190 breakout point, the precious metal still finds itself above the upper boundary of the channel.

Markets often come back to re-test broken lines and channels, and in this case <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> looks to be setting up for that retest within the next 3-4 months.

The retest of the trend channel should correspond, plus or minus a few percentage points, with the low for the 2015 bottom, at $1,045. Typically in long-term double bottom scenarios, the second low will fail to reach the depths of the initial low by several percentage points. <strong>Thus, our <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/11/28/gold-double-bottom/">double bottom</a> potential exists from $1,045 through $1,080, </strong>as shown by the green band above. The possibility of a nominal new low in gold forming alongside a double bottom in the gold mining sector should also not be ruled out.
<h2>Silver Update</h2>
Silver finished the week positive for the second week in a row, up $0.13 or 0.80% to close at $16.97 as of the final COMEX trade in New York.

This was the second week in a row that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver spot price</a> has moved in an opposite direction as gold when viewing the weekly closing prices. Silver outperformance should be noted to be positive relative strength, which has ramifications for the entire sector, and fitting in with our thesis that a complex long-term bottom is forming in the precious metals, even if the absolute lows remain ahead of us.

The rally this week was halted exactly at the broken support-turned-resistance zone shown below by the black line at $17.25. A break above this $17.25 resistance would hint that a short-term bottom is in the process of forming, although we will feel much more comfortable that the larger decline is over when the upper blue downtrend line is broken, which now comes in at $18.45.

		<title>Gold to Silver Ratio Analysis</title>
		<content><![CDATA[As shown on the chart below, the defining characteristic of the decline in gold and silver prices since the July/August highs has been the rising trend in the gold to silver ratio.

Of course, this ratio measures the number of <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">ounces of silver</a> needed to purchase one <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">ounce of gold</a>.

The fall in the gold/silver ratio from above 80 in January to 64 in early July corresponded to the advances in both metals with outperformance by silver. However, the rise in the gold/silver ratio since July from 64 to 68 as both metals have declined has shown only marginal outperformance by gold.

In other words, as a sum, since the beginning of the year, silver has outperformed gold when viewing the entirety of the advance and subsequent retracement.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/gold-silver-ratio-2016.png" alt="gold-silver-ratio-2016" width="1206" height="717" />

&nbsp;

<strong>Silver's 2016 Outperformance in Perspective</strong>

The major gold/silver ratio trend breakdown in April (first red highlight circle) was a defining change in the ongoing pattern, after nearly five years of rising in favor of gold (large turquoise channel).

The initial wave lower in the gold/silver ratio (corresponding with rising metals prices) lasted through September. While this initial wave lower was halted at the end of September, we do not expect the former 2011 - 2016 rising channel to be regained again.

In other words: silver outperformance is likely over a multi-year period ahead, even though it will underperform gold during sometimes lengthy corrections.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Different Strategies for Different Investors</strong>

Of course, each precious metals investor comes to the sector with a different set of goals, a different time horizon, and a different tolerance for risk. Whereas long-term investors may find dollar-cost averaging into the lows to be a helpful strategy, those with a shorter-term time horizon may want to focus on following some of these technical indicators along with us.

Those wanting to hold <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> as "wealth insurance" in case of political or economic turmoil are reminded that the best time to buy an insurance policy is not when it has gone up in price, but when it has come down. And those insurance policies are now some $200 cheaper per ounce than they were in mid-summer.]]></content>

		<title>How a change in Sharia Law can increase a demand for gold?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The prospect of the precious metals market could set an absolutely new path in December 2016 because of the new “Gold standard” in the Sharia law. The financial and personal lives of Muslims are guided by Sharia law, which doesn’t allow to trade gold for the future value, interests or speculation. The gold as a ribawi item can be sold only on weight and measure and used as a jewelry, but not as a prosperity. However, there has been a need for clarification for how gold bullion can be used for investment purposes by Muslims for a long time. Islamic investors have always had access to the gold market through jewelry and coins, this guidance will vastly increase the number and diversity of investment products available.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The possibility of many potential Muslim investors has been limited because this law and it could be a revolutionary change for the precious metals market if the Sharia gold standard will be developed. This upcoming clarification could open the gold market to millions Muslims under Sharia law and also causes a further spike in <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically Islamic financial market has had an important international influence, even the investors have had access to the gold market only through jewelry and coins, this change will let Muslim market become much more powerful. For this reason, it is not a surprise, that, the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) and the World Gold Council have approved a ground-breaking initiative, that will become known as the</span><b> “Sharia Gold Standard”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Islamic world will play an increasingly important role for the gold price demand, which has been structured by Western ideas for a long time. Most people don’t realize how rare gold really is, but the fact is there are only 6.4 billion ounces of aboveground gold on the planet, so millions of the potential new buyers can bring a lot of competition to the market game. Muslim investors will be able to take an advantage of the increasing back of range and bring a lot of competition into the investment world.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sharia-law-gold.jpg" alt="sharia law gold" width="342" height="328" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the global reports in 2015 China was the largest gold buyer (average number of sold gold is 1,000 tons). Since gold has a long history with Muslims -- as a currency and store of wealth -- it's expected Muslim investors will quickly embrace gold investment products such as coins, bars and include gold savings plans, gold certificates, certain gold futures and gold mining stocks in their financial goals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This new law would set a future path for gold products and put a real pressure on metals as they would become more expensive. Due to the general economy situation in the world the most banks have added gold to their reserves since the financial crisis of 2007/2008. But currently there are still two Muslim countries (Turkey and Saudi Arabia) that included in the top 20 of the world’s gold reserve holdings and they will definitely try to get as much value as they can for their fund.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment analytics all around the world announce that it’s not unreasonable to expect a good bump up in the gold prices as soon as Wall Street prepares for the annual Federal Reserve meeting. These last weeks are considered to be very intense and changing for industrial metals dynamic. For this reason, we here at Bullion Exchanges believe this is a really great time to add value to your profitable precious metals portfolio and buy old before it will be additionally appealing on the Muslim market. We offer a great selection of </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold products</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including the latest 2017 releases at low prices. Also, you can go through our selection of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver products</a> f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or being able to diversify your portfolio with the silver bullion and be sure that your collection is secured from all sides and will no longer be under raising prices impact.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Gold in Foreign Currencies - Clues to Gold in US Dollars</title>
		<content><![CDATA[Given the potential for the pending low we are expecting across the precious metals in the next 2-3 months, it is important that we review gold priced in other major world currencies at this juncture.

If gold is going to form a bottom in US dollars, it is going to form concurrent bottoms at different but related key technical zones in other currencies during the same timeframe.

Conversely, if we observe major breakdowns in key technical levels in gold as priced in foreign currencies, it would give us clues that US dollar gold may be heading for new lows.

Although <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold priced in US dollars</a> is the worldwide standard for both trade and mining valuation, the bull market that we are expecting over the coming years is believed to be a worldwide phenomenon. Whereas in the 1970's gold's advance was mostly related to US dollar weakness after President Nixon severed the link to gold, today every currency in the world is fiat, and we have observed the precious metal moving higher over the last decade in multiple currencies.

This situation of not having a single currency backed by <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, in and of itself, is unprecedented, and so we now turn to gold as priced in four other major currencies for perspective on the faith (or lack thereof) other western citizens are placing in their own central bank's regimes.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold in Canadian Dollars (CAD)</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1042 size-full" title="Gold in Canadian Dollars (CAD)" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/a_Gold-in-Canadian-Dollars-CAD.png" alt="a_Gold in Canadian Dollars (CAD)" width="1223" height="727" />

Gold in Canadian dollars hit a high of just over $1,800 over in the summer, with a second attempt to break this level negated following Trump's victory.

Canadian dollar-gold has since given back nearly $300 to close just above $1,515 this week.

The critical technical position of gold in Canadian dollars is evident on the chart above by the long-term (magenta color) trendline that is now being tested. This test represents the second distinct hit on the trendline since breaking the 2011-2014 downtrend in mid-2014 (red callout, above). This trendline dates all the way back to 2005.

We can observe a fairly uniform rising channel having formed since CAD gold bottomed in 2013 at $1,250, with four successive higher highs and four successive higher lows since then.

If gold were to break down through the long-term trendline, it would give us reason for additional caution on US dollar gold.

If gold in US dollars is going to form the interim low we expect in early 2017, gold in Canadian dollars should hold its long-term rising trendline immediately and exceed $1,800 by 2018.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold in British Pounds (GBP)</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1043" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/b_Gold-in-British-Pounds-GBP.png" alt="Gold in British Pounds (GBP)" width="1204" height="715" />

Gold in British pounds had bottomed at £700 in late 2015, before the 2016 advance reached over £1,050 post-Brexit. Since the US election, British pound-gold has given back £150 to close just above £900.

Gold in pounds is now retesting its Brexit breakout point at £900. This is the price below which the metal consolidated for most of 2016 prior to the vote.

From a technical perspective, we would expect to see second-chance buyers in the UK step in between £850 - £900 for an interim low.

If gold in US dollars is to form a double bottom in 2017 and then begin a new bull market, we expect, based on the ongoing weakness across pound sterling exchange rates, that gold in GBP will make new all-time highs as early as 2018.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold in Euros (EUR)</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1044" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/c_Gold-in-Euros-EUR.png" alt="Gold in Euros (EUR)" width="1208" height="718" />

Gold in euros bears many similarities in trajectory to gold in Canadian dollars, yet with the swings in each direction since 2013 showing lesser volatility. Euro-gold bottomed in 2013 at just above €860, broke its downtrend from the 2012 high in January 2016, and has since formed a rising trend channel similar to that seen in CAD gold.

Since hitting €1,250 in July, euro-gold has come back into the middle of its rising trend channel just below €1,100. We will want to see this long-term (magenta color) lower trendline hold for an interim low, with a higher high to form sequentially by 2018 above €1,250.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold in Australian Dollars (AUD)</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1045" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/d_Gold-in-Australian-Dollars-AUD.png" alt="Gold in Australian Dollars (AUD)" width="1202" height="715" />

Gold as priced in Australian dollars is unique in that the price actually broke down in early 2013 from its long-term rising trendline, shown by the red highlight. Since then, AUD gold has formed a cup consolidation, retesting the 2011 high at $1,800 last summer.

<img class="alignright wp-image-1046" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/e_AUD-gold-Cup-Handle.png" alt="AUD gold Cup Handle" width="437" height="387" />

Notably, AUD gold has failed to regain the broken trendline on five separate occasions since 2013 (red arrows). In technical analysis, broken support often becomes resistance, even in a trending market.

Yet the decline from the recent high down to $1,550 still fits in with the model of a consolidation. In this model, we are looking at a cup and handle continuation pattern, which, as shown in textbook example to the right, is derived from a tea cup setting of the same name.

Should AUD gold make a new all-time high above $1,800, it would be an early-warning signal that gold in other western currencies may be headed in that direction within a few years. (It is quite possible for a long-term trendline to break as it has for AUD gold, but for the market to continue on to new highs, albeit at a lesser rate of acceleration.)

A break below the $1,300 level would indicate the likelihood of a long-term double top at $1,800.

At present, the action between $1,300 and $1,800 must be viewed as consolidative in nature until one of those levels is broken.

		<title><![CDATA[Gold & Silver Approaching Interim Lows]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[2016 has been one of the most volatile years on record for gold: the best first-half performance in 40 years, followed by the ongoing retracement that has seen the bulk of the gains for the metal itself given back.

These moves have left many wondering if this was just a "false rally" in the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">price of gold</a> on the way to a continuation of the 2011-2015 bear market. And while no one can ever say with 100% certainty what the future will bring, with a clear technical view of the markets we are now in the best possible position to capture the moves that lie ahead when they do indeed materialize.

As there are still four trading days left in the year, we will wait until next week to offer a full 2016 year-end review of the precious metals markets and a look ahead for 2017.
<h3>Gold Analysis</h3>
Turning to spot gold itself, the pre-Christmas week featured relatively light trading, with prices finishing at $1,133 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX. Such represents a loss of $3.80 or 0.3% from a week prior.

Notably, this was the seventh weekly loss for gold in a row, the longest such stretch since May 2004. This is an interesting statistic to contemplate. Consider, for instance, that <strong>the last time gold fell for so many weeks in a row was during the early stages of the 2001 - 2011 bull market, </strong>not during a bear market. It is often said that the most severe (percentage per time unit) declines happen during bull markets, as prices must climb a "wall of worry". Will this hold true again? We will know shortly.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1056 size-full" title="Gold-2013-2016" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/a_Gold-2013-2016.png" alt="Gold-2013-2016" width="1205" height="902" />

&nbsp;

Technically, gold is now within sight of the declining broken 2013 - 2015 trend channel we have been monitoring for several weeks, shown in blue above. If the price were to use the broken trendline as support this week, the level to watch for a bounce would be $1,100 precisely. Such a rebound would indicate the potential for a higher-low to form in gold than in 2015. The 2015 bottom zone is labeled by the green band above as between $1,045 - $1,080.

We would place a stronger trust in the low if it were to form as a confluence of the broken blue trendline and the $1,045 - $1,080 support zone. For those two regions to overlap, the bottom would need to wait for the trendline to decline from its current reading at $1,100. Based on the slope of the line, that convergence would happen between February and May of the coming year.

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> is still largely oversold on the daily RSI indicator (red circle, top of chart) below the 30 level, a reading which has corresponded with previous medium-term lows over the past 18 months.

In sum, a short-term bounce should be expected at any moment in gold; however, long-term bottom signals require several converging technical patterns, for which we are still waiting across both the metal and the mining complex.
<h3>Silver Analysis</h3>
<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver spot price</a> fell further than gold again this week, giving up the relative outperformance we had noted during late November and early December versus gold. For the week, silver declined 2.8% or $0.46 cents, to close at $15.76 as of the last trade in New York.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

We would like to call your attention to the <u>short-term steep wedge</u> formation now visible on the silver chart above, shown between the teal and blue trendlines. As periodically mentioned, these wedge formation typically represent reversal or bottoming patterns. In this case, we see steep declining highs since early November, and less steep lows forming since July.

While silver could fall further still within the wedge pattern, <strong>a break of the upper trendline should represent a tradable breakout </strong>for those so inclined to initiate short-term trades<strong>.</strong> On the breakout, an initial target will be $16.25, the broken support from November, with a possibility of an advance toward $17.25, the resistance from early December.

<u>However, a word of caution</u>: breaks from wedges as steep as above cannot be relied upon to represent terminal bottoms in and of themselves. The old investment adage: "The steeper the trend, the less important the break," comes to mind here, and is relevant because the wedge in question is extremely steep (for comparison, a less-steep long-term wedge was observed from 2013 - 2015 in the silver market, and represented a much stronger candidate for a bottom).

Because this wedge is so steep, it may not represent the final low for this retracement in silver. However, it should mark an end to the most severe portion of silver's decline.

Another way to visualize the steepness of silver's recent decline-- and hence likelihood of a rebound in the near future -- is to note that the slope can be observed to be forming a reverse parabolic curve since the summer highs, which is approaching an infinite downward rate by late January. Since such an infinite negative slope is impossible for an asset that cannot go to zero, we know that the current rate of decline will necessarily end in the next few weeks, and such should represent the tradable bounce at minimum. The only question is: does silver make its bounce sooner, or after one final drop over the next two weeks. Both options are highlighted in green, below, on the SLV chart (proxy for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver bullion</a>, used to show intraday price/volume data).

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1058" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/c_SLV-chart-ST-december-2016.png" alt="SLV-chart-ST-december-2016" width="1110" height="830" />

&nbsp;

The key technical point is to watch for the break of the wedge as shown on the main silver chart above to indicate when the worst of the retracement in silver is over.

We will put the full-year relative price performance together for gold, silver, and related markets in our 2016 review, next week.

		<title>2016 Year in Review</title>
		<content><![CDATA[With the arrival of 2017 and another year in the record books, we take a look back at the closing data for 2016 and the major trends that impacted world markets.

For the year, across the major asset classes that we follow, we note the following 2016 ending performances:

&nbsp;

</tbody>
</table>
</div>
In sum, despite the wild volatility, the precious metals put in respectable performances for the full year. These were the first gains for the metals on a yearly basis since 2012, which may indicate the beginning of a trend change.
<h3>"No Confidence" Goes Mainstream</h3>
The most significant theme that we perceived across the political landscape for 2016 was a vote of "no confidence" in the establishment regime. This growing voice of dissent was evident across three major political votes during the year and countless smaller movements worldwide.

First was the vote by British citizens to leave the EU in June. Dubbed "Brexit", the vote came as a surprise to most major polling and media outlets. Central causes of the British dissent are believed to focus on issues of the economy, immigration, and sovereignty. And while a debate of those issues is beyond the scope of this publication, we can clearly observe the net result: the resignation of Prime Minster David Cameron and a major signal of dissatisfaction by UK residents toward the established political regime.

Second came Donald Trump's election in November. Again largely dismissed by the mainstream media and polling organizations even up until the night of the election, the Trump victory came as a surprise to many. Trump will be the first US President to never hold prior political office. A significant message that we take away from the US election is that there are many more voters dissatisfied with the largely superficial "Republican/Democrat" divide than were previously believed to have existed. We did not officially endorse either candidate in the US election; yet clearly there is a growing sense of "no confidence" in the political system here in the United States, and many voters chose to voice that sentiment through a vote for Trump.

Last but not least, the Italian citizens delivered a third anti-establishment vote in rejecting the constitutional amendment proposed by then-Prime Minster Matteo Renzi in December. Largely perceived as supportive of large banks and corporations, Italians rejected the amendment by a final count of over 59%. Renzi resigned the next day.
<h3>The Seeds of a Precious Metals Bull Market Are Being Sown</h3>
Angst in the political system is currently being voiced through the democratic process.

However, it is only a matter of time before that distrust is voiced further through the monetary system. When individuals begin to wake up to the understanding that they are being robbed by the central banks -- <em>regardless of which party is voted in or out of office</em> -- they will then move to vote separately with their pocketbooks. And as <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver spot price</a> remain to this day the only assets completely outside the control of major governments or central banks, they remain the focal point of the growing movement against establishment political planning.

This theme of distrust by citizens toward their established political systems and central banks is a key component of our fundamental investment thesis for precious metals.

As of 2016, still relatively few citizens of the major democratic nations have any knowledge whatsoever regarding precious metals, and even fewer own the monetary assets. In our every day lives, how many people do we know who actually own precious metals in any form? I would urge readers to do some random polling at their workplace, at the coffee shop, at the grocery store, etc. If your experience is anything like mine, you will find that the metals are still barely even known as a legitimate asset class amongst average Americans.

Let us examine the silver market: current estimates show that only 2 billion ounces of silver exist in the investable form above ground.

What if 10% of the combined population of the United States, Great Britain, and Italy each wanted to buy 100 ounces of silver, a modest $1,600 at today's prices?

Our back-of-the-envelope math shows that the combined population of those three countries is 450 million. So if 45 million citizens each wanted to buy 100 ounces of silver, the net result would be a new demand of 4.5 billion ounces.

The silver is not there. The result of such demand coming into such a small market would be that the price would be forced upward by many-fold, as the total dollar amount of metal available for purchase pales in comparison to the dollar supply floating around in individuals' bank accounts.

Even though the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> total market size is much larger than that of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, we have data to show that even gold is widely under-owned to this day. Below we show gold as a percentage of global financial assets (data courtesy CPM).

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1067" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/b_gold-percentgold-global-financial-assets.png" alt="gold-percentgold-global-financial-assets" width="757" height="454" />

&nbsp;

At just under 0.7% of global assets, gold would need to rise four-fold to reach the relative peak set in 1980 when it first hit $850/oz and silver briefly touched $50. As silver remains below its 1980 peak to this day, its advance would likely be greater than gold on a percentage basis.

Momentum is gaining in opposition to the status quo political landscape, and 2016 saw evidence in three major western nations. Those voters are willing to step out and cast a ballot. It is only a matter of time before a critical mass makes the connection between the political world and the financial world and casts a further vote via a movement of assets into the precious metals market.

		<title>US Bond Bubble Cracking</title>
		<content><![CDATA[We have speculated often over the past year that long-dated US bonds were near the end of their unprecedented 36-year bull market. More evidence continues to show up that the trend has begun to shift and that what we have called the "bond bubble" of the last decade is set to begin deflating.

The chart below shows the price of 30-year US bonds from 1980 through the end of 2016. Note that yields, which are currently just under 3.0 %, move opposite to the bond price.

The final phase of the bubble has coincided with a parabolic rise in the price of bonds since 2011 (shown in blue). Parabolic curves typically define the final stages of a bubble or mania, and the price escalates ever upward in an unsustainable fashion after what was an orderly bull market in years past.

Note the breakdown that has just occurred over the last month, with bond prices piercing the parabolic curve decisively lower. We do not anticipate a collapse in bond prices imminently, but rather a new trend of lower prices and higher yields to begin developing over the coming years.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1105" title="US-Bonds-price-1980-2016" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/a_US-Bonds-price-1980-2016.png" alt="US-Bonds-price-1980-2016" width="1150" height="684" />

&nbsp;

It cannot be overstated how important this shift toward lower bond prices and higher interest rates will be for the majority of world citizens, as the United States -- and by consequence many allied governments -- have become addicted to the cheap credit supplied by an ever-willingness of bond investors to loan the US government money at ever-lower interest rates.

Everything from national defense, to our financial system, to our social welfare programs, to our real estate markets, have been given their capacities and valuations by the availability of cheap credit via the bond market. All investors who have been active in any market for 36 years or less know only falling interest rates as their financial backdrop.

This paradigm is soon to be flipped upside down, and after a generation of falling rates, it is not inconceivable that a generation of rising interest rates is set to come.
<h3>Gold Versus Bonds</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1106 size-full" title="Gold-Bonds-1980-2016" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/b_Gold-Bonds-1980-2016.png" alt="Gold-Bonds-1980-2016" width="952" height="635" />

&nbsp;

We should note that for much of 2016, and especially during the second half, both gold and US bonds have been moving in tandem, rising during Brexit and falling after the Trump victory.

Notwithstanding the slight outperformance by gold, both were considered "safety assets" and investors generally bought and sold both assets together.

This may lead some investors to fear that gold will continue to decline with bonds, if the bond bubble has burst.

Over the long run, we must state that gold and bonds are intrinsically located on opposite ends of the safety spectrum. While <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> has represented money and retained its value for over 5,000 years of history, bonds are essentially paper contracts which are, in many respects, an inferior asset than even US dollars during an inflationary episode.

Whereas US dollars can at least be used now and converted into tangible assets, bonds represent a set number of US dollars to be paid <em>in the future</em>.

Through studying historic inflationary periods, from the 1920’s in Weimar Germany to the 1970’s in the United States, we learn that such episodes, the single worst asset to hold is a bond. Meanwhile, precious metals tend to be the best performers. So while gold and bonds are currently being viewed by the market as both generic "safety assets", this correlation will not continue indefinitely.

Below we can see that the above relationship, when viewed over a proper timeframe, yields a different perspective: since the bond bull market began in 1980, gold moved opposite it for the first 20 years, only to play catch up from 2000 onward, followed by the brief period of high correlation seen recently:

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1108" title="gold-bonds-2000-2016" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/c_gold-bonds-2000-2016.png" alt="gold-bonds-2000-2016" width="1150" height="767" />
<h3>Gold’s Long-Term Outlook</h3>
Backing out our typical short-term perspective of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> for the longer-term view: we continue to believe that the zone shown in green, between $850 - $1,045 as defined by the confluence of the four important technical levels labeled on the chart, represented the highest likelihood for a long-term bottom after the 2011 – 2015 decline.

Should gold retrace further into the green zone during 2017, we expect it will form a nominal new low in price, perhaps down to $1,000 or $925, as a final bear market bottom. It is quite possible that this low has already been established as of late 2015, with the current retracement representing a higher-low or double-bottom pattern now in formation.

The process that we are navigating in typical weeks through the shorter-term charts represents the complexity with which these longer-term multi-year bottoms form.

		<title><![CDATA[2016 - 2020 Silver & Gold Queen's Beasts Release Updates]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the internationally known and praised coins in the bullion market have decades of history in their mintage, but this Queen’s Beasts series is a new and exclusive release from the </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/government-mints/royal-mint"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Royal Mint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Queen’s Beasts series, inspired by hundreds of years of royal heraldry, includes ten coin designs, based on animals and mythical creatures. For over 500 years British monarchs have used beasts to symbolize their royal ancestry and family allegiances. The original Queen’s Beasts were a set of ten heraldic statues produced by the Ministry of Works for the coronation ceremony of Queen Elizabeth II on 2 June 1953. The Beasts stood at six feet in height and were composed of plaster and sculpted by renowned sculptor James Woodford.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1135 size-full" title="2016-2020-Silver-Gold-Queen-Beasts-Release-Updates" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Queens-Beasts-updates.jpg" alt="2016-2020-Silver-Gold-Queen-Beasts-Release-Updates" width="805" height="450" />
<b><i>Here are the released and upcoming design concepts which will form the entire series:</i></b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1st– The Lion of England – February 2016</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2nd-The Griffin of Edward III – October 2016</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3rd– The Red Dragon of Wales – March 2017</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4th– The Unicorn of Scotland – September 2017</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5th -The Black Bull of Clarence – March 2018</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6th- The Falcon of the Plantagenets – September 2018</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7th- The Yale of Beaufort – March 2019</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8th– The White Lion of Mortimer – September 2019</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">9th– The White Horse of Hanover – March 2020</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10th-The White Greyhound of Richmond – September 2020</span></li>
</ul>
<strong><i>Meanwhile, the Royal Mint hasn’t announced the final coins’ designs for 2018-2020 yet and no photos of coins are on hand now.</i></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">History tells us that at the coronation of Her Majesty The Queen, ten heraldic beasts stood guard. These creatures symbolized the various strands of royal ancestry brought together in the young woman about to be crowned queen. Each proud beast, used as a heraldic badge by the generations that went before her, was inspired by the King’s Beasts of Henry VIII that still line the bridge over the moat at his Hampton Court Palace. The original plaster statues now sit in the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau after the Canadian Government took possession of them in July 1959. James Woodford also sculpted a series of replicas out of Portland Stone, which stands proudly in the Kew Gardens of London.</span>

<b><i>History of the previous launches:</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The first released coin</strong> in this series was the </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2016-great-britain-1-oz-gold-queen-s-beast-coin-bu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lion of England,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> probably one of the most familiar beasts in the series. While many of the other beasts are fantastical or mythical creatures, the Lion is a real animal that is easy for people to imagine. The Lion has represented England for centuries and since the twelfth-century Lions have appeared on the coat of arms of every British monarch. It also appears in the Royal Arms, alongside the Scottish Unicorn, supporting the quartered shield, and is featured on many other important items, from coins to British passports.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The second release</strong> was </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-great-britain-1-oz-gold-queen-beast-griffin-bu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffin of Edward III</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an ancient mythical beast. It was considered a beneficent creature, signifying courage and strength combined with guardianship, vigilance, swiftness and keen vision.

		<title>Volatility Expected as Gold Tests $1,200</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold was up nearly $23 last week to finish at $1,196 as of the final trade in New York on Friday. Such was the third weekly gain in a row for the historically-monetary metal.</span>A technical update on the price of gold is in order after our analysis of December 26 came within a few days of identifying the most recent low at $1,120.  Gold is at a technical juncture, the resolution of which is going to play a large role in defining the trend and level of volatility to be expected for 2017.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1151 size-full" title="gold price volatility 2017" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3.png" width="1210" height="905" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The price level between $1,190 and $1,200 is the most important that we are presently watching (black double line, labeled Initial Resistance). This price zone acted as support for gold once in February, once in March, and once again in late May. When a price level acts as support on multiple occasions, it increases the legitimacy of the buying pressure seen there. In essence, we saw the same group of value-buyers step in each time the price approached $1,200 last spring.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, something changed last November as the price retreated in the wake of the reversal, following <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/11/14/trump-victory-markets-reverse-course/">Trump’s victory</a>. The gold price fell through $1,200 with only so much as a two-day bounce. For whatever reason, those buyers who were present through most of 2016 at this level failed to show up in November.</span>
<h3><b>Gold Approaches $1,200 Again</b></h3>
After bouncing at $1,120, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is now approaching the $1,200 region again, this time from the lower side. In technical analysis, a major principle that becomes relevant is that support typically turns into resistance. What this means is that – all things being equal – we would expect that the $1,200 zone, which saw a lack of large buyers suddenly in November, should again see limited buying activity when the price is approached again.

Thus, our general expectation at this juncture is for gold to back off in the current price region, and to begin to retreat back to December 2016’s lows. A likely scenario we will be watching for is a double bottom, or perhaps a higher low to form here in 2017, when compared to 2015 and 2016’s lows of $1,045 and $1,120, respectively.

However, if gold were to surprise us and continue to advance through $1,200 immediately, it would be an important indicator for 2017. It would show us that a new set of buyers had entered the market who were not present during last November’s decline.

Such would have important ramifications for the rest of the year. First, we would set our sights on the next target at $1,251, which was the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire 2016 advance, and beyond that the $1,300 region, which represents the long-term 2011-2016 downtrend that still holds.However, even more importantly, if we see a surge above $1,200 at this juncture, it would represent the beginning of increased volatility for the gold market for the remainder of the year. In essence, we will be seeing a new group of buyers enter the market – and we do not have enough price data to gauge their buying patterns yet. They could be physical buyers who missed out on the 2016 rally, they could be central banks anticipating the need to support currencies, they could be a new class of traders. We cannot be certain on their identities, but we can be certain that they were not present in significant quantities last November -- so their presence must be considered a source of expected volatility over the remainder of 2017.
<h3><b>Gold Volatility Expected</b></h3>
A<img class="alignright wp-image-1152 size-medium" title="where to find the biggest market moves 2017" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2-300x121.png" width="300" height="121" />s an interesting corollary, below is a cutout from last week’s Bloomberg article, with the title shown at right. The article highlights that the options market, which allows investors to make highly-leveraged bets in either direction for an underlying asset, is pricing in the highest volatility of any sector in the world specifically for the precious metals equities in 2017. Shown by the red shaded area below, the options market is pricing in a 34% volatility premium for the large and mid-cap gold producers (GDX) and a 44% volatility premium for the junior miners (GDXJ).

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The implied volatility premium is the portion of the contract value that options writers build into the option price to cover their perceived volatility risk. The higher the implied volatility, the higher the premium that options writers demand to sell the contracts.</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1150 size-full" title="gold stocks options most volatile 2017" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/1.png" width="825" height="333" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While most readers will be primarily concerned with prices for the physical bullion market, there is a price relationship between the companies that mine for gold and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">the price of gold</a> itself. After all, we are talking about two different sides of the same sector.</span>

So if options writers are anticipating the highest volatility of any sector in the world for the precious metals equities, we can be certain they are also expecting volatility in the value of their products, the underlying metals.
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we monitor the price action around $1,200 for gold over the coming week, let us remember that advances and retracements are expected to be increasingly volatile over the coming year, as new classes of investors enter the market. However, with volatility comes opportunity. </span>

Those looking to avoid the expected gyrations this year would do well to consider a strategy of dollar-cost averaging into their positions over a number of months, while those on a more active trading program will benefit by keeping in mind the technical levels mentioned herein.

		<title>President Trump and the Federal Reserve</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

The Trump era is officially upon us. While we are politically-independent here and not officially supportive of either major American party, we believe Trump’s election and inauguration last Friday is part of a larger worldwide trend in the emergence of “no confidence” votes against the mainstream political establishments. Manifesting here in the United States, Trump’s tenure should be a particularly unique period of history to be an observer of, with reverberations to be felt around the world.

Case in point: Trump is the first President in modern history to openly criticize the Federal Reserve for its money-printing practices. Saying Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen should be “ashamed” of keeping interest rates too low (which requires printing money to buy short-dated bonds), accusing the Fed of creating a “false economy” and engaging in “political things” – this is unprecedented rhetoric coming from a presidential candidate during a major campaign.

The Chinese proverb says: <em>“May you live in interesting times.”</em> Indeed.
<h3>The Fed and the White House</h3>
The last president to openly criticize the Fed is believed to have been George H. W. Bush, who spoke about the central bank <em>after</em> his 1992 defeat. Ironically, Bush blamed the Fed for <strong><em>not printing enough</em></strong> money, saying: <em>“I think that if the interest rates had been lowered more dramatically that I would have been re-elected President, because the [economic] recovery that we were in would have been more visible.”</em>

Fast forward to last September, in which the relationship between the White House and the Fed over the preceding generation was perfectly illustrated by Hillary Clinton when she said: <em>“You should not be commenting on Fed actions when you are either running for president or you are president.”</em>

So now we have Trump who indeed seems comfortable commenting on Fed actions while running for president. Will he consider criticizing the central bank while actually in office?

Consider that Rebekah Mercer, daughter of billionaire hedge-fund CEO Robert Mercer, sat on the executive committee of Trump’s transition team. She is expected to play a key role in fostering Trump’s agenda during his presidency. Her father, Robert Mercer, in addition to being head of the famed Renaissance Technologies fund, was the chief backer of the Jackson Hole Summit in August 2015, a private financial symposium designed to stand in contrast to the Fed’s own conference held at the same time and place.

The principle themes of the Mercer-funded summit? <strong>The abolishment of the Federal Reserve and a return to the gold standard</strong>.

With the advisory and financial backing of billionaires with anti-Fed leanings, will Trump be the first president in modern history to question the seemingly omniscient central bank during his term?

And how would most Americans – who are still largely unaware that the US dollar is not backed by any tangible asset – respond to a president questioning the institution that issues our fiat currency?

Any significant move of assets into <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> by a substantial portion of the United States (or world) citizens would cause a price acceleration unlike anything witnessed thus far in our analysis.

This is why, even as we endeavor to profit from the shorter-term swings in price that occur, we always advocate that investors hold a <em>certain</em> portion of their assets in a core metals position, stored as far outside the banking system as reasonably possible.

And so as Trump begins his first full week in office, the first active president to openly criticize the central bank in modern history, we once again try to filter out the charged rhetoric that appears in the mainstream financial and political press and turn as always to the charts.
<h3>US Dollar Update</h3>
In a confounding example of either early-presidential double-talk, or perhaps a reference to the singular currency-devaluation policies of China, Mr. Trump – who spoke so harshly of Federal Reserve money-printing on the campaign trail – stated on Tuesday that the US dollar was “too strong”.

The result on Tuesday was to send the dollar back to 100.2 on the Dollar Index, down over 1% for the day against a basket of foreign currencies.

It is here that words from politicians can become misleading and we must focus on regular identification of key zones on the charts:

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1162" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/a_USD-Dollar-Index-jan-2017.png" alt="USD-Dollar-Index-jan-2017" width="1014" height="881" />


While the dollar has been weak over the last month, roughly corresponding to <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold’s price</a> rise from the December lows, this price action must still be viewed within the context of the breakout from the 2-year consolidation shown above between 92 and 100 on the index.

What we see thus far is simply a higher retest of the breakout zone.

We must respect the dollar breakout until proven otherwise, as it will tend to exert a negative drag on the precious metals in a typical trading environment.

We would consider the move in the dollar to have failed and thus to constitute an ominous long-term “false breakout” should the index close below 99.5, the spike low seen on December 8. Such a failed advance can typically lead to a strong reversal in the opposite direction.

Of course, the dollar and precious metals do not always move in opposite directions, and are sometimes highly correlated, a topic we will examine in more depth in the near future.

Happy investing this week, as we enter what should be a fascinating time to be a market observer if the new president does openly decide to criticize the Fed at any point during the next four years.

		<title>Gold Technical Update – Short Term Gyrations Amidst Long-Term Bottom</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold was resilient over the last two weeks in holding up over the $1,200 level, and indeed almost had us fooled that it was about to ignore this resistance and continue to advance higher.  Yet after several failures to mount a sustained advance, gold succumbed to selling pressure by Tuesday. For the week, gold closed down $16 or 1.4% to finish at $1,188 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday.   </span>

Although <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> did push above the $1,200 figure marginally, the message of the market here is of sellers who showed up every time gold attempted to make some distance above the round number. We can thus update our primary gold chart below, with Initial Resistance labeled as $1,200 - $1,215.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1174" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-1.png" alt="Primary Gold Chart " width="1199" height="898" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our short-term expectations for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> continue to call for lower prices. At the same time, we can tentatively draw a new trendline between the December 2015 low and the higher December 2016 low, as shown above in blue (dashed).</span>

It would be extremely healthy action to see the new trendline tested and held for a second time at a nominally higher level, such as $1,130 - $1,135. This is where gold would meet the trend if it were to test it this week.
<h3><b>Gold’s Long-Term Basing Perspective</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Backing out the timeframe, periodically it is beneficial to strip away previous annotations and start with a blank chart, to gauge the big-picture trend of the market.  Below is gold from 2011 to present, with minimal annotations near the current price – instead of with a focus toward the major pattern developing over the last five years:</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1175 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-2.png" alt="Gold Long-term Perspective" width="1203" height="900" />

Despite the weakness is seen since July, what is emerging here in gold is a five-year “cup” base pattern. This basing pattern features multiple swings of $300 higher and lower in both directions – but as a sum, we are observing a clear rounded bottoming pattern, with a reduced rate of decline from 2013 – 2015 now giving way to the beginning of an advancing market.

Strong evidence for the shift in trend can be seen from the fact that the 2016 high of $1,378 clearly exceeded both the 2015 high of $1,305 and the mid-2014 high of $1,345. A bear market is defined by lower peaks – and when a new peak, such as that seen in 2016, exceeds a prior one – it is telling us that the market is in the process of changing behavior.
<h3><b>Anticipating Short-Term Potentials</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, these changes take the time to play out and are filled with wild short-term gyrations. The question that we still cannot definitively answer is: was the recent December 2016 $1,124 low the bottom for the entirety of the correction off 2016’s peak?</span>

The above base scenario assumes that it was – and if so, after a somewhat higher low due to form within the next few weeks, gold should continue two-steps forward, one step backward advances through the remainder of the year to re-challenge the 2016 high at $1,378.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, let us imagine that the recent low does not hold and that gold continues to grind down further for several months – retesting the 2015 bottom in the vicinity of $1,045. The two hypotheticals are presented below through the green target callouts:</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1176" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-3.png" alt="Gold Short-Term Potentials" width="1200" height="913" />

&nbsp;

<b>Neither of the above two scenarios would change the validity of the basing action we are observing in the long-term cup formation above.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If a double bottom or a grind below $1,100 in gold must occur, it will only expand out the timeline of the basing formation, not change the overall pattern. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of the higher high in 2016 amidst a lessening rate of decline over the three years prior should not be underestimated (large red circle, above). This market is in the process of changing its trend after the 2011 – 2015 decline… it is only the precise gyrations that remain to be seen and navigated.</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review- January, 31</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">With all the late events in US policy and on the international platform, a lot of people are scared of market changes and worried that the entire move of gold prices this year could be a fake manipulation or that some giant drop is going to happen.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every investor less or more experienced knows that the financial markets move in cycles and you cannot avoid the fact that the market manipulation exists. Therefore, we should also consider other reasons for investing in precious metals instead of sharp actions based only on the possible collapse of Media information. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you once decided to be part of this “investing team”, you will automatically keep the questions “Should we expect the gold prices to rise”, “Should we expect another drop”? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So many options can be used to speculate on falling stock prices, and to hedge against falling prices to protect long-only portfolios. Panic is mostly needles and you cannot follow and predict all of them. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bullion Exchanges has decided to report impartial precious metals market updates for helping our customers to stay up-to-date with the mainstream market news. In the current market situation, it’s wise to look for the alternative ways to secure your wealth.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All our articles published here are to inform your thinking, not lead it. Only you can decide the best place for your investment, and also any decision can put money at risk.  </span>

&nbsp;

<b><i>Gold is up 1.4% at $1,212 per ounce today highest from January 24, silver rises to the strongest point since December 8, Dow Jones index drops down triple digits (-148.47/-0,74% Today’s Change), and investors are waiting for  US Fed meeting today!</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
With negative cues from all corners, we may see Trump’s policy looks not market-friendly at all, and investors are frantically looking for safe havens for their wealth. After all the predictions and market analysis, it seems like our worst predictions finally becoming truth.Meanwhile, a series of comments from the Trump administration about the foreign exchange market could crush all good expectations. Donald Trump Trade Chief Peter Navarro alleged Germany is abusing euro for own gain. Later President Trump said other countries take advantage of the US by devaluing their currencies. Earlier Mr. Navarro accused “cheating  China” of destroying US factories and flooding the US with “defective and cancerous” exports.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After Trump’s immigration ban temporarily restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, investors across the country got a “risk-off” reaction through the global financial markets. Technology companies also sagged on worries that future administration moves will make it harder for them to hire skilled, foreign-born workers, global stocks announced the biggest lost in six weeks after Trump signed this executive order and fired the government lawyer Sally Yates, who refused to support his decision. </span>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> keep staying under increasing inflationary pressure. With all the sort of protests happening now across the country, the US market looks highly unstable on the international platform.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today the investors and traders are waiting for the closed meeting of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at 1:00 PM on Tuesday, January 31, 2017.

		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold </a>drops down at $ 1,205.90 </i></b><b><i>(-5.30)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price -$ 17.52 </i></b><b><i>(-0.09</i></b><b><i>), Dow Jones index drops up 19,959.19 </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.48%)</i></b><b><i>, Fed Report highlights and FOMC scheduled meeting today!</i></b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors among the globe are looking forward to the preview results of the first FED meeting on Tuesday since President Trump took office. Also, FOMC will publish its first annual report today.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/01/23/trump-federal-reserve-dollar-index/">Trump’s announcement</a> that he would likely replace the Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen when her term of office expires in February 2018, a lot of investors are expecting the relationship between the Executive branch and the Fed is going to be very intense in following months.</span>
<h3><b>US Dollar updates:</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Gold went back on Wednesday, the dollar firmed ahead and recovered a little ground after recording its worst start to the year in three decades on concerns the United States was poised to ditch its two-decade-old "strong dollar" policy. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/11/21/dollar-surges-bonds-fall-trump-aftermath/">dollar index</a> traded less than 0.3 percent above the previous day's seven-week low on Wednesday, while the euro traded down 0.3 percent on the day just below $1.08.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not good news for the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold </a>market, as the dollar hike may strengthen the confidence in the U.S. economy and its currency, which is gold's biggest rival.</span>
<h3><b>New Fed and FOMC economic forecast:</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fed and FOMC hold about eight regularly scheduled meetings during the year and other if required. FOMC annual report, providing the information about financial statements, statistical tables and maps will be published on February, 1.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To summarize the Federal Reserve meeting, we can say most analytics are in wait-and-see mode on the Trump economy. They're clearly paying attention to the debate over fiscal policy but aren't ready to move forecasts yet until they have a clearer idea what the president will do. The perspective that Fed's plan to raise rates three times, instead of two times, next year is highly possible. The election was the main difference for a market in 2016 and we like it or not Trump’s victory changed the market pulse. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The final economic projections the Fed will release only in March. For now, there are some good reasons to expect that Fed’s position after Trump’s decisions addressed to them will soften in 2017, which would be positive for the gold price. The experts say the technical situation in the gold market is different now. In 2015, gold turned out to be oversold, while in 2016 only 30 % was sold in the first half of the year, and even gold dropped down in November 2016, it was still not oversold before the Fed's move in December.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These expectations might be built on just predictions, but it does not change a situation where the current sentiment towards gold is negative, we hope it may change later in 2017.</span>

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold</a> goes up at $ 1,222.30 </i></b><b><i>(+14.30)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price $ 17.73 </i></b><b><i>(+0.20</i></b><b><i>), Dow Jones index goes up to 19,831.09 </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.30%)</i></b><b><i>, Global Stock Market overview and US companies report earnings!</i></b>
<h3><b>Global Stock Market overview</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stock market opened lower on Thursday as uncertainty related to the new administration’s diplomacy. President Donald Trump had harsh comments with Australia and Mexico, both of which are important allies and trading US partners, and he also put Iran "on notice" over potential new sanctions after the country performed a ballistic missile test.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many individual stock markets are already in a bear market, including Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, and Japan.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these events beg the question: Will the U.S. fall into the bear market too?</span>
<h3><b>U.S. dollar updates</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar keeps remaining lower level against other major currencies on Thursday, despite the report earnings of U.S. companies, jobless claims data, as markets were still digesting the Bank of England’s earlier policy decision, as well as the Federal Reserve’s statement released on Wednesday.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. companies report earnings</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">What should every investor know about company's earning reports? There is always a probability that stock market and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> price could fall after the companies announce their earnings reports quarterly and annually. But in fact, expectations always play a key role in stock’s price changes than actual announcements of earning reports. </span>The investors with a long-term view are not likely to make changes to their holdings based on a single earnings announcement.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We encourage our clients to stay current on macro events and geopolitical challenges. However, don’t  make any sharp decisions because of micromanagement messaging from the media.</span>]]></content>

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold</a> goes up at $ 1,220.20 </i></b><b><i>(+0.40)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price $ 17.56 </i></b><b><i>(+0.05)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index goes up to 20,051.32 </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.84%)</i></b><b><i>, Employment Situation report! </i></b>

The gold price hits 12-week highs.

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. dollar updates</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar keeps climbing in the aftermath of the Federal Reserve's decision to raise rates for the second time this decade. The US dollar index</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is up by 0.8% at 103.01 as of 7:21 a.m. ET — an almost 14-year high.  </span>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Jobs report</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's the first jobs report to be released under the Trump administration. The jobs report has also become a contentious issue because President Trump once dubbed the unemployment rate a "hoax." Meanwhile, the Trump administration talks a lot about bringing in lots of news jobs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">US markets are on the rise after the better than expected headline jobs figure, with financial companies also benefitting from the prospect of looser regulation.</span>

		<title><![CDATA[Gold & Silver vs Commodities]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Thompson Reuters/Jeffries Commodity Research Bureau Index (CRB Index) is a weighted index of 19 commodities that trade on exchanges worldwide, composed of energy products, precious and industrial metals, and agricultural commodities. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We typically perform a relative strength analysis of gold or silver versus the CRB commodity index below our primary precious metals charts. This gives a quick reference to see if <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold </a>and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> are mostly being impacted by their inclusion with other world commodities (as funds and institutions will often buy “a basket of commodities” for investment purposes all at once), or if there is something unique happening to the precious metals irrespective of other commodities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the weightings and components of the index have changed since it was first published in 1947, the CRB is still largely the best measure we have for broad price trends amongst major world commodities. The 19 specific contracts now included: aluminum, cocoa, coffee, copper, corn, cotton, crude oil, gold, heating oil, lean hogs, live cattle, natural gas, nickel, orange juice, silver, soybeans, sugar, unleaded gas, and wheat.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is a chart of the CRB Commodity Index from 1980 through the present, with relative strength comparisons between gold versus the CRB and silver versus the CRB below it:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1233 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/CRB-02.06.17-1024x924.png" alt="Chart of the CRB Commodity Index" width="840" height="758" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important point to note on this chart is that </span><b>worldwide commodity prices are currently at lows not seen in over 40 years. </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Commodity prices are lower than they were during the dot-com bubble, lower than the recession of 2001, and – astonishingly – lower than during the worldwide financial crisis of 2008-2009.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To imagine that the global demand versus supply equilibrium for industrial &amp; agricultural commodities is poorer than it was during the greatest financial crisis of our lifetimes is difficult to fathom – but it is exactly what the charts are telling us.</span>
<h3><b>Precious Metals Relative Strength</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below the main chart are ratios showing gold versus the CRB and silver versus the CRB. These ratios show the relative strength between the precious metals and the 19-commodity CRB Index.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we can see that gold has outperformed the basket of commodities 300% since 2006, while silver has outperformed 350%. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another data point we can reference is that while the CRB is now below its 2008 financial crisis lows, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> is still well above its 2008 crash low ($680 per ounce), as is silver ($8.50 per ounce), respectively.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus… something happening to the precious metals that are not happening within other commodity markets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is strong evidence that not all commodities are being treated the same within the investment world.</span>
<h3><b>What is Relative Strength Telling Us?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This outperformance since 2006 is in stark contrast to the near tandem price action that bound precious metals to the rest of the commodity complex between 1982 and 2006. This performance is visible from the nearly flat-line on the relative strength charts during that timeframe (red highlights).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We speculate that starting around 2006, amidst increased monetary debasement by central banks and unsustainable debt loads by a world government, a certain portion of investors began to favor the precious metals for their historic monetary roles. This is a demand that is above and beyond the usage the metals have in industrial fabrication, which is what was appearing across the rest of the commodity complex. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We anticipate that the divergence between precious metals and other commodities which started in 2006 will be seen as the initial stages of what will become a larger worldwide phenomenon over the coming decade.</span>
<h3><b>Applying Relative Strength</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that relative strength indicators are best observed as markets are declining – because we can see evidence of underlying accumulation happening behind the scenes. What we see is that physical buyers have been accumulating precious metals even as their prices were falling alongside other commodities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rising relative strength is important to observe during declines because it shows us which sectors should lead when the overall commodity complex finally bottoms. For example, it is likely that oil bottomed in early 2016 at $26 per barrel and natural gas bottomed similarly at $1.60 per million British Thermal Units (mmBTU). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While there will be opportunities across the entire commodity complex over the next several years, relative strength indicators are telling us that precious metals are poised to lead the advance higher as stabilization occurs across the entire commodity spectrum.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold</a> goes up at $ 1,230.60 </i></b><b><i>(+10.00)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price $ 17.75 </i></b><b><i>(+0.19)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index drops down to 20,037.30 </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.17%)</i></b><b><i>, Stock Market today!</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. dollar updates</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. dollar rose on Monday, trending higher throughout the session as investors bet that Europe could see continued dovish monetary policy going forward, although geopolitical uncertainty remains elevated.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dollar index was getting stronger at 99.96 from 99.88 last week. </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are no top-tier economic events scheduled for Monday. In general Wall Street stocks traded modestly lower on Monday as the main indexes pulled back amid mixed earnings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.15%  fell 29 points, or 0.2%, to 20.041 as gains in Apple Inc. Over the past two weeks, investors have shown to be jittery after controversial policy announcements, such as travel ban applying to people from seven predominantly Muslim countries.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the market still appears to be uneasy about the recent executive orders on immigration and travel bans from seven nations in the Middle East and Northern Africa. Many of the world’s largest technology firms, including Alphabet (GOOG) and Amazon.com (AMZN), have condemned the executive orders, which were temporarily overturned by a Federal Court this week. This situation remains very fluid and may impact trading in the days to come, especially with the light schedule for the business beat this week.</span>]]></content>

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold</a> goes up at $ 1,232.50 </i></b><b><i>(+0.60)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price $ 17.80 </i></b><b><i>(+0.02)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index rises to 20,132.93  </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.40%)</i></b><b><i>, Stock market today!</i></b>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar updates</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar operated a bit better on Monday than the previous week, but it’s still fluttered above a more than 2-month low. At this point, it plays good assistance to precious metals’ spot value, that keeps rising. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts prognosticate there is nothing out there that think the Dollar is going to move upward in any sort of hurry.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold has been making a steady recovery from its Christmas low of $1,128.90. Also, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> has been increased in price not only in US dollar but other major currency ( Euros, Pounds Sterling, Japanese Yen), that performs the gold demand is higher and it has actually increased in value on a global arena. </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding slowly Monday across the global market and lack of top-tier economic events scheduled for this week, most investors are still discussing last week events. The <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/02/02/daily-market-review-february-2/">news</a> occupied traders' attention last week, as economic releases, jobs annual report and companies earnings reports slowed down experts forecast.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq hit new records high on Tuesday, recovering from losses in the previous session. In general, we can say that market is getting recovered after the release of very positive economic data, most notably - the report that the nation had added 227,000 jobs in January. More than half of all companies have reported results for the latest quarter and, in general, the outcomes have been favorable and have helped the stock market stay near record levels.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - February, 8</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold</a> goes up at $ 1,242.10 </i></b><b><i>(+6.00)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price $ 17.90 </i></b><b><i>(+0.06)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index drops down to 20,025.01  </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.32%)</i></b><b><i>, Stock market today!</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar updates</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar keeps benefiting from arising political uncertainty ahead of a number of crucial new Administration’s decisions. The dollar gains accelerated after China reported its foreign exchange reserves unexpectedly fell below the $3 trillion level in January for the first time in nearly six years. Until we have answers to some of the big (policy) questions the experts are fearful of what the administration is prepared to keep a lid on the dollar. This week President Trump has a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. A lot of investors worry, that with Trump pro-Japanese approach and anti-China stance this meeting could bring more issues to US dollar and other currencies.</span>

This is obvious, that a strong dollar means we have greater buying power. In other words, US currency is worthy outside of the country, based on the same logic, imports also become cheaper, can be good for any economy.

Meanwhile, the experts point out that these geopolitical happenings alone and rising dollar don’t provide safe demand for precious metals afloat and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> price particularly.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week is pretty quiet for market updates. The main changes: The S&amp;P energy sector led decliners, capping gains in the overall stock market, the oil prices have fallen, the Dow and Nasdaq hit record highs. There is no major economic data due Wednesday, shifting investors' focus, the market is waiting for the next big catalyst. </span>

		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold</a> drops down at $ 1,226.80 </i></b><b><i>(-10.30)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price $ 17.78 </i></b><b><i>(-0.05)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index goes up to 20,224.49  </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.36%)</i></b><b><i>, Stock market today!</i></b>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>US Dollar</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After President Donald Trump once called National Security Adviser Mike Flynn to ask about the impact of strong US dollar and came up with the idea that strong dollar can be bad for US economy because American companies can’t compete with Chinese companies due to the strong US currency. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">New Administration suggests that strong dollar can hurt US based producers that export their goods, which become more expensive. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Governor of Central Bank of Iran announced that US Dollar will no longer be used within the country as a response to US President Donald Trump’s controversial temporary travel ban on certain countries including Iran.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, experts concern we can expect US Dollar might keep going down.  US Dollar forecasting is full of breakdowns, like any asset the dollar can go up, down or sideways. We suggest the best way is following the stock updates, because it may be some time yet before the central tendency reasserts itself, however.       </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">        </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors’ enthusiasm for President promises of tax cuts, deregulation, and fiscal stimulus leads the market in a  “fragile spot” this week. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street's three main indexes surged to fresh record highs on Thursday after President Donald Trump said he would make a major tax announcement in a few weeks. After the market drifted sideways for a couple weeks, now here it is at levels on the S&amp;P  (Standard &amp; Poor) where it has broken through overhead resistance," said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates. It means the US market could continue to grind higher from this point. </span>]]></content>

		<title>The US Dollar Is Looking Fragile – Silver to Be Major Beneficiary</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens with the US dollar over the next two months is going to be extremely important not only for the precious metals themselves, but for most world commodities and currencies. The world’s reserve currency is at a critical juncture, and we still see few mainstreamg analysts discussing the ramifications for what appears to be a reversal lower in the works for the dollar -- either imminently, or at the latest by end-2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For reference, the dollar had been consolidating for nearly two years between 92 and 100 on the US Dollar Index, shown below. In November, that consolidation broke out to the upside, which corresponded with the weakness seen in precious metals late in the year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This past week we have seen a bounce in the dollar at the lowest possible technical level for us to consider the November 2016 breakout in the Dollar Index to still be valid. Specifically, after falling for the last five weeks, the dollar rebounded at 99.5 and closed the week higher by 0.9%, to finish at 100.8 on the Index. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The medium-term perspective is updated below:</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1272" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Image-1-Feb-13-1024x609.png" alt="The medium-term perspective is updated below:" width="840" height="500" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the dollar held at the lowest threshold where we could still consider its breakout to remain valid (99.5) the US currency is looking increasingly fragile from a technical standpoint. </span>

<b>The weakness of the breakout is not indicative of a market prepared to move higher over the long run.   </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As an important data point: the most recent low of 99.5 (second retest of the breakout) matched exactly the level of the first retest from November 2016.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We thus do not have a higher low in the US Dollar Index following the initial breakout. New bull markets, especially in their early stages, should be characterized by higher highs and higher lows for medium-term pivots.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout from a two-year consolidation </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feature an impulsive move higher, and subsequent retests (lows) should come at sequentially higher levels.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, at this time we can observe that the most recent low in the dollar was not higher than the December low. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is negative technical divergence – and it leads us to suspect a reversal lower of a multi-year magnitude is in the early formation stages. The only question is: does sustained dollar weakness materialize within the next two months, or will a grinding advance continue for the remainder of this year first? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not have enough data yet to answer that question; however, those with an eye for long-term secular trends in the commodity and currency markets should be paying attention to this action in the US dollar very closely.</span>
<h3><b>Silver to Be a Major Beneficiary<img class="alignright wp-image-1273 size-medium" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Image-2-Feb-13-300x201.png" alt="Silver over Gold " width="300" height="201" /></b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is to be a falling US dollar backdrop either soon or within the next year, we would expect inflation to begin to pick up in the United States. Generally speaking, a falling US dollar will cause prices of commodities and international trade items to be more expensive as priced in the falling currency.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metals should “sniff” this inflation out ahead of time, like a well-trained hound. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, in an inflationary environment, silver should outperform gold on a relative basis, as the former has greater industrial usage in electronics and solar fabrication -– industries which would be supported by overall rising prices.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is exactly what we observe since the recent December 2016 lows, as <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> has outperformed <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> by over 5.3% in less than two months.</span>
<h3><b>Silver Recent Technical Analysis</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the week as a whole, silver finished higher by $0.45 cents or 2.6% to close at $17.93 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on
Friday.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The advance in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver spot price</a> this week resulted in a break of the best-fit trendline of the primary declining channel that we have been observing since early July (royal blue trend channel). This is a positive sign for the entire precious metals complex and continues to strengthen the legitimacy of the breakout we saw above the $17.25 (black horizontal line) resistance two weeks prior.</span>

<img class="alignright size-large wp-image-1274" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Image-3-Feb-13-1024x767.png" alt="Silver Recent Technical Analysis" width="840" height="629" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver looks healthy at this juncture, and despite the continued rising from the December lows, we observe that the RSI indicator (top of chart) it not yet at an overbought reading, as it was during intermediate peaks in 2016. Silver appears to have more room to run on this advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We should expect some grinding price action with short 2-3 day corrections over the next two weeks as traders ascertain the legitimacy of the breakout.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver should be supported at $17.00 - $17.25 on any weakness. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our near-term target for silver is $18.75, after which we will evaluate the possibility of an intermediate correction.</span>

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold</a> drops down at $ 1,226.90 </i></b><b><i>(-9.40)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price $ 17.98 </i></b><b><i>(-0.04)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index goes up to 20,338.60  </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.34%)</i></b><b><i>, Stock market today!</i></b>
<h3><b>US Dollar</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we already mentioned in our weekly analysis US dollar changes over the next two months are going to be extremely important for the precious metals themselves, and also for most world commodities and currencies. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. dollar gained against most major rivals on Monday after the weekend meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe went off without a hitch as far as currency policy is concerned.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday starts with the surprisingly good news relationship between the U.S. under Trump and two of Asia’s powerhouses: China and Japan and the rest of the week will keep investors busy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the week ahead, investors will hear from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen, who will appear before the Senate Banking committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services committee on Wednesday. Investors also will be watching U.K. consumer inflation data closely on Tuesday, as it could firm up expectations that British interest rates are headed higher.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock investors look forward to the final resolution of lower taxes and fiscal spending. Both of these plans are thus far, however, lacking in detail. The Trump administration says it will be announcing tax reforms in the near-future, and this announcement could potentially propel stocks even higher.</span>]]></content>

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold</a> drops down at $ 1,235.60 </i></b><b><i>(+9.30)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price $ 18.13 </i></b><b><i>(+0.23)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index goes up to 20,376.79  </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.34%)</i></b><b><i>, Stock market today!</i></b>
<h3><b>US Dollar </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollars keeps rising in value against currencies around the world, making the US manufacturing more competitive. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The USD Index is at its highest levels since the end of January now, and this is not allowing precious metals to stay vigorous. For now, US Dollar is moving higher on hopes that President Donald Trump will soon reveal a tax plan that is full of tax cuts. All throughout his campaign, and as recently as last week, Trump has commented with regard to tax cuts that are aimed at helping the beleaguered middle class.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week has a rather quiet start. There were not many changes in the way of fresh economic data to consider about, so investors are in a wait and see position. The market looks towards Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s key testimony to Congress over the next couples of days for fewer clues. However, her comments could be overlooked and used as provocative for a stock market, if she doesn’t provide much information.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets should definitely watch for Yellen’s view on the United States growth outlook and her view on the impact of Trump’s proposed fiscal expansion on monetary policy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The focus on the breakout in U.S. stocks is overshadowing an equally important event: a  global stock market breakout. While U.S. is up roughly 3 percent for the year, the rest of the world is outperforming, including emerging markets. Japan and Europe up 9 percent and 5 percent. Large regional ETFs markets are also leading to 52-week highs, including Latin America, the Pacific.</span>]]></content>

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold</a> went up to $ 1,229.90 </i></b><b><i>(+3.40)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price $ 17.98 </i></b><b><i>(+0.01)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index goes up to 20,528.47  </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.12%)</i></b><b><i>, the Stock market today! </i></b>
<h3><b><i>US Dollar vs Precious metals </i></b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent rising strength of the U.S. dollar has been widely publicized. For companies with international operations, foreign exchange swings can have a meaningful effect on their top and bottom lines in an annual business forecast. Regarding this US dollar changes, US producer prices rose recently by a seasonally-adjusted 6%, which defeated expectations by a good bit. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metals did not make a huge move: <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> gained about two dollars over spot, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> finished exactly as it started on Tuesday,  Platinum and Palladium didn’t add much value.  </span>
<h3><b><i>Stock Market Today</i></b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen was in Congress on Tuesday for the first day of her semiannual testimony on monetary policy. In her prepared speech to Congress,  she made it very clear that she has faith in US economy and it’s definitely continuing to grow. In her speech to the Senate Banking Committee, Yellen said the central bank can continue to raise interest rates slowly although it would be "unwise" to wait too long. The market is waiting for the second day of Ms. Yellen testimony because she is usually careful about keeping to the same message across both days of her speech. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">More news comes from Europe. Germany central bank has completed a transfer of gold bars worth $13 billion from New York to Frankfurt, part of a plan to repatriate roughly half the reserves it keeps abroad. Germany has been bringing gold home from New York and Paris since 2013, and about 642 tons has been already transferred. As always, there are many views of logistics and the mechanic's reasons when a country transfer its gold from foreign central banks. Some analytics call it "demonstration of confidence”, some suggest the urgency in repatriating Germany’s gold has more logic regarding the latest Trump’s announcements European policy to US Dollar. </span>]]></content>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>US Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar rose strongly on the back of good inflation and retail sales data from the United States in mid-week trade.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week market watchers were expecting new comments from Greece economists. Greece is considering to leave the EURO in favor to US dollar, and  Greek economists started analyzing benefits into taking on the USD banknotes if the country turns its back on the European single currency. Experts consider this news are leading to the logical reasons why Germany central bank has completed a transfer of gold bars recently worth $13 billion from New York to Frankfurt.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The current US dollar situation did not do precious metals any favors whatsoever.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets climb to New Highs following Trump’s meeting with a group of executives from big name retailers such a Target and Best Buy on Wednesday morning. Major retailers have come out swinging against a provision of the tax proposal known as border adjustment, which effectively creates a new tax on imports. In the opening speech, Trump told that “his administration stays very focused on the issues that will encourage economic growth”.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.52% to end at 20,611.86, while the Nasdaq Composite tacked on 0.64% to close at 5,819.44. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial stocks, which benefit from higher rates, rose 0.74 percent. The utilities and real estate sectors, both of which do worse in high-rate environments, fell 0.39 percent and 0.30 percent respectively.</span>]]></content>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

Precious metals managed to gain slightly on Thursday as the Dollar backed off from a high growth.

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> prices continue rising in line with the weakening of the dollar across the board. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver</a> prices managed to pierce through $18.00 and it trades just above this figure, we can expect the silver prices also will remain buoyant during next week and maybe make good progress along with the gold prices as the pressure on US Dollar continues to exist.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold as the main instrument against the weakness in the dollar, seen over the past couple of months, is the center of all market watchers now. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks opened lower Friday as overseas markets traded generally lower and U.S. investors prepare for a three-day holiday weekend. Oil prices eased Friday morning leaving West Texas Intermediate just above $53 a barrel and down about 1% this week. </span>

Stock market strategists with the most optimistic outlooks this week say stocks could go even higher than their initial predictions,  supported by an improving economy, more profitable U.S. companies and hope that the New Administration will finally cut the tax.

		<title>Gold Targets $1,300</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several unique signals showing us that – barring minor intra-week corrections that could occur at any time – gold is set to move higher toward the $1,300 region before any more significant retracement may be due.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To arrive at this target, we examine both the relative strength of the gold mining complex and also the price action in silver. Based on analysis of these related but separate markets, we can conclude that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> itself still has further room to run over the intermediate timeframe.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us begin by examining the relative strength of the gold-mining sector versus the price action of gold bullion itself. Below we show the GDX large-cap gold mining fund on top with the price of gold immediately below it – stripped of all our typical annotations for a direct examination of relative performance.</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1320" title="GDX large-cap gold" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a_GDXGold-990x1024.png" alt="GDX large-cap gold" width="483" height="499" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The top green band shows that the gold miners are now back to a resistance level between 25-26 on the GDX fund, which was previously reached both last August and immediately following the Trump-victory in November.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two vertical grey bands correspond to these points in August and November. By following the bands downward, we can observe what the price of gold was the last time the mining sector was valued near 25-26 on the GDX fund.</span>

<strong>The last two times the GDX traded between 25-26, gold averaged $1,305 per ounce.</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The gold mining complex is intrinsically related to the price of the metal itself, as the sector’s profits are derived largely from spot bullion prices. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Closing the week at $1,238 as of the last trade on the New York COMEX on Friday, the mining sector is already pricing in nearly a $67 per ounce increase in spot <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To further the case for the $1,300 gold target, we turn next to the latest action in silver.</span>
<h3><strong>Silver Analysis</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Friday, we note that gold’s cousin rose for the 8</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> week in a row last week, rising 0.5% or $0.10 cents to finish at $18.03 as of the final bid in New York.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We maintain a target of $18.75 for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, based on the amplitude ($1.50) of the bottoming pattern observed prior to the breakout above $17.25 in late-January. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be rare for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver price</a> to achieve a higher target without gold moving higher as well, and so the silver analysis that follows has direct implications for the $1,300 gold target referenced above.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1321 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/b_Silver-1024x766.png" alt="silver price forecast 2017" width="840" height="628" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the break above $17.25 two weeks ago, silver has been behaving near-perfectly from a technical standpoint. The rise has been steady yet slow, leaving further room to advance on the RSI indicator (top of chart) before an overbought signal is registered above a reading of 70.</span>
<h3><strong>On Trendlines</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an important point that traders may wish to note on the silver chart. Our typical analysis is based on best-fit trend lines, to use the term from statistical analysis. However, as the highs composing the upper trendline do not fit perfectly (no trend lines ever will), and as we are anticipating a breakout with some volatility along the way, it would also be wise to identify an absolute-highs trendline. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is indicated above on the silver chart by the lighter dashed blue line.  Using an absolute-highs trendline, the declining primary trend would come in closer to $18.20.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Which line is more relevant toward the breaking of silver’s downtrend and the establishment of a new period of rising prices?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, the breaking of a best-fit line is most critical.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the absolute highs line is important to keep in mind solely for the reason that some traders will be focusing on it. We should expect some traders to treat it as the defining trendline for the primary decline which began in July 2016. As such, some short-term selling pressure should be seen there.</span>

In due time, those sellers at $18.20 should be taken out during the upcoming advance toward $18.75 if our technical targets are to be met. From that point onward, we will have to re-assess the silver’s short-term setup.
<h3><b>Silver is Leading Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having broken through the best-fit trendline of the primary declining channel (royal blue), silver now finds itself directly challenging the absolute highs trendline. While grinding price action lasting up to 2 weeks could be expected underneath the absolute highs trend line, prices should be well-supported by the $17.25 support level (black line).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect that the absolute highs trend line will be broken within the next two weeks, and when it does, the advance toward the $18.75 target will be quick, needing only 3-5 trading days to reach this level. </span>

Please keep in mind that silver, being an extremely small market at only $20 billion in annual physical sales, is prone to overshoot technical targets – both to the upside and to the downside. Should silver exceed $18.75 on this move, a surge to $19.75 is not out of the question as an overshoot by mid-April.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we observe the price action around the next high, we will begin to gauge the potential for an intermediate retracement. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The price action of both metals is set to get increasingly volatile through 2017, but as the investment adage goes: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“with volatility comes opportunity”.</span></i>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price today $1,239.60 </i></b><b><i>(-0.20)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> Price $18.04 </i></b><b><i>(+0.01)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index 20,624.05 </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.02%)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that the US is on holiday today in celebration of President’s Day, trading likely to be rather low-key throughout the session. There are also no economic reports scheduled for release today. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metals prices are little changed this  morning. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> keeps raising its ascent even with some stronger than anticipated economic data. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The coming months may be very telling in terms of what the Trump administration may be able to accomplish. Current geopolitical uncertainty surrounding the administration and U.S. relations with Europe, China, Mexico and elsewhere may keep a floor under the price of gold.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. markets are closed today due to the President’s Day Holiday. Market analytics are waiting for upcoming economic data this week ( Weekly Jobless Claims, New Home State, Consumer Sentiment etc.). Stocks remain not too far from recent highs, and could potentially go higher.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The political dynamics of Trump, Brexit and Eurozone elections make forecaster is likely to be based on the unpredictability that politics tends to produce. Time will tell how these events might affect global economics and the prices of precious metals.</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - February, 21</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price decreased significantly to $1,229.80 </i></b><b><i>(-10.00)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver </a>Price $17.96 </i></b><b><i>(-0.16)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index 20,682.26 </i></b><b><i>(0.28% raise)</i></b><b><i>.   </i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar outperformed in overnight trade as markets looked at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">weekly statistical releases scheduled </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of Fed commentary that may boost near-term rate hike speculation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar has not been able to drive the likes of EUR/USD and GBP/USD lower while at the same time maintaining just enough strength to ensure upside is limited.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of traders suggest that USD may have 6% upside against major currencies for the coming 1-2 month. As </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with a rising political risk in Europe, USD likely to strengthen in the medium and long term perspective. EUR may drop to 0.98 for the coming 6-12 months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metals did not do much moving on Monday, and this is mostly due to the fact that US markets were closed. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> spot price drops today but investors continue taking the opportunity to buy bullion as a hedge against political uncertainty in the United States and Europe. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For this week the most exceptional market update will likely be economic data release and investors are still a few weeks away from the FOMC meeting. Investors will be looking for any further clues as to the timing of additional rate hikes by the central bank as well as the Fed’s assessment of economic activity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The eleventh-hour agreement to grant continued Greek access to bailout funding initially boosted the EUR-USD exchange rate on Monday. Today profit-taking results on the open market brought investors skepticism back and largely eroded these gains. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today the US Dollar has jumped by 0.5% against the Euro. </span>

		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price hits up to $1,248.80 </i></b><b><i>(+14.70)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, Silver Price $18.27 </i></b><b><i>(+0.22)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index 20,814.20 </i></b><b><i>(0.19% raise)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar retains a positive bias but has given back some of its gains after two noted data releases came in below expectation. The dollar is higher ahead after the FOMC release on Wednesday. Currently, market investors suggest Dollar could be able to maintain its recent good form.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> prices on Thursday hit a three-month high after Federal Reserve policy meeting. The dampened expectations of an interest rate hike in March, lowering U.S. bond yields and stalling upward momentum in the dollar will influence the market in the following months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the weekly chart shows, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> has moved higher over the past eight straight weeks and it has posted a new short-term high in seven out of eight weeks. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, precious metals still face some challenges, growing optimism over the global economy continues to support equity markets.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most exceptional news of this week came from the latest FOMC meeting. U.S. stocks rose to fresh record highs on Thursday,  thanks to upbeat earnings reports from Wal-Mart and Home Depot. On Wednesday night, the Dow Industrial Average hit a new all-time closing high, marking a ninth straight session of record closes. The last time it registered a record-setting stretch of the same length was in 1987. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Market analytics want to see whether it includes more clues on the scope for a rate hike in March. More details on promised government spending, infrastructure investment or tax cuts would likely push the dollar and U.S. asset prices higher and gold lower. </span>

		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price hits up to $1,260.40 </i></b><b><i>(+8.30)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver</a> Price $18.43 </i></b><b><i>(+0.21)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index 20,772.04 </i></b><b><i>(38.28% decrease)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The USD dropped against all of its major counterparts after FOMC release. The US dollar index is also trading lower today. The U.S. dollar continued to struggle as investors sold the greenback, taking it lower against all of the major currencies. The problem lies in yields, which extended its losses despite relatively healthy U.S. data.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The precious metals look to end the week on a positive note after continuing to rally the past several trading sessions. Spot gold briefly touched as high as $1,260/oz overnight before moving back to about $1,255/oz due to some profit-taking this morning. The yellow metal is still trading about $5 per ounce higher in New York.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Stock Market Today </b></h3>
Even though U.S. analytics have been worried about the tightening, Fed fund futures show that investors are not convinced that the next rate hike will be in March.  So while we firmly believe that the greenback will trade higher, it may not catch a bid in the nearest future.]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[US Dollar & Long Bond Update]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar Index, which measures the US dollar versus a basket of foreign currencies, is still perched precariously just above the breakout point of its 2015-2016 consolidation. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Closing the week at 101.1, the dollar must remain above 99.5 on the Index in order to avoid an extremely-bearish reversal pattern, which is tentatively taking the shape of a Head &amp; Shoulders top formation (blue callouts).</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1361" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1a-1024x609.png" alt="US Dollar Index " width="840" height="500" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial surge in the dollar seen immediately following Trump’s presidential victory was accompanied by a sentiment which suggested the new administration would reverse trade deficits, boost growth, and cut the US national debt. Yet the sluggishness of the dollar’s advance in recent weeks suggests that the market is having second thoughts about this initial determination.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From a sentiment standpoint, a bearish outlook for the dollar seems to be a possibility few in the mainstream media are contemplating – and for that reason, it represents a compelling contrarian viewpoint.</span>
<h3><b>Euro Fears? The Contrarian Stance</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, reports regarding the possible breakup of the euro-zone <img class="wp-image-1362 alignright" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1.png" alt="Bankers prepare for eurozone break-up risk. Financial Times" width="365" height="333" />have reached almost a fever-pitch, following the UK’s decision to leave the EU last June and uncertainty regarding elections across mainland Europe in 2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems “everyone” knows the euro is set to disintegrate over the next few years – and for that reason, we believe the trade is extremely crowded. As contrarians, when everyone knows that something is set to happen, we must at least ask the question: “Is there not an alternate possibility?”</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1363" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2.png" alt="Euro zone break-up fears back on the table with Italy expected to reject reforms" width="304" height="311" />While the Euro-zone clearly has a unique set of political/economic problems and may need substantial reforms, we must consider the possibility that most of this “news” is already priced in the currency.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, the fact that most investors are convinced of the euro’s imminent collapse leads us to strongly favor the stance that the euro is set to begin a multi-year advance. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And if the euro is nearing the start of a significant advance, the dollar should act conversely. As the largest component of the Dollar Index above is the euro (at 57%), a rising euro will cause the dollar to fall.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All else being equal, a falling dollar will tend to cause more investors to seek protection in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not want to call the top in the dollar prematurely, i.e. before we see a breakdown below 99.5 on the Dollar Index. However, the US currency is acting significantly weaker than it “should” be acting, given the two-year consolidation is seen prior to the breakout. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Something is not right with the way the dollar is behaving technically. If it does not manifest immediately, our best assessment is that dollar weakness should become evident by 2018.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Bonds</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonds represent US dollars to be received in the future. We continue to suspect that a generational timeframe top has been put in on long-dated US bonds. Shown below is the price of the US 30-year bond. Recall that the price of bonds moves opposite to yields, and so a record-high price equates to record-low yields.</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1364" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/3.png" alt="The price of the US-30 year bond" width="1015" height="603" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From a technical standpoint, tops after long-term advances tend to be characterized by an orderly advance which then becomes disorderly. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/01/09/us-bond-bubble-cracking/">US bonds</a>, we had observed an unprecedented 36-year advance in price, defined by an orderly (magenta color) rising channel from 1980 – 2016. The advance in bonds then became disorderly, taking on characteristics of a parabolic blow-off, and breaking the upper trend boundary (shown in blue, above). The top saw a price of 175 on the 30-year bond, which corresponded to a record low yield of 2.1%.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the blow-off, we observed a quick 17% drop in bond prices in 2H 2016. Such a quick drop from an all-time high suggests an initial exhaustion sell-off after an unsustainable advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are not expecting a collapse in bond prices immediately; however, if the above analysis is to remain valid, the 30-year yield at 2.1% should not be matched again – perhaps ever again in our lifetimes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following 36 years of rising bond prices, it is equally fathomable that the bond market could see 36 years of falling prices, corresponding to 36-years of rising interest rates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors had become accustomed to buying bonds for safety over the last generation. Years of falling bond prices should represent an important component of the long-term thesis for precious metals, as some of that safety-seeking capital that in the past would flow to bonds will be diverted in the future toward gold.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The size of the US bond market alone is estimated to be near $12 trillion. Meanwhile, at $1,300 per ounce, all of the gold ever mined in the history of the world is valued at $6.6 trillion (and nearly 50% of that gold is held in jewelry, mostly in Asia). We can see that it would not take a huge percentage of capital to flow from bonds to gold to cause a major price acceleration in the precious metals. </span>

		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price decreased slightly to $1,258.40 </i></b><b><i>(-1.30)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> Price $18.48 </i></b><b><i>(+0.02)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index 20,818.55 </i></b><b><i>(-0.09 % decrease)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday precious metals opened day trading in much the same way they were through the last week. Helping precious metals for yet another trading session was a weaker US Dollar. Silver opened this week at $18.00 USD per ounce and experienced very little movement in price until late in the week. Gold received support from a positive global trend and didn’t  have any significant changes at the beginning of the week. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With any impact from Trump's economic policies, investors are focused on whether current growth is strong enough to lead the U.S. Fed to raise rates in the near future.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors are also awaiting President Donald Trump's speech addressed to a joint session of Congress tonight. So far there is little sign that the new President's legislative agenda will include repealing and replacing Obamacare, a big tax overhaul, and a trillion-dollar infrastructure military program, that could influence <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> price immediately.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stock futures were flat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this morning after the Dow pushed its record high close streak to 12 sessions, its longest winning streak since 1987. Markets edged higher in the previous session. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 hit fresh intraday highs. There are also lots of data on the calendar for this week. U.S. economic growth was a bit worse </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">than expected in the second estimate for the fourth quarter, with robust consumer spending offset by downward revisions to business and government investment. Most stock market analysts worry how fast  the U.S. economy would continue its "miraculous" boom. </span>]]></content>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price decreased to $1,233.60 </i></b><b><i>(-1.31%)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> Price $17.71 </i></b><b><i>(-3.67%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price">Platinum</a> Price $985.00 </i></b><b><i>(-2.86%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price">Palladium</a> Price $767.00 </i></b><b><i>(-0.90%)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones Index 21,065.77 </i></b><b><i>(0.24 % decrease)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, gold suffered one of its worst trading days in this year due to a stronger US Dollar that is trading firmer by hitting another six-week high. Silver hit a three-week low after a 3.5-month high on Monday. Gold and silver prices also fell by 1.31% and 3.67% due to an increased investor risk appetite and a growing notion that the FED will raise the interest rate at its upcoming FOMC meeting.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s first speech to Congress on Tuesday evening promised “massive” tax cuts for the US companies and middle class, and $1 trillion infrastructure investments, with no details about any health care reforms. The president basically reaffirmed his previous policy promises, which are expected to increase inflationary pressures.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After the President’s speech, investors now see a 65% chance that the FED will raise the interest rates later in March which will make the dollar rise. These growing expectations fueled the stocks rally on Wednesday. The hike in FED interest rates may also be pushed by a stronger labor market since FED is worried that the jobs market may overheat soon.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market backed off this morning after gaining record highs yesterday, as the Dow passed the 21,000 milestone and scored its best gains of the year. Investors caught their breath after the massive, record-breaking rally from Wednesday when they cheered the promises of infrastructure spending and tax reforms. After reaching 21,164.88 at 3 PM EST on Wed, 1st, the relief over Donald Trump’s message began to fade, and the Dow gave back 0.3% since it’s still not clear how the president will execute his plans.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Fed Hints at Rate Hike – How Will Gold Respond?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[I’ve long stated that the mainstream media consistently gets the relationship between gold prices and short-term US interest rates wrong. The charts clearly show over both recent and historical cycles, rising interest rates have corresponded with rising <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold prices</a> – not the opposite, as erroneously stated by the majority of the press.

For example, we’ve shown in the past the following two data sets: gold prices and short-term rates from both 2003 – 2007, and 1955 – 1980:

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1388" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/a_historic.png" alt="a_historic-fred-rates" width="1048" height="671" />

&nbsp;

In this case, the data as presented in the historic charts is extremely clear. And while we are officially told by the financial industry that <em>“past performance is no guarantee of future results” </em>when discussing historical trends, to completely disregard lessons from the past would be akin to saying <em>“past train arrival times are no guarantee of future train arrival times”</em> or <em>“past dinner prices are no guarantee of future dinner prices.”</em>

Sure, we cannot know <em>everything</em> about the future from studying the past. Things do change.

But we can know <em>something.</em>

And is not knowing something about what to expect in a given market better than not knowing anything?

&nbsp;

In this light, I continue <img class="alignright wp-image-1389" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b_Bloomberg.png" alt="bloomberg-gold-price" width="555" height="263" />to be amused and dismayed when I see articles such as this Bloomberg piece every time gold begins to get any attention in the mainstream press (see highlight circle):

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The article’s main point is that gold is behaving “counter-intuitively”, since it has risen after each of the Fed’s two interest rate hikes over the last year. The article goes on to state how rising interest rates are supposed to be positive for the dollar due to higher interest potential, and therefore negative for gold.

Does Bloomberg bother to look at the actual historic correlations between gold and short-term rates as we have shown above?

The main point of this editorial is to give an illustration of why I focus so heavily on charts and not on reported “fundamentals.” Many who believed the Fed would raise rates in 2015 for the first time in a decade stayed away from precious metals complex because they believed the fundamentals written in 99% of the mainstream financial press.

Even the respected economists all agreed on the fundamentals: rising rates are bad for gold.

The historic charts said otherwise.

As we observe the current cycle underway since December 2015, which form of analysis has been more accurate thus far?

&nbsp;

<img class="size-full wp-image-1395 aligncenter" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/c_recent.png" alt="recent-fred-rates" width="760" height="610" />
<h3><strong>Fed Hints of Coming Third Hike</strong></h3>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1396 alignright" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/d_Fed.png" alt="janet-yellen-puts-rate-hike-on-the-table" width="420" height="583" />

Friday was a fascinating case in point. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen gave a speech in Chicago Friday afternoon in which she strongly hinted that the US central bank would raise interest rates for the third time at this upcoming Fed policy meeting, scheduled for March 14-15. The most prescient quote from the speech follows:

<em>"We currently judge that it will be appropriate to gradually increase the federal funds rate if the economic data continue to come in about as we expect</em>. <em>Indeed, at our meeting later this month, the committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate</em>”.

Again, the standard narrative presented in the media is this: an increase in Fed-controlled interest rates should be US dollar-positive, as, all else considered, investors would increasingly choose to hold reserves in the US currency as interest rates rise, since they would be able to achieve a higher yield on these short-term deposits. This is the standard explanation for why rising interest rates should cause the dollar to strengthen, and hence precious metals to fall.

So if the above narrative were true, why did we observe the following reactions in the foreign exchange and precious metals markets immediately following Yellen’s speech? Let us look closely at the charts of both the US dollar index and gold on Friday.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1402" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/e_Fed_announcement.png" alt="fed-announcement-dollar-gld-index" width="904" height="797" />

&nbsp;

Notice that the US dollar fell after the hint of a rate hike, losing over 0.6% in just a few hours, while <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> rose nearly $8 in the two hours after the speech. <strong>This is the exact opposite to the pattern of trading that we are <em>supposed</em> to see with reference to Fed policy and major currency markets. </strong>The US dollar is <em>supposed</em> to rise and gold is <em>supposed </em>to fall on interest rate hikes.

The mainstream media has it flat-out wrong. Friday was a small example of that. Neither the dollar nor gold have behaved the way they are <em>supposed</em> to since the first Fed rate hike in nearly a decade, 15 months ago. We continue to see dollar weakness and gold strength appearing every time either a hint of a rate hike surfaces, or an actual rate hike is announced.

Considering that rates finished a 35-year falling cycle from the 1980 peak in 2015 and could reasonably be expected to be on a rising trajectory for many years or decades, this relationship is of utmost importance to get right.

Will the trend continue on March 15 if another rate hike is announced? We will know soon.

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price decreased to $1,226.70 </i></b><b><i>(-0.62%)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> Price $17.76 </i></b><b><i>(-1.03%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price">Platinum</a> Price $978.00 </i></b><b><i>(-1.81%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price">Palladium</a> Price $768.00 </i></b><b><i>(-0.52%)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones Index 20,923.04 </i></b><b><i>(0.39 % decrease)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A new Monday morning starts with a fresh look over markets by bringing you everything you need to follow up for making well-thought investment decisions during the next 5 days.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">FedChair's strong hint on Friday that the interest rate is expected to hike in March sent the prices of gold and silver down to $1,226.70 (-0.62%) and $17.76 (-1.03%) per ounce. This significant decrease confirmed their sensitivity to the future rising rates and the boosting dollar. Yet this week promises a series of events that shall further influence the spot prices for days and weeks ahead.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin’s supremacy continues on Monday, as the digital currency’s price overtook gold last week, gaining more than 60% since the mid-January. This is another step for Bitcoin, as by the end of this week it may acquire its exchange-trade fund, but market experts are still skeptical that this will happen.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the biggest news will come on Friday as the Bureau of Labor Statistic should present a strong jobs report that is expected to justify the Fed’s hike of the short-term interest rates. One of the biggest worries regarding the Fed’s new tight policy is that it will be the first among its international peers which are still loose. Though, if the European Central Bank will express its intention of normalizing the money supply during its Thursday meeting, this may sustain the Fed’s decision of a higher interest rate.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US stock market started the week mostly lower, giving a quieter beginning to the trading week, with a 0.39% decrease in the Dow Jones index. Investor’s appetite for risk was curbed by Trump’s accusation that the ex-President of the US, Barack Obama, wiretapped him, as well as the latest geopolitical tensions happening in Asia. Some investors are worried that these accusations may distract Trump from his economic agenda that powered the last week’s record-rally.</span>]]></content>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price decreased to $1,214.40 </i></b><b><i>(-0.87%)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> Price $17.49 </i></b><b><i>(-1.49%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price">Platinum</a> Price $958.00 </i></b><b><i>(-1.84%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price">Palladium</a> Price $769.00 </i></b><b><i>(-0.26%)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones Index 20,934.70 </i></b><b><i>(0.09 % decrease)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong US dollar index and the future hike in interest rates work against the gold and silver market bulls making precious metals prices trade low. Gold hit a six-week low in the early Tuesday afternoon, decreasing by 0.87%, while the silver spot price is down with 1.49%, also hitting a four-week low.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, according to some market analysts, investors should not fear this lower trend, as gold may rally after FOMC meeting just like it did in December right after Fed’s latest rate hike. Besides, precious metals markets are still expecting one of the most important economic reports of the month – the Friday’s US February employment report from the Labor Department.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US stock market is in flux this Tuesday due to Trump’s vague promises on lowering drug prices and Republican’s bill that plans to tackle the health care reform. Dow Jones index fell by 0.09% while S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq lost 3.04 and 1.76 percentage points, continuing the quiet trading week.</span>]]></content>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The increasing idea of a hike in the US interest rate next week makes the US dollar index trading near steady again this Thursday morning, after hitting its highest level in five days on Wednesday. Gold and silver prices continue to struggle, decreasing with and 0.38% and 1.16%, and hitting their five-week lows.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the European Central Bank (ECB) held its regular monetary policy meeting during which it decided to leave the policy unchanged. However, the entire market is awaiting the February employment report presented tomorrow by the Labor Department and the next week’s FOMC meeting. Investors see a 90% chance that the FED is fully expected to raise the interest rates with 0.25%.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following ECB’s decision to maintain its loose monetary policy and raise its growth forecasts, stocks rose, although off their earlier highs. Dow Jones Index increased with 0.02% while NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 went up with 0.03% and 0.04%. While the traders digest the latest ECB monetary policy decision and data, Wall Street celebrates its 8th anniversary in a bull market today, the 2nd longest since the World War II. Though, investors are cautious, looking ahead to the February’s US jobs report which must be released tomorrow and shall confirm a strong employment rate.</span>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Gold & Silver Technical Updates]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<strong>Gold Analysis</strong>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> price fell for the second week in a row last week, down $25 or 2.1% from a week prior. The final print on the NY COMEX futures exchange was $1,201 as of Friday afternoon.

Minor support at $1,220 was lost this week, and we expect this area will act as short-term resistance on the next advance.

Further minor support should be seen at $1,180.

Unless you are a short-term trader (for which we encourage utmost caution in the current technical backdrop) we want to draw your attention away from these minor support levels and toward <strong>the primary converging pattern which must resolve itself by Q3 – Q4 of this year</strong>. That is: the converging of the 2011 – 2017 long-term downtrend (magenta color) and the new rising support line (royal blue) which began in 2015.

Short-term gyrations will take on less and less significance as the two primary trends converge and until one of the trends gives way. When two converging trends meet on a chart, one of them must necessarily break in favor of the other. The outcome typically results in a strong move in the direction of the breakout, as illustrated below by the green arrows.

Based on the trajectory of the trends now developing, this break in one direction or another will occur no later than November, as the trends reach an apex convergence. However, based on past years of observing these patterns, it is generally more likely that the pattern will resolve itself at least 2-3 months prior.

To gauge the likely outcome, we will be watching supporting indicators from silver, the mining sector, the broad commodity complex, and currency cross-pairs over the months ahead.

For the time being, we will be closely monitoring <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> action in the world’s historic store of wealth over the days immediately following this week’s Fed interest rate announcement, due Wednesday afternoon.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1434" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/a_gold.png" alt="gold-analysis-march-2017" width="1126" height="843" />

&nbsp;

<strong>Silver Analysis</strong>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver price</a> fell 4.6% or $0.82 cents for the week to close at $16.92 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.

Although the price has fallen below anticipated support near $17.25, the message of this market is of a retest of the broken primary declining (blue) channel. The breakout came five weeks ago (red callout), and it is common for retests of broken declining channels to occur at a lower price point than the original breakout, due to the fact that the channel is necessarily falling.

By falling rapidly for six out of the last seven trading days, silver has approached oversold status on the RSI indicator (top of chart), indicating a short-term bottom (at minimum) is due.

We expect <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> will be making a bounce from this channel retest, shown by the green callout, on the way to challenging resistance near $18.50 over the next month.

The downtrend breakout would be considered to have failed – a bearish sign that a deeper low is in store for the future – if prices fall more than $0.30 cents further and definitively re-enter the declining channel.

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday mornings start with a fresh look over markets. Follow up the latest events to make well though investment decisions during the next week. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar index begins the trading week slightly higher, continuing its price uptrend. Gold and silver spot prices settled down, being modestly higher in the early trading Monday, and breaking the previous 6-week streak of losses. These minor upside price corrections on the market are influenced by the future FOMC meeting this week.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last Friday, the Bureau of Labor reported that the US economy added 253,000 jobs in February (much more than the estimated 190,000), the unemployment rate decreased to 4.7 % and the average hourly earnings increased by 2.8 on an annualized basis. The report sets the stage for this week’s main event – the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the meeting, it’s widely expected that the FOMC will approve a quarter-point hike in its interest rate, the third in just a decade, which should boost borrowing costs across the economy. Fed officials don’t hide their desire to move the rate closer to a reasonable level after an extended period of holding it back because of the financial crisis.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of the last week, the stock market moved higher after traders digested the Friday’s crucial jobs report, indicating a 100-points gain of the Dow Jones Index. This Monday morning, the market was moving rather flat to slightly higher, flagging the traders’ preparedness for the very likely increase in the interest rate later this week. Therefore, the US stock market stays focused on Trump’s administration promises of pro-growth policies.</span>]]></content>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price decreased to $1,203.20 </i></b><b><i>(-0.04%)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> Price $16.90 </i></b><b><i>(-0.32%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price">Platinum</a> Price $937.00 </i></b><b><i>(-0.11%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price">Palladium</a> Price $744.00 </i></b><b><i>(-1.33%)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones Index 20,835.59 </i></b><b><i>(0.22 % decrease)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar index traded about 0.3% higher this morning while gold and silver prices are slightly lower, decreasing with 0.04% and 0.32%. However, gold and silver trading is still steady after their multi-week streak of losses. The focus of the precious metal market is the upcoming meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the heavy snow storm hitting the US eastern seaboard, the two-day meeting of Fed’s policymaking committee starts today and investors are eagerly waiting for its conclusion. The strong February jobs report presented on Friday is the final confirmation for the Fed that the time had come to raise the interest rates to prevent the US economy from overheating.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the rate is expected to stay below 1%, the Federal Reserve’s move still comes months earlier than markets expected due to the continuously improving economic conditions. Fed officials state that the move is not a political message towards Trump’s determination to stimulate the economic growth. However, it’s clear that Fed’s essential point is that it doesn’t want a faster growth.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US stock market had a lower opening this Tuesday morning as the traders are quietly anticipating the FOMC’s conclusion on Wednesday. Traders are focused not only on its interest rate hike but also its forecasts for economic growth and inflation. The Dow Jones Index is down with 0.22%, NASDAQ and S&P both decreased by about 0.4%. Besides, the blizzard may also temporary freeze major market actions, sustaining today’s quieter trading in the US stock market.</span>]]></content>

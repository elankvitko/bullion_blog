<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price increased to $1,211.60 </i></b><b><i>(+1.08%)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> Price $17.09 </i></b><b><i>(+1.45%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price">Platinum</a> Price $941.00 </i></b><b><i>(+0.64%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price">Palladium</a> Price $749.00 </i></b><b><i>(+1.08%)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones Index 20,904.91 </i></b><b><i>(0.32 % increase)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday morning, the US dollar index traded slightly lower while the silver and gold prices got up, increasing by 1.08% and 1.45%. The precious metals market is still quiet, anticipating this afternoon’s conclusion of the Fed’s policymaking committee meeting, but some analysts state that gold and silver prices may rally after its decision.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee (FOMC) began on Tuesday and shall end this afternoon with a conclusion about its policy. It’s widely expected that the Fed will conclude to raise the interest rates by 0.25% today, but investors are more focused on future increases that may come by the end of this year, as well as their potential impact on the markets.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As traders are waiting for today’s approval of the interest rate hike, the US stock market had a higher opening this morning. Dow Jones Index is up 0.32%, S&P 500 increased 0.45% and NASDAQ rose 0.35%. Today, FOMC shall announce its 2nd interest rate hike in three months and the 3rd in ten years, but most important, Fed will also release its updated forecasts that may include three further rate hikes this year.</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,225.80 </i></b><b><i>(+0.50%)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver Price</a> $17.29 </i></b><b><i>(-0.20%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price">Platinum Price</a> $955.00 </i></b><b><i>(+0.32%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price">Palladium Price</a> $766.00 </i></b><b><i>(+0.79%)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones Index 20,934.55 </i></b><b><i>(0.07 % decrease)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar index traded slightly slower, hitting a one-month low after Fed’s announcement of an increased interest rate. However, a weaker dollar has helped to rally the gold market, moving the gold price up by 0.50% to $1,225.80 per ounce. Silver spot price is down by 0.20% after hitting $17.58 per ounce earlier this session. Overall, precious metals prices ended the Thursday session sharply higher, reviving after a two-week meltdown in prices.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As it was widely anticipated, Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee concluded its two-day meeting yesterday by increasing its interest rate with 0.25%, setting Fed on a likely path of several regular hikes ahead. The Federal Reserve is expected to hike 2 more times this year, most probably in June and December, although the market was expecting four rate hikes in 2017.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As Fed confirmed its decision to increase the interest rate the second time in three months, the US stock market opened higher this morning. However, Dow Jones Index slightly decreased by 0.07% and S&P down with 0.16% while NASDAQ slightly rose by 0.01%, influenced by a selloff in health care which challenged the optimism from the increased rates.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Fed Rate Hike Results in Successful Silver Retest</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

If you have been reading this column for some time, you may have noticed that technical analysis can often show us the “what” ahead of time, but the exact “why” trigger typically remains to be seen.

In this instance, let us turn to the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> market, which has continued, over the last three months, to behave more precisely on a technical pattern basis than <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week we noted that the swift decline from $18.50 back down to $16.75 over the previous seven trading days constituted a retest of the breakout seen during the first week of February. The breakout occurred as prices exceeded the upper boundary of the price channel that defined the July 2016 to February 2017 decline. Subsequently, the fall seen through Wednesday of last week constituted a retest of that broken channel. Please refer to the turquoise lines on the chart below, along with the annotations for the breakout and retest:</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1476" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3.20-1024x766.png" alt="Primary Declining Trend " width="840" height="628" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, the charts can often tell us “what” is likely to happen, but the “why” usually remains to be seen.</span>

In  this case, it happened once again to be the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday which provided the bounce from the retest we anticipated on the charts. The 0.25% rate hike announced by the Fed on Wednesday was indeed met with weakness in the US dollar, and inversely strength in the precious metals complex -- most clearly seen on the silver chart above.

In sum, for the week silver rose 2.9% or $0.49 cents to close at $17.41 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX futures market.
<h3><b>Silver’s Primary Downtrend - Broken</b></h3>
Our charts change periodically as new information becomes available. In the above <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> chart, we have new information as to where large buyers are showing up – now visible just above $16.75 in the spot market.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned, the primary declining channel from July 2016 through February 2017 has been changed to the turquoise color (see color key, chart above). In this system of analysis, turquoise represents broken trendlines. Broken trendlines </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be kept in our minds for at least several months following a successful breakout – precisely for the reason that they are often retested by traders some point into the future.</span>

By changing the color of the trendlines from royal blue to turquoise (once broken), it allows a quick visual perspective that still recalls the former trend but does not distract from the newly emerging primary pattern.

In the case of silver, we have a new primary trendline, which must be drawn from the December 2015 low at $13.65 per ounce up to the December 2016 low at $15.75 per ounce. This is shown by the new dashed royal blue line on the chart. With two significant higher lows occurring exactly one year apart, we can now begin to define the support and resistance levels which will be important for silver for at least the remainder of 2017, and likely well beyond.
<h3><b>On Trendline Retests</b></h3>
Note that silver’s breakout from its primary down channel occurred in early February at $17.25 (red callout), and the retest of the same down channel occurred five weeks later, at $16.75 (green callout).

It should be apparent now the value in monitoring these technical trends.

Those who were not following this primary trend in such a manner since July likely would have experienced more fear during the recent quick correction which ended last week.

As we instead saw the correction as a retest of the broken trend channel, much of the potential fear was avoided.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those interested in applying this form of technical analysis, note that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">retests of downward trends may indeed occur at lower price points than their original breakouts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This type of lower retest can scare those investors who are only focused on the absolute price without regard to trend analysis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot get every single twist and turn correct every time, but as any traveler who has ever been lost in a new land without a map or compass will tell you: “Having some information is infinitely better than having none at all.” This has been our experience over many years of observing the precious metals – the charts are valuable maps that we have to guide us.</span>
<h3><b>Silver Going Forward</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, we reiterate that silver has successfully retested its second-half 2016 primary declining trend. Initial support should be seen between $16.75 - $17.25 on any weakness, labeled on the chart above. In a worst-case scenario, we could observe a second-retest of the aforementioned broken trend channel, in the price region of $16.50, which would correspond with the rising primary (blue) trendline from the December 2015 bottom.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our highest probability scenario at this juncture is that silver will begin to advance to challenge the February highs near $18.50, labeled Initial Resistance on the chart, at which point we will need to monitor related signals to gauge the possibility of a further advance toward the 2016 highs near $21.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,234.80 (+0.33%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.48 (+0.29%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $970.40 (+0.27%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $782.65 (+0.59%), Dow Jones index 20,936.39(0.10 % increase).</i></b>

A new Monday morning starts with a fresh look over markets by bringing you everything you need to follow up for making well thought investment decisions during the next 5 days.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S.Dollar suffered a bad previous week and its technical situation is looking increasingly dubious this week, slightly boosting a gold price. This week’s US economic data calendar is a relatively thin one, but the combination of the latest economic updates and market situation speaks for itself.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Durable Goods Orders on March 24, Friday, are the focus of this week for the U.S. Dollar although they are unlikely to cause much volatility according to Raiffeisen Research, who see a rise in orders for aircraft from Boeing offset by a fall in general capital goods buying.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The week ahead is thin on top data flow, putting the spotlight on a docket of scheduled commentary from Fed officials. Comments from Chair Yellen and Neel Kashkari – the President of the central bank’s Minneapolis branch. Kashkari is a new voting member, so investors will be hoping he provides some clarity on his decision for no change</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kashkari is scheduled to speak Thursday at the Community Development Research Conference in Washington. Fed Chair Janet Yellen will deliver the opening remarks at the conference. Besides that, seven other Fed policymakers are due to speak.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The economic data also includes House vote on the repeal of Obamacare on Thursday. The majority of experts suggest that bill are not particularly important for the market, and even if it does pass, the bill could see modification in the Senate. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Seems like this week market data will give traders some pause with a relatively light economic calendar.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review- March, 21</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price </i></b></a><b><i>increased to $1,236.40 (+0.13%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.56 (+0.45%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $972.30 (+0.19%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $788.30 (+0.71%), Dow Jones index 20,962.74 (0.27 % increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar is in a soft patch at present.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, it doesn’t mean precious metals will trade much higher, but it does mean they will likely at the least hold a bid if the dollar continues to slide. Meanwhile, some experts have an opinion that the current pullback is only temporary and that the U.S. Dollar will rise again. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors have been surprised by the currency's performance since the Federal Reserve announced an interest rate rise earlier in March. The main reason for the under performance is that investors are selling the Dollar as an expression of disappointment after the Fed suggested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> markets should only expect two further interest rate rises in 2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Market analytics look forward the several Fed members speaking this week which will tend to impact the near-term directional bias for the dollar.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock Market opens higher today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 46 points (0.3 % ) today, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">S&amp;P 500 2,366.98 (0.28% decrease) and NASDAQ Index 5,833.52 (0.30% decrease).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks showed a lack of direction on Monday and closed the day little changes. On the economic front, New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley is going to speak at two events today. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Early trading in U.S. Future Index suggests that Wall Street will open higher on Wednesday. </span>]]></content>

		<title>Introducing the 1st Palladium American Eagle. Low mintage -15,000 coins.</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The release of the first </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-1-oz-palladium-american-eagle-25-coin-bu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 1 oz Palladium American Eagle $25 Coin BU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a significant moment in American coinage, which will take the most recognized and demanded <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins/gold-american-eagle/gold-eagles">American Eagle series</a> into the new field of the precious metals industry. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seven years of studies and development, the US Mint announced that it will launch its first ever</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Palladium American Eagle in September 2017. One of the rarest precious metals on the market-palladium will join the </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-1-oz-silver-american-eagle-bu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">silver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-1-oz-gold-american-eagle-bu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gold</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-w-1-oz-platinum-american-eagle-proof-coin-w-box-coa">platinum</a> versions of the famous American Eagles line. This new program will be the first major change to the Eagle program since the release of </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-w-1-oz-platinum-american-eagle-proof-coin-w-box-coa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platinum American Eagle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1997.</span>
<h3><b>The history of the first </b><b>US Mint Palladium Eagle</b></h3>
The US Congress authorized the production of the first Palladium Eagle under the American Eagle Palladium Bullion Coin Act of 2010. The newest American Eagle is an extension of the American Eagle bullion series.  According to this Act, the coin will be stuck in several versions: Uncirculated, Bullion and Proof.

After the Congress passed the Act, the Treasury Secretary commissioned an independent third-party study ascertaining the market demand for the new palladium coin. The findings of this study were submitted to the Secretary in 2013 and were supposed to conclude over the economic feasibility of the coins’ mintage, hence determining their availability.

Public Law also includes an option for the U.S. Mint to strike American Palladium Eagles in collector proof and uncirculated qualities. If a proof is made, the law requires that they come from the West Point Mint.
<h3><b>What makes the </b><b>2017 Palladium American Eagle</b><b> so special?</b></h3>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>It’s the 1</b><b>st</b><b> official </b><b>US Mint palladium coin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Only a few mints around the globe use rare palladium in their bullion </span>production, <span style="font-weight: 400;">making the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palladium American Eagle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a highly exclusive coin.</span></li>
 	<li><strong>Only 15,000 coins minted! </strong>This is a very low mintage, and the coins are likely to be sold fast.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>It carries one of the Nation’s most beloved designs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - the “Winged Liberty” considered to be a major factor that will increase the popularity of the coin. This is one of the most beautiful designs ever minted in American coinage.</span></li>
 	<li><strong>A Proof version of the coin will be struck in 2018</strong> at the West Point Mint and bear "W" Mint mark. It will have the same design as the 2017 bullion version.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1524" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2.jpg" alt="Palladium American Eagle" width="805" height="450" />
<h3><b>The famous “Winged Liberty” design.</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The obverse side of the coin features the rendition of one of the most attractive designs ever featured in US mintage. Originally created by Adolph A. Weinman for the ‘Mercury Dime”, the “Winged Liberty” is considered as one of the most graceful artworks among collectors around the globe.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1523" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1.jpg" alt="Palladium American Eagle" width="401" height="401" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Struck from 1916 to 1945, the coin was called “Mercury Dime” due to its similarity to the Roman God Mercury. The artwork showcases the profile of Liberty wearing a Phrygian cap – a symbol of power and freedom.  Inscriptions include “LIBERTY,” “IN GOD WE TRUST,” and “2017".</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The coin’s reverse showcases another creation of A. Weinman, first designed in 1907 for the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Gold Medal. The artwork presents an eagle sitting on the rock and pulling a large tree branch. It is one of the most impressive and admired reverse designs in many years of American coinage history. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1522" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3.png" alt="Palladium American Eagle" width="480" height="480" />

The proof and uncirculated versions will also display a mintmark.
<h3><strong>2017 Palladium Eagle Program Development. </strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Mint has worked on securing a reliable list of vendors which shall provide sufficient palladium blanks that meet the Mint's specifications. The blanks must have sufficient dimensions to ensure the successful high relief rendition of the reverse and obverse designs. The diameter of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 Palladium Eagle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shall be between 32.7 mm (the diameter of the gold version) and 38.1 mm (the diameter of the commemorative silver coin). Each </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Palladium Eagle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coin will be issued with a face value of $25, being legal tender in the United States, and will contain 1 oz. of .9995 fine palladium.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before any of the coins may be produced, the Secretary of the Treasury must commission an independent third-party marketing study into the possible demand for the strikes. The U.S. Mint began researching potential palladium suppliers in 2016. However, the authorizing legislation requires the bullion version of a palladium American Eagle to be produced at any facility other than the West Point Mint. The research and development of the palladium American Eagle were carried in the Philadelphia Mint, where the developmental strikes for a palladium American Eagle bullion coin will be struck using dies based on artwork, which was approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
<h3><b>When will Palladium American Eagle be available?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">First Palladium American Eagle will be launched in September 2017. Like other U.S. Mint bullion, the American Palladium Eagle will be sold in a limited time range on US Mint network and then distribute to authorized retail dealers like </span><a href="https://trustedpmdealers.com/site/outside-redirect/https%253A%252F%252Fbullionexchanges.com%252F"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bullion Exchanges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The United States Mint has never issued a coin struck in pure palladium; this bullion is expected to be one of the most anticipated US Mint releases ever. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2018-w-1-oz-proof-palladium-american-eagle-25-coin-w">2018-W 1 oz Proof Palladium American Eagle $25 Coin</a> will be available at the beginning of 2018.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t miss a chance to buy </span><a href="https://trustedpmdealers.com/site/outside-redirect/https%253A%252F%252Fbullionexchanges.com%252F2017-1-oz-palladium-american-eagle-25-coin-bu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 1 oz Palladium American Eagle $25 Coin BU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on our website. </span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,248.70 (+0.36%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.61 (-0.05%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $966.50 (-0.48%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $790.15 (+0.89%), Dow Jones index 20,637.33 (0.15 % decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar continues to undergo a period of corrective selling pressures having lost points against other currencies. The US dollar index is down by 0.6% on Wednesday morning. This is the lowest level for the index since early February.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> price keeps increasing, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> was trading lower in an early market opening on Wednesday on account of subdued demand of precious metals from jewelers, investors, and industries. Traders believe that the gold price will go upper, especially following indications from the US Federal Reserve this week. Gold usually moves higher when there is fear, uncertainty, or volatility in markets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The big question at this point is how long this bout of weakness in the Greenback might last. By taking a ‘bigger picture’ look at the U.S. Dollar last months, we can see that price action is still bearish from the monthly chart analyse. Despite this, precious metals are still receiving a lot of support mostly thanks to the Fed’s recent decision to hike rates.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock Market opens lower today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 46.54 points (0.23%) today, S&amp;P 500 2,342.03 (0.10% decrease) and NASDAQ Index 5,798.86 (0.10% increase).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock indexes have moved backward at a fairly steady rate over the past 2 weeks. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">President Trump spent Tuesday selling the Republican health-care overhaul to skeptical House members, warning his party that failure would endanger his legislative agenda and their own political careers. Republican party leaders aim to move controversial healthcare legislation to the House floor for debate as early as Thursday this week. But they can only afford to lose about 20 votes from Republican ranks, or risk the bill failing since minority Democrats are united against it. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, some market participants attributed the slump in equities to fears that Trump’s legislative agenda as it pertains to Wall Street would face delays as the GOP-led health-care overhaul plans appeared set to struggle on congress.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors will keep an eye on speeches by several Federal Reserve officials this week for clues on the path of future interest rate hikes after the central bank last week raised rates for the first time this year.</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,253.40 (+0.37%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.75 (+0.79%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $969.60 (-0.25%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $804.95 (+1.78%), Dow Jones index 20,648.54 (0.06% decrease).</i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All of four precious metals (<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">palladium</a>) witnessed a rise in price on Thursday as the US dollar lost its points against the bucket of six major world currencies. Continuing to boost gold’s spot value is the fact that the US Dollar has been growing weaker and weaker this week. Investors suggest if the U.S. stock market does embark on a significant downside corrective move, the gold market would benefit appreciably.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of analysts believe that gold will continue to rise over the coming months. Although the consensus that the Fed will deliver only two further rate hikes this year, Fed members may be forced to talk tougher in the second half of the year, which could tighten yields and lead to a stronger US dollar. For now, a dovish Fed is likely to support gold.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock Market is barely moving today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 12.76 points (0.06% decrease), S&amp;P 500 2,349.52 (0.05% increase) and NASDAQ Index 5,822.25 (0.01% increase).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today a big vote taking place in the US House of Representatives, the House will be voting on whether or not to abolish the Affordable Care Act, also commonly known as Obamacare. Wall Street eagerly await a vote on the House’s health care proposal, because that could be a barometer for future Trump administration policies.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, investors monitor oil prices, which continued falling after of the Energy Information Administration said U.S. inventories rose by 5 million barrels last week.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Global market experts argued yesterday that the market could fall after a terrorist attack in London, one of the world's financial capitals, largely in their stride. But stocks held their ground on Thursday and don’t show any lasting reaction to the latest European terror attack.The focus is still on how much of the risk rally is predicated for the global market on future Trump policy.</span>]]></content>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> rose up a bit on Friday, and keeps looking stronger in the near-term because of the weak U.S. Dollar. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">Platinum</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> also open market today with a small change. The U.S. dollar keeps turning lower against other major currencies on Friday, as investors remained cautious ahead of a delayed vote on U.S. President Donald Trump’s healthcare bill on Thursday and as strong euro zone data sent the U.S. currency lower.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the FOMC interest rate announcement was made last week, gold and silver have been gaining value at a fairly steady rate. The precious metals complex enjoyed a strong week mostly due to the U.S. Dollar. The gold prices continue to trade near their range highs just below 1250 and the fact that they continue to trade strongly should be an encouraging sign for the bulls for the move towards the next target of 1260 in the gold prices.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock Market opens higher today: the Dow Jones Industrial Average gains 37.50 points (0.18% increase), S&amp;P 500 2,353.86 (0.33 % increase) and NASDAQ Index 5,849.52 (0.55 % increase).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The vote to replace Obamacare was delayed on Thursday as the Trump administration tried to bring dissenting Republicans on board. Trump has threatened to abandon the bill and leave Obamacare in place. Voting on health-care legislation is scheduled for late-afternoon Friday. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both stocks and bonds recorded gains this week, most precious metals prices also advanced this week. Global stock markets, including most in Europe and Asia, rose this week as fears of a rapid U.S. interest rate cycle dissipated. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Summarizing this week there were some actions that will impact the upcoming week, for gold and silver, the news was mostly positive despite the fact that spot values haven’t been changed intensively. </span>]]></content>

		<title>Inflation Outlook and Opportunity</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the central thesis for an emerging precious metals bull market revolves around an increased awareness by world citizens that the currencies they hold as savings are intrinsically worthless, any time we see significant weakness in a major currency we must place our attention there. And when the currency in question is the US dollar – the world’s reserve currency – the examination becomes even more prescient. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar has been weak recently, falling some 2.5% over the last two weeks. Suffice it to say, investors are having doubts that President Trump will be able to deliver on the promises of lowering taxes, increasing infrastructure spending, all while lowering the deficit. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more so, US dollar fundamentals are already “baked into the cake”, by which we mean this is the first time in world history that not a single currency is backed by anything tangible. As a result, world debt levels are at unprecedented highs, and the democratic system itself seems to dictate that politicians continue to print money to fund never-ending promises to their constituents. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexander Tytler, a Scottish judge from the 18</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century, summarized it succinctly, and we cannot disagree with him regarding the unsustainability of such a system:</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is always followed by a dictatorship.”</span></i>

&nbsp;

<img class="alignright wp-image-1553 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Article-1.png" alt="Percent changes in CPI for All Urban Consumers" width="497" height="485" /><b>Consumer Price Index</b>

We can see evidence for the continued debasement of the US currency all around.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent Consumer Price Index data (CPI), released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) a week ago, shows continued debasement in the form of a 2.7% annualized inflation rate across all items (red highlight circle). This means the value of money is declining by 2.7% per year – even above the Federal Reserve’s self-imposed mandate of a 2.0% inflation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While 2.7% per year might seem trivial, consider that 10-year Treasuries are yielding less than 2.4% per year, and a saver in a high-yield savings account would be lucky to earn 1.0% per year. These are negative real interest rates.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[A side note: entire books have been written on the inaccuracies in the BLS’s CPI statistics – in other words, the inflation statistics are generally under-reported. We do not disagree with these claims. For example, the BLS uses what is called ‘substitution’ in their methodology – meaning that if the price of wheat rises by a high amount due to inflation, the BLS will perform a substitution by assuming the average family will instead </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">consume corn. In this way they will leave out the price increase of wheat from the CPI statistics. This largely defeats the purpose of the CPI, which was originally designed to measure the price level of a stable basket of goods. Despite these flaws, the CPI is widely-discussed in the mainstream press, and it gives us at minimum an understated-baseline measure of inflation with which to examine trends.]</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, a 2.7% inflation rate, compounded, means the currency in question will end up losing half of its value every 26 years. So for a saver in US dollars, the Federal Reserve takes 50% of one’s purchasing power every generation through excessive printing of the currency.</span>
<h3><b>Money Supply</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We see further evidence for the relentless inflation through the Fed’s own data on M2 money stock. M2 is one of several metrics used by economists to measure the total quantity of dollars in existence, and it includes physical cash and coins, checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts. It is the broadest measure of money that is currently published by the Fed.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1554" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Article-2-1024x395.png" alt="M2 Money Stock" width="840" height="324" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Side note: an even broader measure of money supply, M3, was published by the Fed up until 2006. M3 included all of M2’s components, plus institutional accounts. The Fed stopped publishing M3 in 2006 claiming the costs were too high to compile and publish the data. This – from an agency that literally owns a printing press and can create money at will.]</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact remains that we live in a world in which monetary debasement is relentless by central banks, and this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has never happened on a worldwide basis in history</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In past inflationary periods, for example Germany during the Weimar hyperinflation of the 1920’s, citizens could protect themselves from rampant money printing by holding US dollars, which were backed and redeemable for 1/20 an ounce of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold </a>at that time.</span>

Presently, not a single currency is backed by anything tangible, and most central banks are engaged in similar policies as the Fed. The only place to turn if one desires to save hard money over time is precious metals.

The truth is, if we lived during a time of stable monetary systems, we would not want to invest in precious metals per-se. Precious metals would be money, or money would be backed by precious metals in redeemable form. One would thus hold precious metals as stable-value savings.

When an appropriate growth investment opportunity came about (such as a business, stocks, real estate, etc.), one would have the savings set aside and ready to invest. When he wanted to sell the investment, he would then convert it back into stable-value savings – precious metals.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But we don’t live in a world of stable values – we live in a world of consistently debased currencies. This presents one of the major challenges of our generation, but also one of the biggest opportunities.</span>
<h3><b>Opportunity – Is There Anybody Out There?</b></h3>
Opportunity arises when an individual sees something that the majority does not or cannot see. In the markets, we must have an opinion that is different from the sum of the other participants in order to make a profit.

If there was no difference in opinion between us and the market, there would be no opportunity for profit.

The opportunity to invest and to make a real return by ownership of precious metals exists because the majority of the world’s population does not yet recognize the unprecedented nature of the worldwide fiat system.

We can confirm this general lack of awareness by simple conversations with those in other communities. Step aside from any internet-based investment communities you may be involved with – and ask the average person you meet at a coffee shop or the grocery store or a bar if they have decided to allocate any savings to precious metals – the answer will almost always be “no.”

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most western citizens do not even know that it is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">possible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to own precious metals, let alone understand the relative merits of gold versus <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, various bullion products, or numismatics.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The point of this is that we must periodically disassociate ourselves from the niche communities we all participate in, and ask the question: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do the majority agree or disagree with us on the merits of owning physical precious metals versus fiat currency?”</span></i>

[If you can honestly answer that the majority of people agree with you and do own precious metals, please send a message to the editor, because I would like to know where this community is located. –C.A.]

Otherwise – as contrarians – we should celebrate the fact that very few people in western society see the value in holding precious metals, for herein lies the opportunity.

The opportunity exists because we disagree with the market at current prices. And if a small percentage of western citizens begin to agree with us – and then divert a portion of their savings into either gold or silver – the values of the metals will be forced upward by a factor of several multiples. There simply is not enough physical metal available for every household to move a portion of its assets into either physical gold or silver at today’s prices.

		<title>Daily Market Review - March, 27</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,261.40 (+0.24%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.17 (+1.43%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $985.30 (+0.68%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $807.20 (-0.75%), Dow Jones index 20,461.19 (0.66% decrease).</i></b>

A new Monday morning starts with a fresh look over markets by bringing you everything you need to follow up for making well thought investment decisions during the next 5 days.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> prices are up and hit a four-week high in early U.S. trading Monday. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver</a> prices hit a three-week high overnight. The US dollar has decreased over 2.5% the last two weeks and provided a great opportunity to invest in precious metals.  The market is still reacting to the news late Friday that the U.S. House of Representatives Republicans pulled their bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The major currencies outside US markets on Monday morning see the U.S. dollar index sharply lower and hitting a 4.5-month low overnight. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index is currently trading at 99.12, down 0.64% from Friday’s close and the worst level traded since mid-November 2016.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market pointed to a lower open on Monday, the major indexes hit their lowest levels in six weeks on Monday after Republican's pulled a healthcare bill: the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 58.67 points (0.28% decrease), S&amp;P 500 2,338.94 (0.22 % decrease) and NASDAQ Index 5,828.26 (0.01 % decrease).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock markets were unnerved last week by Trump's inability to get enough support for legislation to reform the U.S. healthcare system, a major 2016 election campaign promise of the president and his allies. The major investors suggest that politics, not economics, will be driving market moves for at least a couple of months ahead. So, the temporary focus on politics is perfectly understandable. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday likely to bring more talk and analysis of the fate of the GOP's American Health Care Act.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday brings Advance Goods Trade Balance, also Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak at a conference on Tuesday in Washington.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, on Wednesday the University of Michigan releases its monthly Consumer Confidence survey. The Pending Home Sales and mortgage applications will be also announced, which are essentially other measures of consumer confidence. Mortgage applications are expected to be lower, which is hardly surprising immediately following a rate hike, but actual new home sales are forecast to have increased by 1.8% in February.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday at 8:30 the February GDP data will be released.These numbers measure the actual growth in economic activity during February and given that the expectation for higher growth has driven most of the “Trump Rally” they will be closely watched this month.Also on Thursday, corporate profits numbers will be released. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday we will learn how much Americans have been making -when the Personal Income/Spending as well as PCE Price Index data will be released.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week’s numbers, therefore, will tell us more about the long-term effects of the new Trump policies.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - March, 28</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,259.10 (+0.28%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.25 (+0.32%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $968.40 (-0.36%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $789.85 (-0.13%), Dow Jones index 20,526.80 (0.12% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently trading around $1258, testing session tops, the precious metal's latest leg of up-move could be attributed to a modest US Dollar selling pressure. Silver was trading higher today, while the US dollar looking headed for lower prices.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There was hesitation with gold at resistance, but we gave a slight edge to a conviction in seeing a lower US Dollar Index (DXY) to at least keep precious metals buoyed in the near-term.  </span>What's truly important to realize is that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> stocks are, at this point, ready to shoot up, but the catalyst would be gold $1,300 and silver $19.00. Once this confirmation occurs, we will see a real change in the US market.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the US dollar was 19% higher versus the pound at 0.7978, flat versus the euro at 0.9207 and down 0.29% against the yen to 110.34 following heavy losses in the previous session after Republican leaders withdrew their support for his healthcare bill to repeal Obamacare last week.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts suggest that US Dollar has never been in greater danger of losing its dominant position as global reserve currency and payment standard.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market on Tuesday looked open track to open flat or slightly higher, despite a jump in oil prices: Dow Jones Industrial Average increased nearly 95.62 points (0.47% increase), S&amp;P 500 2,345.15 (0.36% increase) and NASDAQ Index 5,828.26 (0.19 % increase).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Commerce Department said in its advance economic indicators report on Tuesday that the goods deficit fell 5.9 percent to $64.8 billion last month as a decline imports outpaced a drop in exports. The U.S. goods trade deficit narrowed sharply in February, and inventories increased, which could prompt economists to raise their estimates for first-quarter. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Market participants are also waiting for speeches from Kansas City Fed President Esther George, Fed Chief Janet Yellen, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan and Fed Governor Jerome Powell, while Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer is due to be interviewed on CNBC.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - March, 29</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,253.90 (-0.19%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.22 (-0.38%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $956.80 (-0.04%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $788.30 (-0.90%), Dow Jones index 20,669.70 (0.15% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
Wednesday morning starts with a small breakdown in precious metals prices: all metals have bounced back slightly. Nevertheless, the move is relatively small and the session of US market is far from being over, it is definitely a very bearish sign. For now, today’s move is not something that changes the short-term outlook.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the morning reports the USD Index is testing higher to 99.65 bands today against major currencies. After 4-month lows in the mid 98.00s, the messages from Tuesday’s Fed-speakers collaborated with the upside impulse. </span>

Experts can consider a higher U.S. Dollar  Index today can be a negative sign for the precious metals, but additionally, if we focus on daily closing prices alone, then we can argue that there were actually no big changes at all.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold and silver prices did not lose too much ground in the today’s wake, but there is no clear way of determining whether today’s performance will translate into better performance for US Dollar throughout the second half of the week.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market opens higher on Wednesday, even the Dow Jones is turning a small drop: S&amp;P 500 2,359.70 (0.05% increase) and NASDAQ Index 5,885.72 (0.18 % increase), Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased slightly 48.81 points (0.24% decrease). </span>

The stock market news today is dominated by the  Brexit countdown as the UK’s ambassador to the economic bloc delivers the letter to the European Council in Brussels, announcing the United Kingdom’s withdraw from the European Union. The UK is the world’s fifth largest economy and there are serious concerns and ongoing debate about the likely impact on global business including the US market would be witnessed in the nearest future.

Wall Street is also waiting for the Consumer Confidence release. The first reports announced the pretty high results,  remaining an optimistic forecast that President Trump’s pro-growth  policies will go forward  despite a setback of the healthcare bill.

Oil prices were pushing higher  today after a large supply disruption in Libya. Still, traders will be eyeing a weekly inventory update from the Energy Information Administration on the state of crude stocks in the United State.

As we moving further into the week there is not many economic data forthcoming, but traders look forward to the GDP data release tomorrow and likewise the Personal Income/Spending report on Friday.]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - March, 30</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,250.60 (-0.24%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.27 (-0.27%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $957.60 (-0.61%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $788.30 (-1.04%), Dow Jones Index 20,736.70 (0.37% increase).</i></b>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>

Thursday morning started with a small breakdown of precious metals prices, with gold and silver prices moderately lower in the early U.S. trading day. The US Dollar extended its upside momentum today, briefly testing peaks above the 100.00 limestone, where it’s now looking to consolidate.

Dollar's strength during these last two days is probably more a function of the very strong US consumer confidence numbers, which the market saw earlier this week and the updates from the Fed in the past few days. Most Fed policymakers foresee at least two more increases this year. 

The index is seeing a solid rebound from a 3-month low hit earlier this week, and the bulls have gained some technical momentum.

<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>

US stock market opens higher on Thursday: S&P 500 2.369.88 (0.37% increase) and NASDAQ Index 5,916.28 (0.32 % increase), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20,736.70 (0.37% increase). The U.S. economic data due for release on Thursday includes the weekly jobless claims report, the final estimate of the fourth-quarter gross domestic product, and the fourth-quarter corporate profits data. Also, the February GDP data was released on this morning. 

The final fourth quarter GDP estimate upwardly revised the annualized growth number to 2.1% from the previous 1.9%. It also exceeded expectations of a 2.0% growth, coming on the back of a strong consumer spending which was associated with a rise in imports. Regarding weekly jobless claims, those fell to 258,000 during the previous week from 261,000 the week before. Despite the fall, the number of claimants has decreased less than expected, as forecasts pointed to 248,000 claims. The reading is below the 300,000 mark, that’s linked to a healthy jobs market for 108 weeks in a row.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,247.50 (+0.55%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.30 (+0.38%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $949.20 (-0.36%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $801.50 (+0.63%), Dow Jones index 20,686.85 (0.20% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar rose to a two-week high on Friday as a combination of technical trading and strong US economic data and potential weakness in the euro zone weighed down the continental currency. The U.S. dollar traded marginally higher against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.068 and the yen around 111.5.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metals, including silver, look poised to advance to higher levels. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> had a good week ending on Friday at the $1246 level, a gain of around $17 from the previous Friday's close. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver</a> ended yesterday flat, whereas palladium gained 0.63%, respectively.The overall sentiment in precious metals seems to be optimistic as global concerns keep piling up.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a  few global economic events play a substantial role in moving gold.The upcoming French election is causing uncertainty in Europe, which once again helps precious metals shine. In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Theresa May filed formal Brexit papers this week.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold and silver are still sitting pretty overall, at least for this time being.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market opens higher on Friday : S&amp;P 500 2,365.24 (-0.12%) and NASDAQ Index 5,908.62 (-0.10 %), Dow Jones Industrial Average  20,686.85 (-0.20%). </span>

March 31 U.S. stocks looked set to open slightly lower as investors prepared to lock in gains on what is likely to be Wall Street's strongest first-quarter performance in four years. US stocks looked to rebound after almost 2 weeks of fairly steady losses.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In economic news, Personal Income/Spending report was released today. The personal income rose 0.4 percent in February, in line with expectations, while consumer spending rose 0.1 percent, below an expected increase of 0.2 percent.</span>

On Friday, oil prices fell 0.8 percent after settling at its highest level in more than three weeks earlier. The commodity rallied after a weekly reading on domestic inventories showed a smaller-than-expected rise. Production disruptions in Libya also gave rise to crude prices.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive economic data in the way of GDP growth and declining jobless claims contributed to a buoyant overnight performance on Wall Street. In general positive US economic data drives market better this week.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - April, 3</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,252.30 (+0.09%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.31 (-0.10%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $956.40 (+0.02%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $802.00 (+0.21%), Dow Jones index 20,639.30 (0.12% decrease).</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A new Monday morning starts with a fresh look over markets by bringing you everything you need to follow up for making well-thought investment decisions during the next 5 days. Here is not only new Monday for the markets, here is also a new month. </span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar started the week on a positive note on Monday as some lackluster US data and comments from Federal Reserve officials gave investors few catalysts to build on their US currency exposure.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar index, which tracks the US currency against a basket of six major rivals, was nearly  100.390 today. It notched a low of 98.858 last week, its weakest level since Nov 11, in the wake of US President Donald Trump's failure to pass a healthcare reform bill last month.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, investors are waiting for the economic events, that could push dollar more than in a previous month. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In March <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> prices were relatively stable keeping up around 1,247.30 and precious metals traders became more bullish on gold/<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> prices. However, the big picture of the precious metals is still indicative and uncertain . Investors  consider that this in April we may be ahead of another big rally in gold/silver prices.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market opened slightly higher on Monday: S&amp;P 500 2,361.59 (-0.05%) and NASDAQ Index 5,914.29 (+0.04 %), Dow Jones Industrial Average  20,658.52 (-0.02%).</span>

March was pretty hard and uncertain time for a market, the experts suggest that  the long-term prospects are looking up in coming month.

Here is a  list  of  top  events that likely to impact US market this first week of April:

On Thursday and Friday President Donald Trump meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping  and Trump already has predicted a “very difficult” meeting.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday the Cower and Co will host  its “Future of the Consumer” conference in New York. This event is full with the interesting presentations about the leading companies.</span>

On Wednesday, traders get Fed minutes from the last meeting of the FOMC, where the members voted to hike rates. This should provide little new insight.  This week, five Fed speakers can shed current light on the rate path ahead.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the European Parliament will debate a resolution on Brexit , the  US market hasn’t reacted much before, but now traders will keep  an eye on. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday evening investors are waiting for Friday's non-farm payrolls report.</span>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[US Dollar & Gold Technical Analysis]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar remains at a critical technical juncture, and as the currency typically has an overwhelming impact on gold prices over the short-term, we place our primary attention there this week. </span>

After seeming to break down during the overnight hours in Asia a week ago, the US dollar abruptly reversed and moved higher last week, finishing up 0.8 points to close at 100.2 on the dollar index.

The dollar is whipsawing traders at present and is caught immediately in the crosshairs of an important technical battle.

Despite the failure to follow-through in last week’s breakdown, the dollar remains within the zone of former support, which may now act as resistance, beneath 100.5 on the index. This zone is shown in black.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1616" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Image-1-1024x608.png" alt="US Dollar Index " width="679" height="403" />
<h3><b>Dollar Continues to Make Lower Lows</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The important point about the short-term technical picture is that </span><b>the dollar has now put in three separate lower lows</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (99.5, 99.2, and 98.8) since the breakout from the 2015 – 2016 consolidation. This is not the sign of a market prepared to make another multi-year advance. The bids at the retest lows we observe (below 99.5) are not enthusiastic; rather, they are fading as time progresses.</span>

In a strong breakout of a multi-year consolidation, we might indeed expect one or two retests of the former resistance zone. Yet following these retests, a market should move strongly higher to hit the consolidation target (which was calculated as 108 on the dollar index).

We have seen no such strength in the dollar since its breakout. Instead, we have seen three retests – each one occurring lower than the prior.
<h3><b>Could the Dollar Rally?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the dollar does somehow manage to rally at this juncture – perhaps by some jawboning statement by the Federal Reserve about a “strong dollar policy” – we expect the US currency could stage a marginal final rally toward the aforementioned 108 target. If this does materialize, </span><b>we expect to see precious metals not sell-off materially, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">but instead to show relative strength – perhaps consolidating with slight downward bias – as the dollar makes its terminal advance.</span>

Essentially, the precious metals should anticipate that the dollar is in the final stages of its advance, whether or not the exact top print has already been posted.

In retrospect – this is exactly what gold and silver have done thus far during the past 15 months. Gold is up nearly $200 and silver up $4.50 even as the dollar is just shy of a 9-year high. We suspect buyers have entered the precious metals market ahead of time, knowing that the dollar was approaching an important multi-year top.
<h3><b>Short-Term Technical Considerations</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The next few weeks continue to be critical to monitor for the dollar. On the chart above we can see that the US currency is now “sandwiched” between its rising (blue) trendline from the May 2016 low and its falling short-term trendline (teal) from the January high, all the while sitting squarely within the 2015 – 2016 resistance zone (black double lines). This is a tight technical situation indeed.</span>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Gold Analysis</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold advanced nominally last week, rising $2.70 or 0.2% to close at $1,251 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.</span>Minor resistance was seen as anticipated below $1,265. The high trade for the week came in at $1,262. Minor support levels exist at $1,200 and $1,180.<img class="wp-image-1617 alignright" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Image-2-300x225.png" alt="Gold vs CRB Commodity Index" width="475" height="356" /></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The near-term technical situation remains largely unchanged from our most recent update, and is focused upon the resolution of the pennant formation (red highlight) visible on the chart above. </span>
<p style="text-align: left;">As this pattern is drawing closer to a resolution, we will begin to regularly track the precise figures which would constitute a breakout in either direction. Those levels are:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Upper boundary breakout -- $1,290 and falling.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Lower boundary breakout -- $1,155 and rising.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whichever of these boundaries breaks first, the resolution of this pattern will set the stage for the direction of the entire precious metals market for the subsequent 12-18 months. It will be an exciting remainder to 2017 to say the least!</p>

		<title>Daily Market Review - April, 4</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,252.30 (+0.11%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.42 (+0.27%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $965.70 (+0.17%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $811.00 (+0.55%), Dow Jones index 20,638.91 (0.05% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
Gold started a  new trading month, jumping $4 by settlement yesterday. The metal is now back over $1,260. Silver’s also trading pretty confident on Tuesday. Meanwhile, U.S. Dollar opened lower against the majority of currency.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold is looking fantastically more attractive as the market keeps pulling back from its record highs, with the Dow Jones falling for the eighth straight session this week in its longest losing streak since 2011.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of investors consider the timing couldn’t be better for gold. The dollar is plummeting, the stock market has lost over 80 percent of the gains it made, and gold is once again everyone’s favorite safe haven asset.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of investors Gold’s not just a simple safe haven investment. There is a new research that proves gold has the potential to do much more than just protect wealth. In fact, it could be the “magic bullet” your portfolio needs right now.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market opened lower on Tuesday: S&amp;P 500 2,355.78 (-0.13%) and NASDAQ Index 5,894.71 (-0.17 %), Dow Jones Industrial Average  20,637.50 (-0.06%).</span>

The investors exercised caution ahead of an important meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Xi and Trump will meet Thursday and Friday at Mar-a-Lago. Last week, Trump said via Twitter the meeting would not be easy.
The presidents of the U.S. and China are expected to discuss North Korea, trade, security, U.S. jobs, and currencies. Trump's past comments have raised concern over the potential for conflict, though some analysts said they see room for compromise.
The economic calendar in the U.S. on Tuesday includes the U.S. Trade Balance for February at 8:30 a.m. EDT. The U.S. trade deficit in January rose 9.6% to $48.5 billion, the highest level in nearly five years. Economists expect the trade deficit to come in $46 billion. Also on the Tuesday calendar are Factory Orders for February, scheduled at 10 a.m.
Markets are once again facing negative real interest rates and rising asset prices. That can clearly be seen in price-to-earnings multiples for equities which have consistently been on the rise.]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - April, 5</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,245.50 (-0.95%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.25 (-0.70%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $964.70 (-0.04%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $814.35 (+0.93%), Dow Jones index 20,835.82 (0.71% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
The U.S. dollar index fell 0.8 percent against a basket of six major currencies on Wednesday.

The majority of investors do not see the US Dollar breaking below key technical levels over coming months and therefore the under-performance seen thus far in 2017 is likely to fade.

Gold lost almost have been crawling higher 9% while silver lost 14%.

This week the precious metals appear to be building a base, still, waiting for news that will make it move.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market opened higher on Wednesday: S&amp;P 500 2,372.03 (+0.50%) and NASDAQ Index 5920.05 (+0.36%), Dow Jones Industrial Average  20,835.20 (+0.71%).</span>

The higher open of US market can be easily explained by the rise in oil prices and with ADP National Employment Report released earlier Wednesday exceeding expectations.Trading on Wednesday was higher, however, traders are still waiting for Federal Reserve meeting minutes and President Donald Trump’s meeting with his Chinese counterpart this week.

The Dow added 83 points to begin the day at 20,835 and the S&amp;P 500 rose seven points to 2,367 points. The American private sector added 263,000 jobs in March, according to the ADP National Employment Report released earlier Wednesday, a significant rise compared to the market expectation, which forecast 185,000 job additions.
Traders also look forward to the global oil market will focus on weekly changes in crude oil and gasoline inventories in the U.S., which will be announced later Wednesday by the U.S.' Energy Information Administration.]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - April, 6</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,253.20 (+0.19%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.27 (+0.32%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $957.40 (-1.04%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $803.20 (-1.13%), Dow Jones index 20,623.12 (0.12% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar rose slightly against a basket of currencies. Gold price holds high on Thursday, but generally, in trading, the precious metals come show the relative laggards. Platinum and palladium start the day lower, silver gained a few points.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong ADP jobs report yesterday pushed gold and silver prices a bit lower and precious metals keep feeling pressure thanks to a USD Index that continues to recover slowly. Normally, the ADP report doesn’t get a lot of attention from investors, but because investors are still in an anxious and indecisive mood, with stock markets showing no clear trend in either direction, this report was overvalued. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The traders look forward to China’s President Xi Jinping and President Trump </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">meeting today, worry about a rift between the world’s top two economies. Signs that the two leaders could find common ground may downgrade fears and remove a perceived barrier to continued Fed rate hikes, sending the US Dollar upward. The dollar's loss in value recently time means that imports from places other than China or Japan will cost more and more for US market. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The news of missile firing by North Korea into the sea on Wednesday, a day before US President Donald Trump’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping took the US Dollar Index back low in value.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market opened higher on Thursday: S&amp;P 500 2,357.28 (+0.17%) and NASDAQ Index 5,874.35 (+0.17 %), Dow Jones Industrial Average  20, 623.12 (+0.12%).</span>

Wall Street ended lower on Wednesday after a late-afternoon reversal following signals from the Federal Reserve that it could change its bond investment policy this year, quenching a rally sparked by a strong private-sector jobs report. Also pressuring the market late Wednesday were comments from House Speaker Paul Ryan in which he indicated that tax reform is still ways off.

A key issue today: the meeting of China’s President Xi Jinping and President Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. Traders and investors consider this is the most important meeting of the year for US economy.  Between trade disputes and the threat of North Korea, the two leaders have plenty to discuss. Investors expect North Korea to be the main geopolitical issue at this meeting.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This meeting attracts a large amount of publicity, and investors will be watching the headlines, scanning for clues as to how President Donald Trump will proceed with China after repeatedly attacking it during his campaign. </span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - April, 7</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,267.70 (+1.13%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.45 (+0.54%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $969.00 (+0.70%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $806.85 (+0.09%), Dow Jones index 20,620.42 (0.21% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold price rose more than 1 percent on Friday to a 5-month high as investors sought safe-haven assets after the United States launched cruise missiles on a Syrian air base, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">potentially escalating tensions with Syrian allies Russia and Iran. Gold looks set to complete a run of four consecutive weekly gains this week.  Silver starts trading today with a little change from the previous close. Platinum price also climbed around 1 per cent to 969.00 per ounce. Palladium price changed slightly. Generally, palladium has a completely different dynamic to other precious metals. It is far more related to economic data releases, the expectations for the economy. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. dollar rose 0.25 percent against a basket of currencies after Thursday meeting of President Trump and Xi Jinping, and late-Thursday airstrike against Syria. The dollar index took the recovering course form being slightly lower earlier and is now up slightly in the session. Investors suggest that US Dollar Index is getting better but it's not getting better quickly. It appears that for now, gold is the preferred safe haven instrument being bought up by investors.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened slightly lower : S&amp;P 500 2,351.72 (-0.24%) and NASDAQ Index 5,859.16 (-0.33 %), Dow Jones Industrial Average  20,620.42 (-0.21%).</span>

The U.S. missile strike on a Syrian air base overnight caused a knee-jerk shift into U.S. stocks, although the impact was moderate as it is being interpreted as a one-off proportionate response.The main reaction was initially seen in the price of oil, which jumped to a one-month high in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, climbing by just over $1 a barrel to $56.08. Although Syria isn’t a major producer, the country is close to pipelines and routes that transport oil and fear of supply disruptions tend to push oil prices higher. Investors  will also watch out for March U.S. non-farm payrolls data due later on Friday, which analysts say could be key for the short-term direction of the gold market.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday is the second day of  Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping meeting, investors look forward to more updates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the investors overweight a weaker-than-expected March employment data this week, the Labor Department report showed that the U.S.created just 98,000 new jobs in March, marking the smallest gain in almost a year, as hiring cooled. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The conflict with Syria, a lousy employment data and ongoing uncertainty about the Trump administration could keep U.S. stocks and precious metals under the pressure.</span>

		<title>Silver Reverses Friday – Manipulation?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday saw a dramatic day in the precious metals market. In the aftermath of the US retaliatory strike on Syria, gold and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> both rose sharply higher in the overnight hours early Friday morning, only to reverse lower by the close of trading for the week. </span>

In general, short-term political and/or terrorism-related market reactions tends to be short-lived. Friday proved to be no exception.Let us turn to an examination of the silver market, which saw the most dramatic move on Friday.For the week as a whole, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> underperformed <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, finishing lower by $0.30 cents or 1.7%. The final trade on the New York electronic access market was $17.96.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1646 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Silver-1024x766.png" alt="Silver Breakout" width="646" height="483" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By failing to overcome the $18.50 - $19.00 initial resistance zone (black lines), this resistance level takes on increasing importance going forward. On any further weakness, we expect the $16.75 to $17.25 region to act as support at the low range.</span>

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1647" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Silver-Friday-300x245.png" alt="SLV Silver Trust " width="300" height="245" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The trading on Friday is worthy of further discussion. There has been mention in other areas within the precious metals investment world that the decline on Friday was entirely due to “manipulation.” On the surface, when we examine the intraday price action, it appears clear that this was not a normal trading pattern.</span>
<h3><b>On Manipulation</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are reading this article, you have demonstrated an interest in profiting from these markets, and not simply sitting idly as a passive victim of manipulation. </span><b>We aim to thrive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not to be victims.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If a market is so manipulated that it can never advance in our favor, we should move onto another market. The reason we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> involved in the precious metals is because we know that the sum of the participants are ultimately stronger than any attempts at suppression. Manipulation may exist, but it is not stronger than the market itself.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is no coincidence that the above selling took place just below the $18.50 level. Our charts had previously identified this resistance level. This was an important swing high from February, and sellers are appearing in this region once again.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We now switch over to the trading desk chart to examine the intraday volume on Friday:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1648" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Silver-2.png" alt="Silver chart on Friday" width="687" height="507" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A buying gap did indeed appear in the trading on Friday afternoon. </span>

However, the volume on Friday’s decline was not abnormally high. As can be seen on the chart, volume was higher at times during the consolidation and advance of the preceding two days.

When a drop such as this happens on moderate volume, it indicates sellers were met with relatively few buyers – not that an inordinate amount of sellers appeared. Such a reversal lower on moderate volume indicates that buyers were exhausted from the previous advance… and when buyers become exhausted, by definition it is sellers who remain. Thus, even a moderate volume of selling can cause a significant drop such as on Friday.

This is exactly the type of trading action that constitutes a consolidation. Sellers are making it clear where they desire to sell, and now we take a step back and observe where the next round of buyers show up. At each successive attempt to overcome the $18.50 - $19.00 resistance zone, futures contracts and physical metal are transferred from weak hands to strong – and when enough silver has been transferred in this way – the next advance will see an absence of sellers at the aforementioned resistance zone. The price can then advance to a new relative high.

Consolidations such as this are extremely healthy. Linear advances higher tend to not be sustained, as we saw in 1H 2016. To the contrary, advances followed by consolidations allow a market to move higher over the long run without drawing too much attention and without the extreme swings seen last year.

Longer-term investors should not be fearful to see a well-defined consolidation continuing at this juncture.
<b></b>
<h3><b>What Do the Silver Miners Say?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is sometimes beneficial to monitor the relative trading action in the silver mining sector and compare it to the price of silver bullion itself.</span>

These are two components of the same industry, and we sometimes see divergences which give us hints as to which direction the markets may be moving over the intermediate term.

Focusing for a moment specifically on the silver miners, which tend to exaggerate declines in silver lower if they are expecting sustained weakness, we note that the miners largely brushed off the precipitous drop seen on Friday afternoon in silver bullion.<img class="alignright wp-image-1649" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Silver-3-289x300.png" alt="Silver mid-week range " width="354" height="367" />

At right we show the SIL silver miners fund on top, and the SLV fund on bottom (silver proxy). Note how the miners closed within the mid-range of the week’s trading, whereas silver bullion closed clearly lower than the week’s trading range. This is the type of divergence we should expect if the miners are not anticipating sustained further weakness in silver bullion.

Silver investors can monitor this relationship to gain some insight as to what may be coming for the metal itself. At least over the short run and after <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/03/20/fed-rate-hike-results-in-successful-silver-retest/">successful silver retest</a>, the mining equities appear to not believe silver will be falling much further.

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A return to the prior consolidation zone between initial support ($16.75 - $17.25) and initial resistance ($18.50 - $19.00) would represent healthy basing action from a long-term investment perspective.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The old investment adage goes: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The longer the base, the bigger the move.”</span></i>

		<title>Daily Market Review - April, 10</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,251.70 (-0.32%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.95 (-0.77%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $944.10 (-1.40%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $806.85 (-1.85%), Dow Jones index 20,689.00 (0.16% increase).</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A new Monday morning starts with a fresh look over markets by bringing you everything you need to follow up for making well-thought investment decisions during the next 5 days. </span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar rebounded after losing ground and quite strong again. Gold dropped down on Monday on a stronger dollar, moving away from a 5-month high hit in the previous session, although geopolitical tensions continued to distract safe-haven demand for the precious metal. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver was already trading above its 200-day moving average  last week before it moved higher but it then reversed strongly and even below its 200-day moving average. Last week, Spot gold prices rose by 0.4 percent, to close at $1253.6. The market analytics expected that precious metals would pack to trade positive after the US launches a military attack on Syria building up safe-haven appeal, on Monday all four precious metals prices dropped down. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The probability of further military action against Syria and rising tensions with Russia could potentially keep safe haven assets for precious metals from falling too far. </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher : S&amp;P 500 2,358.72 (+0.10%) and NASDAQ Index 5,882.56 (+0.08 %), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20,689.00 (0.16%).</span>

Oil prices rose more than 1 percent, supported by strong demand, uncertainty over the conflict in Syria and a shutdown at Libya's largest oilfield.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at the Mar-a-Lago in Florida last week, in which the two leaders struck a friendly note. Some market participants looked at the meeting as a potential risk for stocks.</span>

There is no major economic data points set for release on Monday. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen speaks later today at an engagement in Michigan.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week’s economic calendar is light, with key reports reviews not out until Friday, that's why calendar doesn’t come into focus until the end of the week.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A few events this week: the preliminary April consumer sentiment index from the University of Michigan survey is also on tap (Thursday).  Other data during the week includes February JOLTS job openings, along with the NFIB small business survey (Tuesday), trade prices for March, along with the Treasury budget (Wednesday), as well as weekly initial jobless claims and March PPI (Thursday).</span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - April, 11</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,266.10 (+0.75%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.17 (+0.66%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $959.70 (+1.41%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $800.90 (+1.19%), Dow Jones index 20,606.56 (0.25% decrease).</i></b>
<h3>
<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar is dipping on Tuesday morning. Meanwhile, all four precious metals rose today, especially gold and platinum prices.  Gold price rose above rising geopolitical tensions buoyed, while US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen’s comments on gradual US interest rates rises yesterday had a limited impact. </span>

Gold prices are retreating from highs set in the wake of the surprise US missile strike on Syria last week. The US missile attack on a Syrian airbase prompted concern and an increase in safe-haven demand for precious  metals initially, that initial concern faded quickly. However, investors have plenty of global geopolitical happenings to discuss and consider.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Geopolitics remain another issue: US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attends a meeting with his G7 counterparts. Comments hinting that the US is now prepared to join efforts to remove Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad may boost regional instability concerns, driving both gold and crude oil higher.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened lower : S&amp;P 500 2,346.74 (-0.45%) and NASDAQ Index 5,881.53 (-0.52%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20,606.56 (-0.25%).</span>

After Monday's close, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the Fed was focused on allowing the economy to maintain its gains.Tuesday’s moves come as investors grow anxious about rising tensions in Asia, notably with North Korea, and as concerns grow that a presidential election in France could lead to the destabilization of the European Union, unsettling financial markets.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no major economic data points set for release this week. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least, what investors are most interested in this week is hearing from the bank CEO's who report earnings on Thursday. And with this is a week before the Easter Holiday, the things can come slow down. </span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,275.70 (+0.09%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.41 (+0.27%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $968.20 (-0.40%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $793.50 (-1.68%), Dow Jones index 20,628.75 (0.11% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar Index (DXY) is marginally higher in today’s trading, currently at 100.73, a gain of 0.02% over Tuesday’s close. Palladium and Platinum prices were trading lower on the early morning. Gold prices on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) were trading flat with a small change in early deals on Wednesday. Meanwhile, in general, the price of gold is rising on the back of a weak dollar and is slightly weaker against a stronger euro. Rising global tension around Syria and North Korea have pushed gold prices to their highest level since November as investors shift to safe haven assets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you put that mix together: Syria, Trump, North Korea, it’s a volatile thing, and it’s that uncertainty that investors are concerned about. The upcoming French presidential election is also adding to worries about volatile global politics, according to analysts, adding a risk-off mood may continue to translate into gold gains.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened lower : S&amp;P 500 2,349.76 (-0.17%) and NASDAQ Index 5,862.94 (-0.07%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20,628.75 (-0.11%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices, which hit five-week highs after last week’s U.S.-ordered airstrikes against Syrian infrastructure, followed by production outages from Libya’s largest oilfield, are now at their highest since December, when they got a huge boost from the OPEC historic deal to cut production.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets were watching for developments on the geopolitical front as US secretary of state Rex Tillerson meets with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow today.Tensions between the two military super-powers rose after Donald Trump launched cruise missile strikes on a Syrian airbase last week; a move that appears to have threatened Russia who has a heavy involvement in Syria.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, investors are keeping an eye on developments in the French election and risks surrounding Syria and North Korea, while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prepared for the first rush of corporate earnings on Thursday.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week’s economic calendar is light because of upcoming Easter weekend, that's why calendar doesn’t come into focus until the end of the week.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - April,13</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,289.00 (+0.17%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.65 (+0.42%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $980.50 (+0.38%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $803.75 (+0.12%), Dow Jones index 20,540.24 (0.25% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar slipped to a five-month low after Donald Trump said in his interview to the Wall Street Journal yesterday that the currency was getting “too strong” and that he would prefer the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates capped. “It’s very, very hard to compete when you have a strong dollar and other countries are devaluing their currency,” said Trump.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Currency investors responded immediately by selling the greenback. President Trump also said the upcoming report by the US Treasury Department wouldn’t label China as a currency manipulator. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After this announcement gold price is trading at the new weekly highs today. Silver price started a new day with a slight change. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of market strategists consider that unexpected geopolitical events like airstrike on Syria last week have a  short-live effect on gold, meanwhile, this US Dollar roller coaster definitely will keep influence gold price in the nearest future.  </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
U.S. stocks on Thursday opened lower: S&amp;P 500 2340.93 (-0.17%) and NASDAQ Index 5829.76 (-0.11%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20,540.24 (-0.25%) after Donald Trump words about U.S. dollar "getting too strong”.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices shed earlier losses and moved slightly higher on Thursday after an energy watchdog said the market is “very close” to a balance after years of oversupply. Oil prices also found support from a weaker dollar.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the light economic data this week, the majority of strategists are concentrated on the global political triggers for the stock market in the upcoming weeks. They expect market volatility to pick up around France's presidential election, the first round of which is April 23. Trump's first military foray into Syria last week was a bit of a surprise to the market, but it has taken it in stride. The bond market, however, could see a flight to safety if the situation escalates or becomes more uncertain. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial markets will be closed in observance of Good Friday, however, a batch of data are slated for the day because it isn't a federal holiday. Data include a reading of retail sales and consumer prices for March.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - April,14</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,289.60 (+0.08%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.63 (+0.26%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $978.30 (+0.02%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $797.20 (-0.06%), Dow Jones index 20,453.25 (0.67% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
Gold and silver prices ended the session higher and scored five-month highs yesterday. The gold market continues to see an updraft from safe-haven demand amid a rise in geopolitical tensions.The key outside markets on Friday with saw the U.S. dollar index trading lower following Trump’s negative remarks on the greenback. All US stocks are closed on Friday.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The three main U.S. indexes ended the week in negative dynamic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: S&amp;P 500 2328.95 (-0.68%) and NASDAQ Index 5805.15 (-0.02%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20,453.25 (-0.67%), and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stock and bond markets are closed on Friday in observation of the Good Friday holiday. Thursday was the final trading day this week and also the unofficial beginning of first quarter earnings season.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The investors have been largely focused on geopolitical headlines and  at the end of the week the tension was even worse after news that the U.S. military dropped its largest non-nuclear bomb on an ISIS tunnel complex in Afghanistan.</span>

Energy stocks led the broad decline, which gathered momentum in the final hour of trading ahead of the long Easter holiday weekend. The slide marked the lowest close for the stock market since Feb. 13 and came on a day when several major banks reported their latest quarterly results, kicking off the company earnings season.]]></content>

		<title>Gold Breakout is Approaching</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold is inching ever closer to a resolution of the primary converging pattern that we have been monitoring for the last six months. The resolution of this pattern is going to define the trajectory for the precious metals market into 2018, so it continues to deserve our foremost attention. We have supporting indicators from other markets, but we should always evaluate gold as a distinct entity. The price action over the last week has been encouraging, although not yet decisive. For the week, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> finished higher by 2.5% or $31, to close at $1,288 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX late Friday afternoon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two significant technical concerns at this juncture. Please reference the updated 18-month gold chart below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1697 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2011-2017-Downtrend-1-1024x767.png" alt="18-month gold chart" width="588" height="441" />
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold is once again immediately challenging the 2011 – 2017 long-term downtrend (magenta color), which has held prices lower throughout the entire multi-year decline. The exact figure we want to see exceeded and held on a weekly close is $1,290 per ounce to confirm this breakout.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The region between $1,310 and $1,337 represents “Trump Reversal Resistance.” This is the price zone that was tested on the evening of Trump’s presidential victory on November 9, before the $65 intraday reversal occurred in the early morning hours. This reversal lower occurred on the <b>highest single daily volume in gold trading history</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as can be seen from the red callout on the volume indicator above.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>High Volume Reversals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">High volume reversals are near-universally never exceeded on the first attempt to overcome them. The reason for this is the sheer number of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold </a>buyers who purchased futures contracts that day and are now underwater, and who then desire to sell at break-even when the price matches their entry level. Again, gold’s November 9 reversal saw the highest ever daily volume in gold trading history, and so barring an outbreak of major international war, </span><b>we place the odds of gold exceeding the $1,310 - $1,337 Trump Reversal Resistance at near-zero on its first attempt.</b>

Yes, international tensions are on the rise, as can be seen over the last two weeks with the United States retaliation against Syria; the US dropping the largest non-nuclear bomb ever detonated against ISIS in Afghanistan; continued saber-rattling between North Korea, China, and the US; and uncertainty regarding Russian support for Syria. Yet unless world superpowers are literally on the edge of World War III – an event we see as a low probability – the two technical resistance levels referenced above are the ones that will exert primary influence on the gold market here and now.
<h3><b>Early Indicator</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week we noticed early warning trend indicators coming from the gold mining complex. Note in the chart below how the senior gold miners index (HUI) has broken out through its similarly-shaped converging pattern (blue lines). At this juncture, it appears that the miners are hinting that strength is to be expected in gold bullion itself.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1698" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Breakhout-1024x766.png" alt="Breakhout in Large-Cap Gold Miners" width="565" height="422" />
<h3><b>Scenarios for Gold – Remainder of 2017</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The pending breakout pattern for gold will be important because the initial  target of the breakout is calculated to be equal to the 2016-2017 consolidation amplitude: roughly $330 ($1,378 - $1,045, rounded down). As gold’s consolidation reaches an apex at $1,205 (see far right, gold chart page 1), </span><b>the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/02/20/gold-targets-1300/">gold target</a> for a breakout is $1,535 within 6-12 months.</b>

The timing for gold’s next advance therefore depends on when it indeed breaks its long-term downtrend. Two scenarios are thus illustrated on the chart (page 1) above, highlighted in green and orange/red.

<b>Scenario A – </b><b>highlighted (page 1) in green:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short covering and/or geopolitical tensions result in a breaking of gold’s long-term downtrend above $1,290 within the next 2-4 weeks.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold’s short-term advance targets $1,320, as short sellers who were trapped between $1,200 and $1,260 cover en masse.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders holding futures contracts since November 9 (Trump’s victory reversal) exit positions between $1,310 - $1,337.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold stalls in the Trump Reversal Resistance zone and retreats to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its broken 2011 – 2017 long-term downtrend during Q2 above $1,260.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A successful retest of the broken trendline leads to the initial impulsive wave of the advance to target $1,535.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">(Readers may find the nature of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>’s retest of its broken second-half 2016 downtrend, discussed in recent articles, to be a helpful analogy for what we could expect for gold’s retest of its long-term downtrend, once broken.)</span>

<b>Scenario B – </b><b>highlighted (page 1) in orange</b><b>/</b><b>red</b><b>:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold fails to exceed its long-term downtrend within the next 2-3 weeks, and thus falls back to within the converging pennant consolidation.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support should be expected to emerge above the $1,180 - $1,200 support zones.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continued consolidative price action defines trading through mid-Q3 2017.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A resolution of the converging pennant must occur by Q3 – Q4 2017.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early technical indicators (HUI senior gold miners, gold/silver ratio) suggest this resolution will be higher. Target would remain $1,535.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;">Although a low probability, we must mention the downside risk. If the convergence resolves lower through a break of the 2015-2016 rising trendline (blue), gold would target $875 per ounce in 2018 ($1,205 convergence - $330 amplitude).</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold Prices</b></h3>
The next 2-3 trading weeks will set the trajectory for the remainder of 2017. A strong advance through the declining long-term downtrend sets the stage for a first challenge of the Trump Reversal Resistance zone, which should be followed by a retest of the broken line. We then expect a strong impulsive advance to target new highs for gold in 2018.

Conversely, a rejection at the long-term downtrend means gold must continue to consolidate within its primary converging pennant for Q2 – Q3. Early indicators suggest the eventual outcome will be higher, although a low-probability resolution to the downside must be monitored until proven otherwise.

		<title>Daily Market Review - April,17</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,289.30 (+0.11%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.60 (+1.08%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $986.40 (+0.80%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $793.90 (-0.55%), Dow Jones index 20,453.25 (0.67% decrease).</i></b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A new Monday morning  after a long Easter weekend and closed market on Friday starts with a fresh look over markets by bringing you everything you need to follow up for making well-thought investment decisions during the next 5 days.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar is lower on Monday, the index is down by 0.4%. However, gold hit a five-month high on Monday as the dollar weakened with investors taking refuge in safe-haven assets in the wake of rising geopolitical tensions over North Korea. The precious metals started week up, the yellow metal has gained 5% over the past four weeks, silver prices started in with a small change in the morning session.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Geopolitics have taken a turn last week, however, as what some consider fresh provocations by North Korea have increased already high tension levels between the U.S. and North Korea. The situation has increased to the degree that Vice-President Mike Pence has been dispatched to the region and there are discussions taking place about a potential U.S. offensive.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold is highly sensitive to the changes in the U.S. geopolitical situation. Investors suggest that gold will likely retain a measure of strength heading into the French elections this week, while ongoing tensions in North Korea should also keep the markets rather nervous.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
U.S. stocks on Monday opened sharply higher S&amp;P 500 2341.77 (+0.55%) and NASDAQ Index 5838.00 (+0.57%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20,575.62 (+0.60%). U.S. stocks rebounded sharply on Monday after a long weekend and as markets corrected higher following last week’s slump. The S&amp;P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.4% a piece.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most significant event is the French Presidential election on Sunday, April 23, and for much of the week, the most recent polls will dictate how the trades.</span>

Investors are concentrated on high-profile earnings reports this week, including Johnson &amp; Johnson and Bank of America Corp. U.S. housing and PMI data will dominate the data-driven headlines this week. Housing is said to ‘lead the economy’ so economists watch it closely – a strong rise or fall will be weathercock for the trajectory of the overall economy.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) will report on existing home sales. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the week ahead will feature a visit to Washington from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as well as data on U.S. housing starts and existing home sales, China's first-quarter growth rate and U.K. retail sales</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Geopolitical issues will remain in investors’ view this week, and could depress sentiment if tensions escalate. Over the weekend, North Korea put on a massive military parade, followed by a failed missile launch. In an unannounced visit to the Korean Peninsula’s demilitarized zone.</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,287.30 (0.14%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.46 (-0.54%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $989.10 (-0.68%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $788.70 (-1.26%), Dow Jones index 20,538.14 (0.49% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
The U.S. dollar continued to recover from a five-month low on Tuesday. Comments from U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, stating that a strong dollar is good in the long run, offset previous remarks from President Trump who last week said that the dollar is getting too strong and that it is hard to compete when other countries devalue their currency. Mnuchin also agreed that the dollar’s strength in the short run is hurting exports and the economy; based on such mixed signals, traders are finding it difficult to choose on which side to take a trade.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mnuchin sent another signal on tax reforms on Monday, saying that expecting one before August is highly aggressive and not realistic. Investor and traders are likely to start questioning whether Trump will be able to deliver on tax reform and stimulus but so far most signs are negative, thus another negative factor affecting the USD.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Four precious metals started on Tuesday with having lost in some value. Geopolitical tensions over North Korea pressured the dollar against the majority of a world currency. </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2341.69 (-0.31%) and NASDAQ Index 5842.07 (-0.25%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20,538.14 (-0.49%). </span>

Wall Street opened lower today, as a spate of weak earnings compounded concerns over this weekend’s French election and U.S.-North Korea tensions, helping to keep a lid on stocks.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks rose after three straight sessions of losses as investors shifted their focus to earnings and the greenback steadied after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said dollar strength is good over long periods of time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks gained on Monday with a positive outlook on first-quarter earnings. The Housing Market Index was reported on Monday. The index decreased to 68 from 71 with home builders reporting less confidence in the housing market.</span>

Generally speaking this week got off to a slow start was quieter on Monday as most of the world views as a continuation of the Easter Holiday.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week will also feature a visit to Washington from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as well as  China’s first-quarter growth rate and U.K. retail sales.</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,286.10 (-0.38%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.33 (-0.43%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $982.60 (+0.68%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $777.50 (+0.32%), Dow Jones index 20 486.48 (0.18% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold price slipped on Wednesday as the dollar recovered a bit from a three-week low hit in the previous session, but geopolitical concerns about North Korea and nervousness ahead of the French presidential election lent support to the safe-haven asset. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some chart consolidation and profit-taking from the shorter-term futures traders are also featured in gold and silver markets after both scored five-month highs earlier this week.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, we have seen geopolitics issues come keep tension among precious metals. Though spot values have been on the up and up in last weeks, the sideways to downward action we are seeing this week keeps investors attention.Looking ahead to the rest of the week, we can expect much of the same. Investors focused on geopolitics will remain through the end of the week and this will continue to support metals. </span>
<h3>
<b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened slightly higher S&amp;P 500 2347.46 (+0.22%) and NASDAQ Index 5888.41 (+0.67%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20486.48 (-0.18%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The key outside markets on Wednesday morning see the U.S. Dollar Index firmer on a mild corrective bounce from recent selling pressure. Oil edged higher on Wednesday as OPEC said it was committed to eroding a global surplus of crude, but increasing shale production in the United States and still-high global stocks threatened to pull prices lower.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual spring meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund take place in Washington this week. Companies reporting this week include Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., International Business Machines Corp., Netflix Inc., Heineken NV and Unilever.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Still on the front burner of the world marketplace are geopolitical concerns regarding the U.S. and North Korea stand-off, and U.S.-Russia relations. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, on Wednesday, the British Parliament approved by an overwhelming 522 votes against 13 May’s call for an early election, setting the stage what will define the terms of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union.</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,286.10 (-0.08%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.33 (-0.27%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $981.20 (+0.68%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $798.50 (+2.51%), Dow Jones index 20 440.00 (0.17% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
The U.S. dollar continued to recover from a five-month low against the majority of currency. After treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speech to the Financial Times that US President Donald Trump is "absolutely not" trying to talk down the strong dollar,investors consider the US Dollar is still unsteady this week, tensions over North Korea and looming French and U.K. elections that hold implications for the European economy have provided haven investor demand for precious metals in recent days.

Gold price is holding up well this morning, with spot prices little changed. Though investors are still very much paying attention to what is happening in Asia, worries surrounding a potential US-North Korean war have diminished significantly.

Geopolitical concerns remained to the forefront after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday that Washington was looking at ways to pressure North Korea over its nuclear program.
<h3>
<b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened slightly higher S&amp;P 500 2343.48 (+0.22%) and NASDAQ Index 5885.89 (+0.39%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20442.90 (+0.19%).</span>

U.S. stocks edged higher on Thursday as investors focused on a deluge of corporate earnings reports and economic data. All the main indexes gained a few points and started day trading higher. Crude oil's solid losses on Wednesday did give equities traders pause, but oil prices have rebounded a bit Thursday morning. U.S. stock indexes are pointed toward higher openings when the New York day session begins.

The world marketplace is still very aware of geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, and the U.S. and Russia. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday afternoon took a very hard line on Iran, too. Tillerson said the days of a passive U.S. stance against regimes like Iran and North Korea are over.

The first round of the French presidential elections will be held this Sunday. The second round will be on May 7. European market watchers are getting more nervous as the French elections approach and polls show tight races. The very existence of the European Union could hinge upon elections in the European Union this year.

Markets on Thursday will be watching a few economic reports, such as initial jobless claims.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,284.00 (+0.07%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.94 (-0.88%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $984.20 (+0.11%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $801.70 (+0.11%), Dow Jones index 20 586.17 (0.17% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
Yesterday saw positive movement in the precious metals thanks in large part to a softer dollar. The USD was slightly weaker, trending under 100.0 on the DXY index. Gold prices end at 1-week low as dollar recovers from 3-week low.

Investors expect gold prices to trade higher today as uncertainty looms ahead of the outcome of the French elections next week.
Gold struggled to hold this week's gains as the dollar strengthened and concerns over global risk eased. However, selling was relatively muted, which suggests a period of consolidation is now upon us.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened little changed S&amp;P 500 2353.33 (-0.11%) and NASDAQ Index 5912.55 (-0.07%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20586.17 (-0.06%).</span>

After a two-week losing streak, major indexes may cling on to their gains this week following Thursday's rally, which was driven partly by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's comments that an overhaul of the tax code would be unveiled very soon. Also corporate earnings and economic reports were positive on Thursday as more companies released quarterly results, and it helped US stocks to gain.

Investors are focused on the outcome of the first round of the French presidential election on Sunday.

Aside from political uncertainty in Europe causing global investors concern, the news that tax reform may be on the table “soon” has also grabbed the attention of the markets.]]></content>

		<title>Gold in Foreign Currencies</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the turbulence in the world political scene surrounding the French election, saber-rattling between the United States and North Korea, and uncertainty regarding Russian support for Syria, let us take the opportunity this week to update our perspective on gold as priced in major world currencies outside the US dollar. If <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/?p=1745&amp;preview=true">gold</a> was found to be violating important support levels across the globe, it would give us reason to question the trajectory for US dollar-priced gold at this juncture. Conversely, if gold as priced in foreign currencies remains strong, it would give us reason to anticipate that US dollar <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold</a> is set advance when we observe a breakout in the consolidation discussed last week.</span>
<h3><b>British Pound to US Dollar (GBP / USD)</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we examine gold as priced in British pound sterling, we should note that just last Monday the pound saw an important breakout versus the US dollar. Below we show the GBP / USD cross pair, from the final drop seen last October in the wake of  the Brexit vote, through present.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1746 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Triagle-Consolidation-breakout.png" alt="Triagle Consolidation breakout" width="527" height="371" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The breakout higher in GBP / USD occurred on Monday as the pound clearly exceeded the triangle consolidation (blue trendlines) above 1.255 which had formed following the terminal stages of the preceding decline.</span>

<b>This breakout signals a reversal higher in British pound sterling in the works.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The initial target for GBP / USD is calculated as 1.318, equal to the amplitude (0.083) of the preceding consolidation added to the apex (off chart, right) of the triangle, at 1.235. It remains to be seen if this reversal develops into a longer-term trend of strength for GBP / USD, but given our suspicion of a multi-year top forming in the US dollar itself, and that GBP represents 11.9% of the dollar index, this breakout should give an initial signal that dollar weakness is likely approaching.</span>

As the strongest periods for precious metals prices tend to correspond with the weakest periods in the US dollar, this breakout in GBP / USD bears monitoring.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[We note here that a reversal higher in GBP is occurring just at the depths of negative sentiment regarding the British pound. Most mainstream media outlets and investment channels have been expecting continued weakness in GBP. As markets so often do, the negative sentiment has already been priced into the current level, and the market has now reversed higher in the opposite direction as prevailing sentiment would seem to dictate.]</span>
<h3><b>Gold in GBP</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning to gold as priced in GBP, we see that the market still remains defined by the long-term rising linear trendline (magenta), which began in 2005. After breaking the 2011 – 2015 downtrend in a surge to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">£900 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in early 2016, gold then saw a follow-through surge above </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">£900 on the day following the historic Brexit vote.</span>

Note that following the climb to over £,050, gold then fell right back to £900 in December 2016, successfully retesting that breakout point.

Gold closed last week at £1,006.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot make short-term predictions about GBP-priced gold at this juncture, but the major point of this analysis is to determine if there are red flags as per the worldwide gold market that would give us warning signs as to US dollar-priced gold. We see no technical weakness from the long-term perspective in GBP-gold, and indeed this market looks set to re-challenge the £1,200 all-time high (set in 2011) on the next surge, likely within 12-24 months.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1747 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gold-in-British-Pounds-1024x609.png" alt="Gold in British Pounds" width="840" height="500" />
<h3><b>Gold in Euros (EUR)</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold as priced in the European common currency continues to look healthy for the continuation of a worldwide bull market, having closed the week at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">€1,202. We note the continuation of a similar long-term rising trend which began in 2005.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Euro-priced gold broke its 2011 – 2016 downtrend in early 2016, and the advance since then has featured a series of waves, the most recent of which clearly exceeded the prior peak of early 2015 (blue arrows). Lows continue to rise as well, the most recent low coming at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">€1,070 clearly higher than the early 2016 low of €970, itself clearly higher than the prior two lows of 2014 – 2015 (magenta arrows).</span>

We will want to see the rising long-term support line hold on any weakness in EUR-gold, just above €1,050. Based on the current trajectory, we can project that EUR-gold will retest its all-time high near €1,400 within the next 24-36 months, or slightly after GBP-gold.

<h3><b>Gold in Australian Dollars (AUD)</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, although gold priced in Australian dollars has remained stronger on a percentage basis than any of the preceding currencies, AUD-gold is the only one to have broken its rising long-term trendline back in 2013. The old investment adage, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The steeper the trend, the less important the break,”</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">comes to mind here, as since that technical break, Australian dollar-priced gold has been the only gold cross pair of major world currencies to retest its all-time high of $1,850, which it did in mid-2016 (red callout arrows).</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1749 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gold-in-Australian-Dollars-1024x608.png" alt="Gold in Australian Dollars" width="840" height="499" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The consolidation taking place since 2011 has taken the distinct shape of a cup formation – and it is likely that the retracement back toward $1,550 in December 2016 represented the “handle” of a cup-and-handle technical formation. For reference, the textbook definition of the pattern is shown below (courtesy Investopedia.com):</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1750 size-medium" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AUD-December-2016-300x266.png" alt="AUD December 2016" width="300" height="266" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon a break of the $1,850 all-time high, the target for AUD-gold is calculated as $2,400, derived from adding the amplitude of the cup consolidation ($550) to the breakout point. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We continue to anticipate that a breakout to new all-time highs in AUD-gold, for those who monitor such signals, will serve as an early-warning to holders of gold in other major currencies that similar breakouts are pending.</span>
<h3><b>Gold in Canadian Dollars (CAD)</b></h3>
Gold as priced in the Canadian “loonie” is one of the most precise technical markets clearly visible on the charts. CAD-gold closed at $1,740 last week, a mere 8% below the all-time high of $1,900 set in 2011.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we show CAD-gold since 2002:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1751 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gold-in-Canadian-Dollars-1024x608.png" alt="Gold in Canadian Dollars" width="840" height="499" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distinctness of the rising long-term (magenta) trendline should leave no doubts as to its importance.</span>

The low for CAD-gold was in 2013, at $1,250 per ounce. This major low was confirmed by the breakout in late-2014 of the declining trendline since the 2011 all-time high (red callout).

Note the well-defined structure of the rising trend since the 2013 bottom: a series of distinct higher lows and higher highs. The most recent higher low came in December 2016 at just below $1,500.

Gold in Canadian dollars looks healthy from a long-term perspective, and we anticipate it may be the second major world currency, following Australian dollar-gold, to see a new all-time high above the 2011 mark.
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold in Foreign Currencies</b></h3>
We perform these periodic reviews of gold in foreign currencies to remain cognizant of what is happening across the international investment arena. As a precious metals investor in 2017, you are indeed part of a worldwide movement.

We see no major technical warnings across gold as priced in any of the major western currencies. Initial retests of all-time highs have either already occurred, or they are expected to occur within the next 24 months. Significant advances following lengthy consolidations should be expected upon successful breakouts of these all-time highs.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The strength seen in gold as priced in foreign currencies continues to give us confidence that the worst laggard of the group <strong><i>(</i></strong></span><b>yet the most important for the worldwide recognition of a new bull market) – gold in US dollars)</b> <b>–</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not far behind.</span>

A new Monday morning after a first round of French presidential election starts with a fresh look over stock markets and economic calendar by bringing you everything needed news for making well-thought investment decisions during the next 5 days.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
All the international attention this weekend was addressed to French election. The gold price was weaker in the morning trading session today, after the first round of French presidential election. The result of the first round affected four basic precious metals:  Gold spot prices and silver spot prices are down, platinum spot price  decreased also, while palladium price continues to rise with a small change.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar index was also weaker today against a basket of six major rivals, was last down 0.9 percent at 99.115 today. There are no high-impact reports on the US calendar today, investors will stay focused on the geopolitical events and upcoming economic data this week.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2371.03 (+0.94%) and NASDAQ Index 5975.87 (+1.10%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20578.95 (+1.04%).

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock markets rose 1% on Monday, with major indexes advancing in a broad rally after a strong showing by centrist Emmanuel Macron in the French presidential election, which averted fears of a eurosceptic-only runoff. Emmanuel Macron's win in the first round of French Presidential election triggered a dramatic response in global financial markets. With the final outcome of the first round increasing the credibility of the polls, the market now seems to have started pricing-in a definite win for the Centrist candidate Macron against his far-right politician Marine Le Pen at the final run-off on May 7. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors were also waiting to hear more about a “massive” U.S. tax package that President Donald Trump said  is coming this week, which could revive the so-called “Trump trade” that started after his election in November, and which came in hopes that policies seen as pro-growth would swiftly pass Congress.Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday that he would announce a big tax-reform package on Wednesday. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday's session launches a massive week of earnings reporting, with nearly 200 S&amp;P 500 companies and more than a third of the Dow industrials due to report.</span>

		<title>15 Most Valuable US Coins</title>
		<content><![CDATA[Coins are valued by consumers for various reasons: investment, aesthetic appeal, numismatic value for collectors, and gifting are the top few. The value of a coin is directly related to how much it weighs, its content, purity, age and most importantly, its rarity. It is possible for a rare copper coin minted in the 19th century to be far more valuable than its intrinsic value but, the value of another similar coin would be a lot less if it is old but it is commonly available. A .9999 gold coin minted this year probably has approximately same value as its intrinsic value but it would be a lot more valuable if it is a limited release of a popular coin series, and is expected to be sold out soon.

<strong>Here is list of the 15 most valuable US coins:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li><b>1794 Silver Dollar </b>
Owning this “Flowing Hair Silver Dollar” minted in 1794 would be a dream come true for any serious numismatist. This rare beauty with her flowing hair has fascinated the numismatic world to such an extent that the coin was sold at an auction conducted by Stack’s Bowers Galleries for an astounding $10 million in 2013. That was a new world record price for any coin. The coin’s mintage was minuscule but was used heavily in circulation and served as a face of the young United States to the world outside. This is a popular image of the 18th century America.
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1771" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1794-Silver-Dollar-1.jpg" alt="" width="471" height="263" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li><b>   1804 Ten Dollar Gold Piece </b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In total only ten of these coins were produced, out of which currently only three are known to exist. Similar to the 1804 Silver Dollar, these coins were also minted in 1834, but dated as 1804. The only auctioned coin was from the King of Siam set and was sold for $8.5 million in 2005.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1772" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1804-Ten-Dollars-300x168.jpg" alt="1804 Ten Dollars" width="443" height="248" />
<ol start="3">
 	<li><b> 1933 Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle </b></li>
</ol>
Although 445,500 Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle coins were minted in 1933, today only a handful of coins are available making this collection highly  rare and valuable. These coins were never released for circulation due to Frank Roosevelt’s executive order suspending gold coinage and confiscating all gold coins in circulation for melting. Only 20 coins were saved from melting process as they were stolen and sold to the collectors. The secret services could recover 19 of them out of which 9 were melted. Nowdays, only a handful  coins remain and they are highly valuable today. One coin was bought by a private owner for a colossal sum of US$7.59 million in 2002.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1773" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1933-Saint-Gaudnes-300x168.jpg" alt="1933 Saint Gaudnes" width="432" height="243" />
<ol start="4">
 	<li><b>  1804 Silver Dollar </b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This coin has the limelight for its rarity and for the well-known fact,that it was sold for a whopping $4.14 million at an auction. There are only 15  coins available in the entire world and the interesting part is none of these coins were actually minted in 1804. All the coins were either minted in 1830 or later. The elegantly draped bust and bowed head Liberty is a design that all numismatists will want to own. The coin's rarity, beauty, and design is extremely popular in the numismatic world. </span>

<ol start="5">
 	<li><b>1870-S Three Dollar Gold Piece  </b>
This coin was produced from 1854-1889 and designed by James B. Longacre. The 1870’s coins are considered to be one of the rarest on the marketplace as only two of these 1870-S Three Dollar Gold Piece were known to be struck and only one is known saved now. Its believed that only one such coin existed and that it was struck to be placed in the cornerstone of the U.S. Mint building in San Francisco. The coin was minted using a special cast and has unique hand carved “S” mark. The coin is hold in the American Numismatic Association Museum in Colorado Springs  and its value is $4 million.
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1808" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1870-s-3-Dollars-300x149.jpg" alt="1870-s 3 Dollars" width="422" height="210" /></li>
 	<li><b>1849 Coronet Double Eagle </b></li>
</ol>
The Double Eagle is a one-of-the-kind coin, which mintage was inspired by the 1848 California Gold Rush, and changed the history of American Coinage forever. Till 1849 the highest coin denomination was $10, but the Gold Rush led to an abundant influx of gold into the US Mint, and hence an idea to produce a higher coin denomination. In 1849 only two pieces of Double Eagle coins were produced in proof condition, one of them is stored at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. and the whereabouts of the other coin is unknown. Many numismatics believe that if the coin was available its value would be $4 million. The coin was designed by James B. Longacre and features a profile portrait of Liberty wearing a small coronet.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

7. <b>1907 Ultra-High-Relief Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle </b>If this coin were not minted at the order of President Theodore Roosevelt, we would never witness this beautiful coin, designed by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. The goodwill to introduce American coinage to the world and Roosevelt's affection for Greek and Roman high relief coins motivated Saint-Gaudens to create this masterpiece. Although the coin was not accepted initially for its impractical design, because the high relief made stacking coins difficult, these coins are considered to be one of the most beautiful and valuable coins in the American history. They say that around ten of these coins is preserved in Fort Knox. Only two coins are out in the world, one is stored at Smithsonian Institute and the other one was owned by Egypt’s King Farouk.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1815" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1907-Ultra-High-Relief-Saint-Gaudens-2-300x168.jpg" alt="1907 Ultra High Relief Saint-Gaudens" width="423" height="237" />

8. <b>1943 Bronze Lincoln Cent </b>

In 1943 the Government of USA tried to conserve copper which was necessary for ammunition in World War II. The U.S. Mint began using steel blanks for the Cents in an effort to conserve copper. Over a billion "Steelies" (as they are known popularly) were struck by the three Mints combined in 1943; Philadelphia alone produced over 684,000,000 examples.  However, a handful of rare 1943 Cents has been discovered struck in error on old-style, bronze blanks. These bronze cents became one of the rarest coins in American coinage, highly sought after by passionate collectors.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1797" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1943-Bronze-Lincoln-Cent-300x168.jpg" alt="1943 Bronze Lincoln Cent" width="416" height="233" /><b></b><b>9. 1913 Liberty Head Nickel </b>

<b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is another rare coin in the American coinage history. This Liberty Head Nickel was produced in an extremely limited quantity and unauthorized by the US Mint, making it one of the best-known rarities among collectors. Only five of these coins are known to exist, and there is not a lot of information about their minting process. However, that was the first coin to break the million dollar barrier when at an auction.It was sold to Jay Parrino for $1,485,000 in 1996. </span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1798" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1913-Liberty-Head-1-300x168.jpg" alt="1913 Liberty Head Nickel" width="441" height="247" />

10. <b></b><b>1793 Chain Cent </b>

<b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the first  regular issued coin produced by the US Mint and also the first large cent in America. This coin was only struck  in 1793. Although, this cent did not pick up much commerce wise, this coin is highly regarded by collectors as a valuable coin.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1799" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1793-Liberty-1-300x168.jpg" alt="1793 Chain Cent" width="418" height="234" />11. <b>1885 Trade Dollar </b>

<b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This coin was designed by William Barber and only five proof coins were struck in 1885. This fact made this 1885 Trade Dollar extremely rare and valuable US coin. In January 2006 an authentic Dollar which was previously owned by  the legendary "King of Coins" banker, Louis E. Eliasberg Sr. was sold for $1.3 Million at an auction in Dallas, Texas, USA.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1800" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1885-Trade-Dollar-1-300x168.jpg" alt="1885 Trade Dollar" width="468" height="262" />12. <b></b><b>1873-CC no-arrows Liberty Seated Dime</b>

These Liberty Seated Dimes were minted at the Carson City mints and considered rare coins , because the mint functioned for only a certain amount of time. The Carson City mint also provided more limited series than other US Mint branches. The 1873 Liberty Seated Dime is considered to be one of the rarest coins in the American history. Due to the CC Mint record, 12,400 of these coins were struck when the standard for coin weights were changed. These coins were presumed to be melted and re-coined with the standardized weight and the addition of arrows on either side of the date. However, few of these coins escaped melting for assay purpose and a some pieces were saved for the mint storage. The last time this coin was auctioned in 2004 it was sold for $891,250.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1801" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1873-Liberty-seated-1-300x168.jpg" alt="1873 Liberty Seated Dime" width="461" height="258" />13. <b>Brasher Doubloon </b>

<b></b><b></b>This privately minted coin was produced by the popular gold and silversmith Ephraim Brasher in 1787. Although this coin is not technically part of the US coinage, it is still one of the rare coins produced in the USA. In 1979, a Brasher Doubloon  was sold at an auction for $725,000, which was a record lasted for almost a decade.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1802" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Brasher-Doubloon-1-300x168.jpg" alt="Brasher Doubloon" width="447" height="251" />14. <b>1893-S Morgan Silver Dollar </b>

<b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1893 Morgan Silver Dollars are the rarest coins among all Morgan Silver Dollars. The year 1893 brought several events that ultimately influenced the rarity of this coin. The silver purchase clause of the Act of July 14, 1890, was repealed on November 1, 1893, resulting in a drastically reduced need for silver to be converted into coinage. One of these coins was sold for $414 thousand dollars back in late 2001 at Stacks Auction.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1803" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1893-Morgan-Silver-Dollar-2-300x168.jpg" alt="1893 S-Morgan Silver Dollar" width="463" height="259" />
15. <b>1909-S VDB Lincoln Cent </b>

<b></b>When Victor David Brenner designed this popular coin and placed his initials on the reverse, he didn't think that one day these coins will go down in history. When the coins were released,  the public appreciated the coin's design but was not pleased with the prominent initials VDB on the reverse. The mint had no other option but to respond to the public by removing the initials in its next coin release. However,484,000 of these coins were minted at the San Francisco facility while the next releases were minted at Philadelphia facility. The SF mintage was considered to be limited comparing to Philadelphia and  made S Lincoln Cent extremely popular among collectors. Even some coins are in a bad condition, they still sold for a few hundred dollars at Auctions.

		<title>Daily Market Review - April, 25</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,268.80 (-0.69%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.76 (-1.34%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $958.00 (-1.00%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $801.80 (+0.36%), Dow Jones index 20 966.56 (0.98 % increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
After falling to the lowest levels since November on Monday, the US dollar is slightly weaker on April 25. The sharp rise in the euro yesterday after amid Macron’s lead in first round of France’s presidential election weighed on the US Dollar Index. The main factor which keeping the dollar’s losses is the expectation of a corporate tax reform plan by President Trump, that he announced last week. Corporate income tax is expected to be cut from 35% to 15%. The market is also looking forward to US economic releases scheduled for this week.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors expect gold prices to trade sideways today as uncertainty looms with regards to the two favorable candidates in the French election the second round result. Gold price and silver price are dropping for a second day on morning trading, the platinum price goes with a small change, meanwhile, palladium price slightly increased. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from the lack of big economic data or policy announcements today, the gold market also has run out of steam for the time being due to renewed investor optimism and risk appetite.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2388.07 (+0.59%) and NASDAQ Index 6019.43 (+0.60%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20966.56 (+0.98%).

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The market sentiment improved due to decreased geopolitical tensions amid France’s presidential election. The market is waiting for US CB Consumer Confidence data. The data is scheduled to be released at 10:00 AM EST today. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress returns from a two-week break this week facing a deadline to keep the government operating while President Donald Trump presses harder for some legislative accomplishments as his first 100 days in office wind to a close.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The research team at Danske Bank points out that in the US, Conference Board’s consumer confidence data for April is due and will be the key economic release for today’s US session after the sentiment tide turned sharply positive on Monday after the outcome of the weekend’s French election, Wall Street continued to keep a close eye on the political news. Investors await delivery on a pledge last week from President Donald Trump, who said he planned to release “a big tax reform and tax reduction” plan on Wednesday. The broad rally in U.S. stocks has been predicated on the follow-through of Trump’s campaign promises of lower taxes, less regulation, and more fiscal spending.</span>]]></content>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar edged up in trading on Friday but investors continue to monitor tension after a losing track for greenback against a basket of currencies was too long. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">General view that the US Dollar continues to struggle as US economic data surprises have turned lower, expectations of large tax reforms have been pushed back by Congress, and President Trump indicated lately that he would prefer a weaker Dollar.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Market analysts noted the main problem for US Dollar Index these last months that the US administration has failed to provide significant clarity and guidance on its proposals and, importantly, their implementation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices was a little changed on Friday, silver price and platinum price went down, meanwhile, palladium closes the week with a high increase. </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The major U.S. stock indexes closed with a little change this week, holding within 1 percent of their intraday highs, after the announcement of President Donald Trump's tax plan. Top officials called the proposal the "biggest tax cut" in U.S. history but remained vague on highly anticipated details such as the tax rate on repatriation of overseas profits.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">US President Donald Trump told Reuters in an Oval Office interview yesterday that a major conflict with North Korea is possible in the standoff over its nuclear and missile programs, but he would prefer a diplomatic solution. Investors suggest diplomatic solution for late geopolitical tension could have a huge impact on recovery of  US economy. </span>

		<title>Gold to Silver Ratio</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The gold to silver ratio (GSR), or the number of ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold, has not followed the timeline of the more aggressive move lower we were anticipating over the last several months. Instead, the ongoing consolidation between 65 – 74 on the ratio has moved toward the upper end of the range over the last few weeks, as <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> has remained steady above $1,260 yet <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver price</a> has fallen to the low $17 range again. </span>

Recall that a rising GSR tends to correspond with falling gold and silver prices, as was seen from 2011 to late 2015.

The final close on the GSR was 73.4 as of Friday afternoon.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1831 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Gold-to-Silver-Ratio-1024x609.png" alt="Gold to Silver Ratio" width="585" height="348" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the most important facet of the above chart is to note that the ratio remains healthfully below the 2011 – 2016 broken rising trend channel (turquoise lines). This breakdown has held for over a year. It would be rare for such a breakdown to reverse and make new highs during the current cycle.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the breaking of this clearly-defined trend channel which alerted us to the changing nature of the precious metals market in early 2016. Although the ratio has not moved lower in favor of silver for the last few months, it remains within the confines of an initial consolidation after the multi-year breakdown. Currently the ratio is facing significant resistance at the 74 level.</span>
<h3><b>Silver to Catch Up</b></h3>
Confirming evidence for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> to play catch up can be seen from a study of the momentum of the ratio’s recent advance, which has reached the highest reading since late February, 2016. The following chart contains the last two years of the GSR, with the momentum indicator (RSI) on top, the GSR immediately below, followed by the price of gold, and then the price of silver, all plotted along the same timescale. Let us examine it closely:
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time the RSI momentum indicator reached above 70 was in February 2016, when <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> had advanced to nearly $1,260, clearly exceeding the previous peak from 2015 at $1,190.  Even so, at that moment silver was “stuck” at $14.75, failing to eclipse its relative 2015 peak of $16.25.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We should recall this early-2016 episode carefully. </span><b>Many analysts at the time asserted that the move in gold was suspect, because silver was not “confirming” gold’s advance each day.</b>

We strongly disagreed at the time, and felt that other technical indicators were confirming a more significant advance to come in both metals. The lag in the move higher for silver was typical of an early-cycle advance in the sector.

<strong>What we can see at right is:</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time the GSR momentum RSI (top of chart) reached 70 this marked the absolute high in the ratio, February 2016.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright wp-image-1832 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Broken-2011-2015-Gold-SIlver-Ratio-Uptrend-203x300.png" alt="Broken 2011-2015 Gold SIlver Ratio Uptrend" width="276" height="408" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">February 2016 also marked a mid-point consolidation in gold after a strong advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver lagged gold’s advance, only to play catch-up over the next four months.</span>

The takeaway is that silver does not need to confirm gold’s move across every timeframe. Silver can lag for weeks, months, or even years in certain instances, and this does not negate the validity of gold, nor the eventual catch-up effect that is to be witnessed in silver itself.
<h3><b>2008 – 2011 Example</b></h3>
Consider an example from the last precious metals advancing cycle. Gold had peaked in March 2008 at $1,033 per ounce, while silver peaked at the same time at $21.50. After the crash of 2008-2009, gold regained its losses and went on to advance to several new all-time highs into 2010, first above $1,033, then above $1,100, and finally above $1,250.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All the while, silver remained below its 2008 peak of $21.50.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was certainly frustrating for silver investors over at least a 12-month period.</span>

<b>GSR with prices of gold &amp; silver: 2008 - 2010</b>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1833 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2008-Gold-to-Silver-Ratio-update.png" alt="2008 Gold to Silver Ratio update" width="435" height="642" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, was gold’s advance suspect because silver was not confirming it? </span>Or, was this an opportunity to accumulate silver, before the period of catch-up? The following extended version of the above chart will tell:

<b>GSR with prices of gold &amp; silver: 2008 - 2011</b>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1834 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Gold-to-Silver-Ratio-4.png" alt="Gold to Silver Ratio " width="419" height="618" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that the black vertical line shows the ending of the preceding chart. From that point in mid-2010, silver then advanced 180% toward its 2011 peak while gold advanced 25% over the same timeframe.</span>

The major point of this analysis is to be wary of analysts who claim that silver must confirm gold’s moves across every time period. As silver investors, we must be prepared to watch gold lead sometimes for weeks, months, or years. Other technical indicators must be used to determine whether or not we are in a primary advancing cycle in the precious metals. It is not sufficient to simply watch silver lag and label the move suspect.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The present opportunity looks ripe for silver to begin playing catch up over the near-term, even if there are further periods of lag to come as the metals advance through 2018. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our long-term target is for silver to reach at least 17-1 on the GSR, the level last seen at the 1980 precious metals peak of $850 gold and $50 silver.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A new Monday morning after President Trump finished commemorating his first 100-days in office over the weekend starts with a fresh look over stock markets and Economic calendar.  Our daily market review will bring you all needed news for making well-thought investment decisions during the next 5 days.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar got an early-week lift as Congressional negotiators reached a budget deal to avoid government shutdown and introduce a $1 trillion spending package. Gold prices were fairly lower when markets opened on Monday, the first trading day of May. Gold was  pressured by a sharp rise in U.S. equity markets, which rose as corporate earnings showed sustained improvement. Silver price went down,  platinum price and palladium price also decreased at the beginning of the week. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump increased diplomatic contacts with allies in Asia to secure their cooperation to pressure North Korea over its nuclear bomb and missile programs. Meanwhile, based on the late geopolitical events regarding North Korea, investors consider gold prices could continue to decrease throughout the week if there is a lingering threat of a military intervention.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2389.97 (+0.24%) and NASDAQ Index 6078.37 (+0.51%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20950.06 (+0.05%)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the International May Day, many markets across the world are shut for holidays on Monday. US Stock started trading slightly higher while the dollar weakened. Last week focus will be returning to eurozone politics with the second round of presidential elections in France at the end of the week. This week seems busy for macro news and boils down to investors reaction to the Fed and economic data.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The economic calendar for this week: March personal income (Monday), April vehicle sales are projected to rebound (Tuesday), MBA mortgage market indices are due (Wednesday), Initial jobless claims (Thursday). As you can see several key economic data will be released this week as monthly U.S. jobs report. The Federal Reserve's policymaking committee is also slated to meet this week, but they are largely expected to hold rates steady. </span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,253.90 (-0.28%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.92 (+0.23%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $930.20 (-0.72%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $819.00 (+0.17%), Dow Jones index 20950.70 (0.18% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar hit a one-month high on Tuesday because many European countries were on May Day public holiday yesterday and the US dollar bulls have used the opportunity of thin markets to break through some key levels. Gold prices dropped near the three-week lows again today due to the fears and risks globally in general. Silver price slightly increased, platinum price dropped in morning trading, palladium price also increased today. Investors will be looking at the important labor-market report, with April jobs this week. Meanwhile, in the current global economic uncertain environment, precious metals forecast looks highly unsteady.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2391.52 (+0.13%) and NASDAQ Index 6099.67 (+0.11%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20950.70 (+0.18%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stock futures were pointing to a mixed start for Wall Street on Tuesday ahead of a meeting of the Federal Reserve and earnings from tech giant Apple. President Donald Trump turned his attention to breaking up Wall Street banks yesterday, a campaign promise that has yet to materialize despite frequent chatter on the subject. Apple announces its earnings results on Tuesday afternoon, and given that the company generates a significant portion of U.S. corporate earnings, the announcement could move the broader market. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic calendar for today: Data on motor vehicle sales April will be released today. The Federal Open Market Committee will begin two-day policy meeting today.</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,253.90 (-0.32%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.73 (-1.01%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $914.00 (-1.88%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $805.40 (-14.8%), Dow Jones index 20913.42 (0.17% decrease).</i></b>
<h2><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metal</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar was fairly stable at the beginning of the week but US interest rates fell amid lower oil prices and US budget wrangling. US dollar is now in suspense ahead of the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision today The Fed will be out with its latest decision at 2 p.m. ET. Market analytics don’t expect the Fed to raise rates at the meeting. However, what they will be looking for is how the Fed appraises recent economic data, and the majority of analytics pretty confident that the Dollar will probably be put in some movement after this meeting. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Base metals prices are down an average, as investors sought higher returns from riskier assets and the dollar firmed as markets waited for cues that the United States may raise interest rates. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold price dropped today, silver price trades as three-month low,  platinum hits a four-month low, palladium prices also fell on Wednesday. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The focus for base precious metals today is definitely in the U.S. interest rate, markets are now speculating that next hike will take place at the June FOMC meeting.The U.S. dollar and political uncertainty in Europe also weights on the gold price.</span>
<h2><b>Stock Market Today</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2385.32 (-0.24%) and NASDAQ Index 6069.69 (-0.42%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20913.42 (-0.17%).</span>

U.S. stock indexes are opening lower, as gains in shares of industrial companies offset losses in the energy sector. Energy companies fell after oil fell to its lowest price in almost six months.
U.S markets are also weighed by an earnings-driven drop of Apple Inc. Apple late Tuesday reported earnings that beat expectations and raised its dividend, but “traders appear to be focusing more on sales results and sales guidance that fell short of expectations.

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,228.70 (-0.87%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.44 (-0.72%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $900.50 (-0.18%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $795.00 (-0.68%), Dow Jones index 20957.90 (0.11% increase).</i></b>
<h2><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metal</b></h2>
The U.S. Dollar Index increased on Thursday and hit more than six-week highs after the Federal Reserve announced it was still on track for two more interest rate hikes this year. The Fed announced that they will keep interest rates unchanged, downplayed weak first-quarter economic growth and emphasized the strength of the labor market in its statement following the end of a two-day policy meeting. However, there is still uncertainty as the economy is really on track for the Fed to raise interest rates twice more this year and to begin reducing its balance sheet.Gold price dropped significantly today, silver, platinum, and palladium also joined gold’s steep decline, dropping about 1%.

There are a number of economic, political and military events that trigger current gold price.
<h2><b>Stock Market Today</b></h2>
U.S. stocks on Thursday opened slightly higher S&amp;P 500 2389.90 (+0.08%) and NASDAQ Index 6075.92 (+0.05%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20957.90 (+0.11%).

<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market reacted positively to the FOMC statement, expressing confidence in the U.S. economy, and giving hope that it would raise interest rates again soon. Oil prices have dipped below $50 per barrel in recent days as optimism over a production cut strategy agreed between major producers has faded. American producers, however, have increased their activity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest French election news and last night’s final TV debate with centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron and far-right Marine Le Pen, indicated that Macron is still a favorite to win the second round of the elections this Sunday. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic data for today: Initial jobless claims, Consumer Credit.   </span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,230.80 (+0.04%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.36 (-0.48%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $913.10 (+0.80%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $816.80 (+1.26%), Dow Jones index 20936.17 (0.07% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metal</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Dollar Index futures are trading slightly higher today. Analytics suggest the direction of the index next week is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the French election second round on Sunday. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A rising U.S. currency makes dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies, potentially subduing demand for gold. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold price was a bit higher in the morning trading  still weighed down by a stronger dollar,  U.S. interest rate rises this year and  political uncertainty in Europe. Since the first round (April 23) of the French election, we have seen gold comes under geopolitical uncertainty pressure. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver price slightly dropped, platinum is up after the metal fell to its lowest since December yesterday, palladium price rose today over 1%.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened slightly higher S&amp;P 500 2394.13 (+0.19%) and NASDAQ Index 6087.92 (+0.25%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20936.17 (-0.07%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">French election has been one of the biggest concern for investors recently. Months of fierce campaigning is coming to an end in France on Sunday when Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen battle it out in the second and final round of the country’s presidential election. The U.S. stock market has proved recently to be quite pressured by multiple geopolitical threats and France’s presidential election also has a huge impact on base stock indexes.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to political analytics and the first election round, Emmanuel Macron’s seem winning the presidential runoff, but Marine Le Pen is entirely possible to win due to a phenomenon is known as a differentiated abstention. Her victory is likely to trigger a global equity selloff but the U.S. stock market will be the first to recover in this case.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Emmanuel </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macron’s victory is more "market-friendly" scenario. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional news: The government reported a strong gain in jobs for April on Friday morning, and the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since May 2007.</span>

<b>Economic data for today</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Unemployment rate, Nonfarm payrolls, Average hourly earnings.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Gold and the Fed Meeting</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold price</a> fell $41 from a week prior to close at $1,227 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon. This represents a 3.3% drop from the close a week prior.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A bounce is due, but we clearly see that the gold market wishes to consolidate further over the short-run. </span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1867 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2011-2017-Downtrend-1024x766.png" alt="2011-2017 Downtrend" width="549" height="411" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of the pennant consolidation breakout that must necessarily occur by Q3 – Q4 is not lessened by the consolidation that is underway – in fact, it is only strengthened in its eventual resolution. The more time that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> remains within the context of the consolidation defined by the falling long-term downtrend (magenta color) and the rising blue support, the stronger the breakout that will happen when this pattern is resolved. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Short-term traders are cautioned that volatility and thus opportunity for profit should subside as the consolidation progresses this summer and into Q3. The definition of a converging pennant consolidation is volatility that lessens as buyers and sellers each exhaust one another. The pending new market trend occurs because the next influx of large buyers or sellers is met by exhausted existing participants.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The boundaries of gold’s consolidation now come in at:</span>

<b>Upper boundary: $1,290 and falling.</b>

<b>Lower boundary: $1,155 and rising.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, over the short-run, we anticipate gold is due for a bounce, likely back to the $1,240 - $1,260 region, before consolidation continues through this summer, the technical action for which will be less meaningful within the above ranges until Q3. </span>Our 12-month target upon a breakout remains significantly above or below the $1,205 apex of the consolidation – $1,535 or $875 –  dependent on the direction of the breakout. This target is derived from taking widest amplitude ($330) of the converging consolidation and adding it to the apex of the pattern.
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fed Meeting</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/05/03/daily-market-review-may-3/">The Federal Reserve meeting</a> last week resulted in no change to the US central bank’s short-term interest rate target. The Fed funds rate remains at generationally-low levels, at a range of 0.75% - 1.00%.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The language accompanying the Fed non-decision is being closely securitized by the market:</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Committee views the slowing in growth during the first quarter as likely to be transitory and continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Translated from Fed-speak, this moderately-positive outlook suggests that the Fed will look to raise interest rates at its next meeting, on June 14.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We remind new readers that – contrary to the faulty-logic repeated in most mainstream media outlets – rising interest rates have most closely corresponded with rising precious metals prices throughout history.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, since the first interest rate hike in almost a decade in December</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img class="alignright wp-image-1868" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/US-3-Month-Treasury-Yields.png" alt="US 3-Month Treasury Yields" width="393" height="407" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">2015, each of the following hikes have been met by higher lows forming in the gold price:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>First Fed rate hike – December 2015</strong> – gold: $1,045.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Second Fed rate hike – December 2016</strong> – gold: $1,122.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Third Fed rate hike – March 2017</strong> – gold: $1,198.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our own proprietary technical model, which relies on 3-month Treasury yields as a leading indicator, indeed suggests that a fourth Fed rate hike is pending. At right we show the 3-month yields on top, with the price of gold immediately below, since 2015. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note how US 3-month yields have spiked several weeks in advance of each of the first three rate hikes. Essentially the Fed is responding in policy to higher yields in the short-term Treasury market.</span>

<b>The important point is that the rate announcements have almost exactly corresponded with major lows in the price of gold.</b>

<b>Gold Traders Have Been Wrong Three Times…</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At some point, we should expect gold futures traders – who have gotten this trade wrong on each of the prior three Fed rate hikes by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">selling in anticipation of the rate increase</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (only to see gold rise strongly against them after the announcement) – will wake up and cease this losing strategy. Thus, likely this year, gold may be expected to form its next intermediate low weeks in advance of the Fed announcement as traders wise up.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The futures market is also pricing in a fourth rate hike, as can be seen below by the 83.1% odds that traders are assigning to the pending outcome:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1865 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Target-rate.png" alt="Target rate" width="501" height="442" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Any gold price low above $1,198 on a fourth Fed rate hike would thus keep the trend of higher lows intact on the first four rate hikes since 2007. In a market that may be commencing a period of several years of additional Fed hikes, this trend bears continual monitoring.</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - May, 8</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,232.00 (+0.26%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.37 (+0.12%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $918.50 (+0.06%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $820.10 (+0.58%), Dow Jones index 21006.94 (0.26% increase).</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A new Monday morning after French election results and crushing victory of Emmanuel Macron   starts with a fresh look over stock markets and Economic calendar. Our daily market review will bring you all needed news for making well-thought investment decisions during the next 5 days.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metal</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Dollar Index futures are trading higher shortly on Monday. Early pressure came from a rise in the Euro as investors were waiting for the outcome of the French election. The Euro’s inability to follow-through to the upside then helped the dollar recover some of its earlier loss. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices increased on Monday after suffering several weeks loss, weighed down by US dollar and  also as global markets were analyzing Sunday’s French election.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2399.29 (+0.41%) and NASDAQ Index 6100.76 (+0.25%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21006.94 (+0.26%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The outcome of Sunday's closely-watched French presidential election is likely to set the tone for global financial markets this week. Stock analysts expect that the markets will move on from the election, because Emmanuel Macron's victory is definetly "market friendly".</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The week is pretty light as far as market-moving economic reports go. But there is one  report coming up on Friday that will get some attention.That's when the government will report the latest inflation numbers as expressed through the Consumer Price Index. The CPI puts together a list of goods and services and tallies up the price. There are a couple of important indicators coming this week, including CPI and retail sales. </span>

<b>The economic calendar for this week:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Optimism Index, JOLTS job openings for March (Tuesday), April Treasury budget (Wednesday), Jobless Claims, PPI for April (Thursday), Consumer Price Index, Retail Sales (Friday). </span>]]></content>

France's presidential election was one of the largest political risk events affected markets recently.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>

The unexpected news caused the US dollar to downsize recent gains. The dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of six major currencies, edged down 0.2% according to the latest reports.

<h2><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar climbed to eight-week highs on Thursday, and stay stable among mixed sentiment. Increasing expectations of an interest rate hike by Fed in June are supporting the US Dollar. Gold price might be sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced. On the other hand, US Dollar position is still questionable by the dismissal of FBI Director James Comey. The market is looking forward to the release of the Producer Price Index today. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold price slightly gained in morning trading, the silver price also increased, platinum and palladium prices rose less than 1%. </span>
<h2><b>Stock Market Today</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2393.26 (-0.27%) and NASDAQ Index 6108.05 (-0.33%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20918.01 (-0.12%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The major stock market indexes are weaker today, continue to stay under pressure after President Trump dismissal of FBI director. Traders will continue to monitor the indexes movement.  Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) crushed in after-market trading  after reported massive losses of $2.2 billion in the first quarter yesterday. Today investors’ attention is focused on The Producer Price Index (PPI) report- a weighted index of prices measured at the wholesale, or producer level. A monthly release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)  shows trends within the wholesale markets manufacturing industries and commodities markets.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,233.20 (+0.45%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.54 (+0.66%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $924.80 (+0.21%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $809.50 (+0.40%), Dow Jones index 20894.24 (0.13% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
US Dollar came under pressure on Friday morning trading, because of the disappointing reports on the American economy. Economic data on US inflation and retail sales for April let down Wall Street expectations. In addition to the dollar weakness, investors were also trading US treasuries, sending yields lower. The markets will be looking for today’s Consumer Price Index Data. Gold prices moved higher on Friday because the recent political events in the U.S. continued to weigh down the US Dollar and boost demand for safe-haven assets like yellow metal. Silver price slightly increased, platinum and palladium prices are also higher.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2390.93 (-0.15%) and NASDAQ Index 6117.39 (+0.03%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20894.24 (-0.13%).</span>

The major U.S. Index futures are trading lower opening on Friday following the release of a Commerce Department showing weaker than expected retail sales growth in April. The US policy uncertainty and weekly news from the new Trump Administration weigh down market stocks, which saw notable weakness in the previous session following news  from the President Trump  about ex-FBI chief. All these events could lead to major disruption to the market. Market attention is also focused on Eurozone data release next week, when  Italian and Eurozone growth figures for the first quarter will be released.  Experts hope to get a clearer picture of US President Donald Trump's direction on important policies that he has yet to specify.

		<title>Technicals vs. Fundamentals</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">To review the primary operating motive of this series of articles: there are hundreds of fundamental factors driving the precious metals markets (currency debasement, potential stock market declines, geopolitical instability, jewelry demand, and industrial fabrication being the major ones). However, no one can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ever</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> know the sum of all fundamental factors impacting a market. To attempt to do so would require complete knowledge of all the factors impacting of each and every single participant in the international market. Such is an impossibility.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the one place in which every market participant comes together – no matter what his or her specific fundamental belief – is in the decision to buy or sell at a specific price point. Price is where the sum of all market participants converge.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, by studying price foremost, we can observe what is actually happening in the market by filtering out the ‘noise’ that so often accompanies fundamental-only analysis. And by observing trends in price – the sum of the buyers and sellers – we can align ourselves with the strongest ones in an attempt to profit.</span>
<h3><strong>Silver Price Update</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us take a good look at silver this week. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver price</a> finished higher last week by $0.13 cents to close at $16.40 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon, a gain of 0.8%.  </span>On the very short-term, the RSI momentum indicator (top of chart), which had registered the most oversold reading since the 2015 bottom, correctly gave us a warning of this bounce that is underway.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1903 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Silver-most-oversold-since-2015-bottom-1024x767.png" alt="Silver-most oversold since 2015 bottom" width="555" height="416" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The question of how far this advance continues remains to be seen. We would like to see <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> regain its broken rising linear trendline (dashed blue), by maintaining a weekly close above $16.50. Such would register the recent break as a “false breakdown” at the most-oversold reading in nearly two years, which would solidify this low as an important medium-term bottom.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if $16.50 fails to be regained again over the next two weeks and silver tops out below the broken trendline, we will consider this a sign of caution. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A sign of caution does not mean we negate the entire thesis for a Q3 – Q4 breakout in the metals. It would suggest, however, that silver could continue to lag throughout the initial stages of gold’s advance, perhaps failing to exceed its 2016 high ($21.25 ) within the same immediate time as when <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> finally exceeds its relative $1,378 peak. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Support lines between $16.75 - $17.25 has been removed from the silver chart above from the version from several weeks ago because, after serving as an important magnet for prices on four successive junctures from last October through the previous week, the zone failed to hold during the most recent decline. For whatever reason, a new group of sellers have shown up and/or buyers did not appear within that range as we had observed them previously, and so we must adjust our perspective and outlook accordingly.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the positive side, because this level is no longer a support zone, it will also no longer be a resistance level as silver moves higher. Sellers should be largely absent within this region.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is little in the way of resistance until $17.75, which becomes our target on a recapturing of the broken blue trendline at $16.50. This was the pivot low from the April correction.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the long-run, we have targets much higher than $17.75. However, over the short run this should serve as short-term resistance. </span>Silver must at minimum consolidate above Important Support labeled at $15.75 to keep the bull market thesis intact during the remainder of 2017. A break below this level would signal a major red flag for gold and cause us to have to rework the 2017 – 2020 long-term model.
<h3><b>SLW / SLV Ratio</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We often use the ratio between large-cap silver miners and silver bullion itself to gauge short-term pivot points in the metals. Silver Wheaton (SLW) is our large-cap miner of choice, a sector leader across most timeframes. Below we update the chart, with SLW on top and SLV (silver bullion proxy) immediately below. Note that SLW now is firmly within the 2017 mid-consolidation (above the green support band), while silver itself is well below its correlated price zone. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, SLW often discounts short-term price movements that will not last in the underlying silver market.</span>
<p class="aligncenter"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1904 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SLW-well-above-March-lows.png" alt="SLW well above March lows" width="440" height="456" /></p>
<p class="aligncenter"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This leading indicator is calling for a continued recovery in silver over the intermediate-term, although please note that this signal can sometimes occur early, i.e. immediate weakness in silver can occur for the first few days, and then the recovery begins. Those looking to do short-term trading in silver should use other confirming technical indicators such as momentum and trendlines analysis.</span></p>

		<title>Daily Market Review - May, 15</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,236.00 (+0.34%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.79 (+1.13%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $940.20 (+1.06%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $814.15 (+0.32%), Dow Jones index 20968.90 (0.35% increase).</i></b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a new week after President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey and his administration offered differing rationales for the move. Now there is a significant expectations about even more staff shakeup. Our daily market review will bring you all needed news for making well-thought investment decisions during the next 5 days.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Dollar slipped on Monday, losing ground against so-called commodity currencies.The greenback also lost ground against other major currencies, including the euro. The dollar also suffered against the rising oil prices. Gold price rises up Monday as weaker-than-expected economic data and US Dollar start this week. Traders are expecting an almost 100 per cent probability of an interest rate increase in June, that could affect the yellow metal price. Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.  Among the other precious metals: Silver is up around 16.00 per ounce, platinum climbed over 1%, palladium also rose.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2401.61 (+0.45%) and NASDAQ Index 6144.91 (+0.38%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20968.90 (+0.35%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two key economic numbers –IIP and inflation – which were released last week are likely to have an influence on the domestic stock market this week. US data on Friday showed a smaller-than-expected 0.4% increase in April retail sales from the previous month, while a disappointing report on consumer prices raised concerns about the retail sector and the broader economy. </span>

<b>What to watch in the market in the week ahead?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, the economic calendar is almost barren, with only a few pieces of housing market data worth noting early on. The political schedule, as always, unpredictable, but markets have more or less moved on.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House focused on the potential staff shakeup after fired James Corney. The main concern to White House staffing changes continues to be what it always has been -- who are the replacements? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional geopolitical news: North Korea said on Monday it had successfully conducted a newly developed mid-to-long range missile test on Sunday, and pointed at verifying the capability to carry a "large scale heavy nuclear warhead." </span>

<b>Economic data for this week: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empire State Index (</span><b>Monday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Industrial production (</span><b>Tuesday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), </span><b>Wednesday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">-No major economic data, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekly jobless claims, Philly FED Index (</span><b>Thursday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Advance services report </span><b>(Friday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span>]]></content>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US dollar is tumbling on Tuesday morning, pressured by weak US data and the news that President Trump may have shared the sensitive information with Russians officials about Islamic State threat. Mr.Trump’s tweet reported on Tuesday morning: “As President, I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining....to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS &amp; terrorism.” weighed down the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies and added concerns to the US Dollar nearest forecast.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold price rose on Tuesday as the dollar became weaker and because of the slow economic activity in the United States recent reports. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors' expectations of a US rate increase in June fell to 74 per cent compared to 84 per cent last week and provide a great prospective for gold price in the short-term forecast. Among the other precious metals: silver is up over $16.00 per ounce, platinum and palladium prices also climbed today.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2404.28 (+0.08%) and NASDAQ Index 6157.57 (+0.13%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21007.75 (+0.12%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The main US Stock Market Indexes  started trading higher in early pre-market day. Data on housing starts for April and data on industrial production will be released today.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices traded higher and gained over 3% after Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to extend production cuts in 2018.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The market reaction to the latest news about shared sensitive intelligence obtained from a close meeting of President Trump with Russian foreign minister and an ambassador was muted. Analytics doubt this news just added lack of enthusiasm that the President will be able to deliver on plans to boost infrastructure spending and cut taxes.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar Index is being weighed down today by weak economic data and lack of optimism over higher American growth and inflation continuing to fade following a  round of disappointing housing data. Investors had the high hopes for Mr. Trump’s vision of America, but the latest scandal about shared information with Russian officials puts his plans on hold or may see them implemented at the worst. The New York Times yesterday reported James Comey took notes of a meeting where President Trump asked him to stop investigating into National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, who allegedly contacted with Russian officials during last year's election campaign.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> price opened higher on Wednesday, as the yellow metal benefited from the weaker Dollar.  The weaker than expected housing starts report and weaker than expected retail sales report last week have caused the higher gold prices. Among the other precious metals: <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver</a> is up over $17.00 per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> prices also climbed today, meanwhile, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">palladium</a> dropped down.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2400.67 (-1.31%) and NASDAQ Index 6169.87 (+0.33%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20979.75 (-0.01%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Concern that U.S.President Donald Trump's reform agenda could be slowed down, and that Trump himself could even face the threat of impeachment after being involved in Russian scandal, added to disappointing U.S. economic data on Wednesday  the lower main stock market indexes today. The main indexes were on track for their largest daily declines in nearly two months. Some investors still suggest that a market reaction seems muted to what’s going on in Washington, and has more focus on Washington’s ability to push tax reform.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices strengthened on Wednesday ahead of U.S. crude inventory data that could give investors a clue as to whether an OPEC-led output cut is making progress in reducing a persistent global supply overhang.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,253.50 (-0.59%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.63 (-1.36%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $935.00 (-0.95%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $764.00 (-2.05%), Dow Jones index 20620.07 (0.06% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. dollar index has moved to its daily high on Thursday and is trading slightly up ahead of midday. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> price opened lower this morning but still remains generally well bid in the wake of the yesterday’s solid gains and the 5-day rally. The precious yellow metal stays underpinned by haven demand amid ongoing political turmoil in the US. Among other precious metals: <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver</a> price slipped from multi-week highs today, declining below $17.00 per ounce; <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">palladium</a> prices are also down.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metals analysts see potential for more gold gains over the next weeks as the political turmoil continues in Washington D.C. and may perhaps reduce any monetary tightening by the Federal Open Market Committee. They characterized gold as a market which “needs a story” in order to keep rallying, and since right now there are suspicions that there will be more coming out of the White House, there might be a continued safe-haven bid for gold.</span>

<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks opened lower on Thursday due to concerns about the future of the President Donald Trump and his ability to deliver on his pro-growth agenda. However, over the trading day all three stock market indexes held higher, rebounding from the brutal selloff: S&P 500 2360.76 (+0.16%) and NASDAQ Index 6033.35 (+0.37%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20620.07 (+0.06%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although stocks recorded their biggest drop in eight months, some technical analysts examined them by numbers and affirmed that they don't see a major sell-off ahead. In fact, those stock market analysts expect a shallow pullback at best, even as stocks dropped yesterday on worries about whether the Trump administration will be able to push its pro-growth agenda through Congress.  Anyhow, there are signs that investors remain skeptical, and both caution and volatility may stay high with the existing political turmoil in Washington.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Dollar Index lost all its potential previous gains on Friday. The dollar got a small boost from better than expected reports on jobless claims and manufacturing index earlier. The U.S. dollar index hit a low of 97.481, its lowest since Nov. 9 this week. Gold prices corrected this week, because investors were buying gold as a refuge from the volatility and of course the weaker US dollar. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> price opened slightly lower on Friday, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> is up, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> prices also climbed today, meanwhile, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">palladium</a> dropped down a few points.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2381.56 (+0.67%) and NASDAQ Index 6095.98 (+0.67%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20748.86 (+0.41%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The main U.S. stock market indexes advanced on Friday, driven by political uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump’s presidency, but still, on the track for weekly loses. The market is looking to stabilize as no new political news hit this morning headlines, suggesting that investors are willing to play out the political turmoil without pushing the panic switch.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices are higher today, if we look at what's happened since the beginning of the year; market tried to trade the OPEC production cuts, the big draws in the U.S. inventories, and it got reduced once in April and again in May.</span>

		<title>US Dollar Breaks Down on Trump Investigation</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The big news across the currency markets this week was the large drop in the US dollar, which fell over 2% against a basket of currencies representing the US dollar index. The drop came on the heels of the announcement that the US government will launch a special investigation into alleged Russian connections with President Trump during last November’s election. While the investigation may take years to complete (and it could be a propaganda campaign by opposing political forces), the market has cast an initial vote by selling the US dollar in favor of other currencies, most notably the euro and yen.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our focus here is not to dwell on the world political scene, but to illustrate the market reaction to these events, and to show how the currency crosspairs may impact the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">precious metals prices</a>.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1936 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/US-Dollar-Index.png" alt="US Dollar Index" width="1023" height="608" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar has now negated all of the post-Trump rally, returning round-trip to the 97 level on the dollar index, a process which has taken six months.</span>

It is important to note that our analysis began to give hints that something negative was brewing for the dollar back in January, strictly based on interpretations of the chart. We observed lower lows forming in the dollar, and a failure to sustain a breakout to new highs in December, which came after a 9-year advance.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This failure of a market to move higher after an attempted breakout constitutes a “false breakout” in our technical model. When such a false move comes after a 9-year advance, it may signal exhaustion in a market, and a pending trend reversal in the opposite direction.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not until now, four months later, that the news has finally synched with the technical hints. This is almost always the case in technical-based market analysis: the move is observed first on the charts, and the news arrives some weeks or months later to explain the reasons why.</span>
<h3><b>Short-Term Technical Considerations</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The rising trendline from May 2016 has now clearly been broken to the downside (turquoise color, above). The retest failed a week prior (callout), and a continuation lower is now in process for the dollar.</span>

<b>Our initial target for the dollar is 95.5 on the index</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, highlighted above in green. This target is derived from measuring the amplitude of the failed move above the 99.5 former support level to the 103.5 peak (4.0), and subtracting this value below the breakdown point. The real-world interpretation of the target is that we expect an equal number of sellers to cut their losses below 99.5 as those who attempted to go long the dollar above this level. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a confirming target, 96 on the index is also the 50% mid-point of the prior consolidation, which ranged from 92 to just above 100. When we have two technical targets within 0.5 points of one another, it increases the probability of the range being hit.</span>
<h3><b>Dollar Intermediate-Term</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 95.5 level is an initial downside target only. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have made the case in past issues that the false breakout above 100, which consisted of the entirety of the previous six months of post-Trump action, more importantly constitutes a long-term reversal after a 9-year advance in the USD. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While some level of bounce is expected after the initial 95.5 target is hit, we anticipate further intermediate and long-term downside remains. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, this is a central component of the thesis for a precious metals bull market, as the strongest gains to come in years ahead should arive from a growing world-wide recognition that the world’s present “reserve currency” is a depreciating store of value.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After a bounce at 95.5, our secondary target will be 92 on the dollar index. This level is critically significant for the US currency, as we can see from the 15-year chart below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1937 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/US-Dollar-index-2003-now-1024x609.png" alt="US Dollar index 2003- now" width="840" height="500" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 92 secondary target represents important long-term horizontal support (double black lines), which can be observed from the multiple spikes lower toward that level in 2015 – 2016, and more significantly in the resistance zones which date back to 2004 – 2005 (far left). Further, just below this level, 91.2 represents the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the entire 2008 – 2017 advance (light grey lines).  Again, we have multple technical targets in this 91-92 region, and so the zone will take on important consideration.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The question that remains to be seen is: what sort of bounce will the market take between the initial target of 95.5 and the secondary target of 92? In an impulsive market decline, this sort of initial bounce may not last more than 1-3 months before sustained selling re-emerges.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of the exact legnth of the dollar bounce at 95.5</span><b> any price action that remains below 100.5 on the index will keep the technical criteria for a long-term top valid in the US currency.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A test of the 92 secondary target would thus be anticipated for Q3 – Q4 2017. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A break below 92 would be a strong confirming indicator of a new bear market materializing. Longer-term, we expect that the dollar will eventually make new all-time lows below 72, with the timing for this likely into the mid-years of the forthcoming decade.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar struggled to move ahead on Monday, holding near six-month lows against a basket of currencies as investors assessed the impact of US political turmoil and a resurgent euro. This week President Donald Trump on a trip to the Middle East, left behind political uncertainty in Washington that just adding some fear for the nearest US Dollar Index forecast. At the same time, gold price gained a few points on Monday, and political worries surrounding  U.S. President may keep supporting demand for the metal as a safe-haven asset. Among the other precious metals: silver is slightly higher today, platinum prices dropped down, palladium price lost over 1%.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2390.26 (+0.36%) and NASDAQ Index 6118.35 (+0.57%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20880.84 (+0.37%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street climbed at the open Monday, advanced by deals announced during Trump’s visit  to  Saudi Arabia and an unexpected executive turnover at Ford. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ford replaced CEO Mark Fields (who has worked at  Ford for 28 years) with Jim HAckett, the former CEO of Steelcase.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia has heralded billions of dollars of deal announcements, including from those with White House ties.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices will be in focus this week ahead of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting on Thursday.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar index was little changed on Tuesday morning. With a light economic schedule for today, the investors’ focus is still on the troubling political developments. Analytics considered that because of a huge drop down in British Pound following the terrorist attack in Manchester, US Dollar may gain some points, but nothing actually changed in the greenback. It seems that US Dollar cannot get out of its weak way. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metals prices are also relatively quiet, despite tragic news coming out of Manchester, England. Since last week gold price advanced 2.2% over Trump's alleged links to Russia and his firing of former Federal Bureau of Investigation Chief James Comey, which raised concerns about his ability to push through promised fiscal stimulus. Among other precious metals: <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> is slightly higher today, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">palladium</a> prices also rose.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2394.64 (+0.03%) and NASDAQ Index 6128.02 (-0.09%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20 907.73 (+0.07%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The main US stock market Indexes rose on Tuesday morning, European markets generally recovered from an early dip that followed Manchester news. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The President Trump administration is set to unveil its budget Tuesday. The new budget may cut hundreds of billions of dollars from programs such as Medicaid, food stamps, and disability insurance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Census Bureau will report new home sales data for April later today. Oil prices reversed early losses that followed news reports outlining a 10-year, $3.59 trillion packages of spending cuts charted by the White House. The plan reportedly proposed selling about half of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. </span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar was little changed against other major currencies on Wednesday, as investors awaited the results of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting later in the day. The greenback regained some ground as investors turned their attention to the upcoming minutes of the Fed’s meeting, with hopes of further indications on the pace of future rate hikes. The U.S. dollar has been weakened recently following a media buzz of revelations surrounding the FBI’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in November’s U.S. presidential election. Gold price lost some points on Wednesday, and investors expect gold prices to trade lower today after a recent rally. Among other precious metals: silver is slightly lower today, platinum and palladium prices also lost points.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2394.64 (+0.03%) and NASDAQ Index 6140.70 (+0.03%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20 972.30 (+0.16%).</span>

U.S. stocks traded slightly higher on Wednesday, though activity was subdued, ahead of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting, which could doubt about a June interest-rate increase.

White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney defended Tuesday the major cuts to social safety-net programs included in President Trump’s budget proposal, saying there’s still plenty of funding for people who truly need help.

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,268.30 (+0.83%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.30 (+1.21%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $970.30 (+1.64%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $782.80 (+1.46%), Dow Jones index 21,077.12 (0.03% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
The U.S. dollar was flat yesterday but rose on Friday against the other currencies as crude-oil prices fell following an agreement by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producers to extend production cuts. The greenback was supported by Thursday's better than expected U.S. initial jobless claims data. Gold price hit more than one-week high on Friday. Investors suggest gold will stay an alternative investment during this political and financial uncertainty. Among the other precious metals: silver is slightly higher today and on track to its biggest weekly rise since mid-April, platinum and palladium prices also gained points.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2415.55 (+0.02%) and NASDAQ Index 6208.89 (+0.04%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21 077.12 (-0.03%).</span>

U.S. stock markets will be closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day. Main market indexes flipped between small gains and losses today, as investors struggled to find fresh reasons to push shares to records ahead of a holiday weekend.

Price of bitcoin rebounded today after a small drop yesterday. Most major cryptocurrencies have been on an upwards trajectory in recent months, with bitcoin hitting new all-time highs in quick succession.

This week, on his first trip abroad, the U.S. President traveled to Saudi Arabia, Israel, Rome and Brussels. Now Donald Trump is attending G7 in Italy (Sicily). In Saudi Arabia, the President announced a $110 billion arms deal and signed deals “potentially” worth more than $200 billion over the next 10 years. Trump claimed that he signed historic agreements with the Kingdom that will invest almost $400 billion in these two countries and create many thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia.

		<title>Daily Market Review - May, 30</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,265.10 (-0.26%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.51 (+1.20%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $947.00 (-1.50%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $803.50 (+0.17%), Dow Jones index 21,032.02 (0.23% decrease).</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a new week after a long Memorial Day weekend. Global stock markets started weaker on Tuesday ahead of a busy week on the data front including consumer confidence and nonfarm payrolls numbers. There will be two important reports this week: consumer confidence figures on Tuesday and the May job report on Friday.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index futures are trading lower today after a long weekend and a small rebound last week. Traders are waiting for U.S. economic reports and consider that the dollar could get a more profound boost in upcoming economic data. However, some market analysts suggest that US Dollar still needs an extraordinary amount of monetary support. The precious metals have turned lower on Tuesday’s early ranges. Meanwhile, risk surrounding the upcoming  Britain’s election, the prospect of early elections in Italy and worries over Greek debt could support gold.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver gained a few points; platinum dropped down over 1%, palladium marked one of its late highest levels since April.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2411.79 (-0.17%) and NASDAQ Index 6205.35 (-0.08%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21 032.02 (-0.23%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks mostly edged lower from record levels on Tuesday, even the market’s uptrend was seen as remaining intact following the latest rally. Much of the market’s gain over the past several months has come on hopes that the Donald Trump administration would push through legislation on taxes and regulation that would boost corporate profits and accelerate growth. The analysts say that progress still need to justify current levels.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last recovery in stocks was also coincided with Trump’s first trip as president abroad, causing some to speculate that investor focus on the Russia probes may return when the president returns to U.S. soil.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the busy economic data will keep investors busy during this week.</span>

<b>Economic data for this week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: personal income, consumer spending, consumer confidence index </span><b>(Tuesday),</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pending home sales index </span><b>(Wednesday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Weekly jobless claim, ADP employment report </span><b>(Thursday),</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Unemployment rate, May job report </span><b>(Friday).</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span>

		<title><![CDATA[Gold & Silver Price Updates]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> closed higher by $14 or 1.2% to finish at $1,268 for the week. The precious metal is now close enough to its key long-term 2011-2017 downtrend that we can again call this advance another attempt to overcome the critical level. The last attempt to do so came on April 17 at $1,290 per ounce – a level which was exceeded for a few hours before failing to hold it throughout the overnight trading hours. As the trendline is downward sloping, the level to overcome inherently is falling every week, and we thus shift our focus to the $1,280 level, as shown below by the most recent arrow just above that long-term (magenta color) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trendline.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2004 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Gold-2008-Present-1024x766.png" alt="Gold 2008-Present" width="840" height="628" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have stated in the past that our target upon a successful breakout of the pennant-shaped consolidation will be $330 above or below the apex of the consolidation, which is $1,205: thus, either $1,535 or $875, within 6-12 months of the breaking point. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will have much more analysis on what short-term swings to expect </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">within</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this significant movement once the break of the pattern finally happens. For now, let us continue to focus on the pattern’s resolution itself, and the $1,280 figure that would be required at this juncture.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2005 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2011-2017-Downtrend-1-1024x766.png" alt="2011-2017 Downtrend" width="840" height="628" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most probable scenario we see is that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> again fails to break out this week, and continues to grind in the low-mid $1,200’s through Q3, in what should be the final exhaustive consolidation to wear out the last remnants of the “hot money” that became interested in the sector only after 2016’s first-half surge.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, at our firm we are already largely invested, and that is because in a bull market surprises should be expected to the upside, i.e. a breakout sooner – perhaps by mid-summer – rather than later in the year. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While in the midst of a lengthy consolidation it is difficult to imagine that anything else will ever occur. Frustration grows as the sector oscillates without much definitive movement. This is exactly the time to go against the herd and not succumb to such limited perspective.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The price action that occurs after a consolidation breaks will have little resemblance to the price action within the consolidation itself. This is one of the clearest consolidation patterns we have ever observed in the gold market. Let us remain alert.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The technical action in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> is encouraging for the entire sector. Gold’s cousin rose $0.53 cents or 3.1%, to close at $17.32 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday. Having regained the rising trendline successfully, we can now call the final portion of silver’s plunge into early May below $16.50 a “false breakdown” as can be seen on the chart.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2007 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Silver-oversold-1024x766.png" alt="Silver oversold" width="840" height="628" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is minor resistance at $17.75 which may halt the current advance – although if and when gold breaks its primary consolidation, silver should rise with strength such that it may simply ignore most of the previous short-term resistance levels that are visible on the chart above. On a successful gold breakout, momentum indicators and/or leading signals from the silver mining complex will be more important for gauging the next target of an intermediate high.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To the downside, we would see a break of support at $15.75 as a major red flag that the expected bull market advance may be delayed beyond 2018.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Longer-term, however, the clarity of silver’s basing pattern could not be more apparent. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver prices</a> are now beginning their fifth year below the $25/oz region. Downward momentum is largely exhausted after the 73% drop from 2011 – 2015. The longer that prices remain in this basing pattern, the stronger that the move higher will eventually be once $25 is breached. We must remember that at each swing higher and lower within a basing pattern, metal is being transferred from weak hands to strong.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our general expectation is that silver may continue with this basing process with an upward bias through mid-2018.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2008 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Silver-2011-2017-1-1024x925.png" alt="Silver 2011-2017" width="840" height="759" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar pushed higher against other major currencies on Thursday, supported by the release of U.S. jobs data and as investors are now expecting Friday’s highly anticipated nonfarm payrolls report. There is a lot of disappointment about the pace of reforms, tax cuts, regulation reductions in the U.S. and while the Fed can hike interest rates in June, they won't be able to increase interest rates again for the rest of this year. When thinking about the risks to dollar predictions over the coming year, a significant majority of strategists said it was skewed more to the downside. Gold edged lower on Thursday but held near the five-week highs hit in the previous session, as expectations that the US Federal Reserve will hike interest rates this month still weighed down on gold prices but geopolitical uncertainty provided some support. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Among other precious metals: silver fell 0.1%, platinum dropped down, palladium, which hit a four-week high, gained a few points.  </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened slightly higher S&amp;P 500 2416.97 (+0.21%) and NASDAQ Index 6223.96 (+0.41%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21 002.99(-0.03%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street opened higher on Thursday, but quickly turned mixed in a busy session stirred by late-season earnings news and a heavy economic calendar.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump is expected to announce his decision on Thursday on whether the United  States will continue to be part of the global pact to fight climate change. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices climbed 1.3% Thursday after data from the American Petroleum Institute had shown U.S. crude inventories fell last week. Investors are keeping a close eye on U.S. production after OPEC and other major producers decided to extend their production cut agreement last week for nine additional months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, investors are likely to hold off all moves until they will see  US jobs data today (ADP employment) and Friday (non-farm payrolls). </span>

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">weekly jobless claims, ADP employment report.</span>

		<title>Why is Bitcoin going up?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bitcoin</strong> is the hot topic recently after the Bitcoin price reached a historical high of over USD 2,700 on May 25th, marking an 180% year-on-year increase. Speculations are blooming around the subject. However, the certainty is that for those who made $10 investment in bitcoin in 2010, now they would have $7.5 million. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s review facts first and then talk about the reasons for Bitcoin behavior. </span>
<h3><b>Bitcoin ABC:</b></h3>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin founder - Satoshi Nakamoto.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximum supply of bitcoin is set at 21 million.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It does not pertain to any regulatory institution or country.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first transaction made with Bitcoin: May 22nd, 2010 - a programmer bought two pizzas worth 10,000 bitcoins.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2010 a bitcoin was worth 0.03 cent.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 25th, 2017, it is worth little over 2,700 dollars.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan passed recently a law that accepts Bitcoins as legal currency and payment method.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Why is Bitcoin going up?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Opinions are dispersed, but it is obvious there is no right answer, rather it seems a serious of favorable events caused the bitcoin price up, following the positive, ascending trend noticed for some time now (means, analysts expect bitcoin price continues to grow).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From most of the reviews, Japan is passing the law on accepting bitcoins as currency and payment method has been definitory in raising demand for bitcoins. Currently, more that 40% of bitcoin trade is done in Japan and Korea in Yeni. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some analysts explain that bitcoin price is all about supply and demand. Considering all political uncertainty in the US with Trump, in Europe with Brexit, in Asia with China and bad loans, bitcoin becomes sought out as a “safe haven”, which is not regulated by any country and is considered safe in such times of distress. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is possible that now we see a price bubble, result of economic turbulences and market reaction to events enumerated above, as there are the skeptics who expect bitcoin prices to drop even by 50% in the next period, meaning around USD 1,500, us witnessing the so-called “correction” in prices. On another hand, such event can even be perceived as a great time for investment in bitcoins. Either way, in the long run, the positive trend is expected to be kept. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if more states would follow Japan’ example on accepting bitcoins, this could make the cryptocurrency an even more attractive investment, and it would draw the ones who previously avoided it due to the high risk and price swings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If there were another major financial crisis, we would see bitcoin prices rising even higher, as these are one of the safest investments out there. Bitcoin now is somewhat regarded as “digital gold” by some investors. There are many similarities, they're both issued through a mining process (one real, the other simulated), they are both finite, and they are both seen as a store of value. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why if you’re like Bitcoin, chances are you may also want to diversify your portfolio with gold. However, turning Bitcoin into gold can be difficult, time-consuming and expensive. That’s why Bullion Exchanges offers a great variety of precious metals bullion and accept Bitcoin as a paying option. </span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - June,2</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,275.40 (+0.62%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.48 (+0.63%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $940.80 (+0.61%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $839.30 (+1.47%), Dow Jones index 21,144.18 (0.65% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar dropped after yesterday jobs report released. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the US economy added 138,000 nonfarm jobs in May, which was below economists' expectations of 182,000. Investors will be looking for further clues on the timing of rate rises in US non-farm payroll data due later in the day. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Gold prices slightly higher today, following a weaker than expected U.S. jobs report. Among the other precious metals: silver is slightly higher, platinum is also up, palladium has gained a few points and following its best weekly performance.  </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2430.06 (+0.76%) and NASDAQ Index 6246.83 (+0.78%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21 144.18(+0.65%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stock-market indexes hit intraday records in early Friday trade, though gains were limited after a weaker-than-expected May jobs report that undermined confidence in the economy. Despite the unexpectedly low print on the jobs report, expectations for a rate hike in June are still relevant.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, President Trump confirmed on Thursday afternoon. The widely anticipated decision comes in spite of a broad push from American companies, business leaders, politicians and even many in the president's inner circle to remain in. Hundreds of companies came out in support of the Paris climate agreement, sealed in December 2015. More than 300 businesses in November signed an open letter calling on Trump and Congress to stay in the pact, including Nike, General Mills, Tiffany &amp; Co, eBay, Gap, Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The big question now is how other countries will respond to Mr. Trump’s withdrawal. The US could face serious diplomatic repercussions for leaving. Europe, China, and other countries may decide to withhold cooperation on issues the Trump administration cares about, like a trade for example.</span>

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonfarm payroll, Unemployment rate, average hourly earnings. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a new week ahead with slipped market on Monday as investors tried to analyze potential market-moving events after a weekend's terror attack in the U.K. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terror incident comes just days ahead of the U.K. election on Thursday.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a busy week in Washington: President Trump will try to focus on Administration Infrastructure before the FBI former James Come’s highly anticipated testimony will be announced on Thursday. This week will also deliver the U.K. general election and a European Central Bank meeting. </span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar began this week slightly higher, giving the investors promise that it could gain some points during this important week ahead. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t is a holiday in parts of Europe ( Germany and Switzerland), so US Dollar today supported by close European markets.  Although excitement is not until Thursday's ECB meeting, UK election, and the testimony of former US FBI Director Comey. This week the European Central Bank (ECB) governing council will meet to fix monetary policy. Geopolitical risk is set to dominate US markets this week and may weigh down US Dollar again. Gold price rose at the beginning of the week and hit a six-week high supported by the disappointing U.S. jobs data on Friday. Among the other precious metals: silver is slightly changed, platinum price gained a few points, palladium also hit its strongest level in recent weeks.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2436.04 (-0.12%) and NASDAQ Index 6300.66 (-0.10%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21184.95 (-0.11%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks were slightly lower in early trading on Monday as oil prices fell after Arab states cut ties with Qatar over alleged support for Islamists and Iran, while markets mostly shrugged off the weekend attacks in London. Investors feared that the cutting of ties could hamper a global deal to reduce oil production. The attack in London on Saturday was the third in Britain in less than three months and came at a time when the country is heading for its general national election on Thursday.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The British snap election will be held on Thursday, June 8.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the US, fired FBI Director James Comey is set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday about his conversations with President Trump regarding suspicion of Russian interference in the 2016 election. His testimony is expected to drive further moves in equities and the dollar in a recurrence of market swings last month.</span>

		<title>The US Bond Market – the 800-Pound Gorilla</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The “800-pound gorilla” in the investment world is not the US stock market, nor yet the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> market – it is the US treasury bond market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US bond market, at over $40 trillion in value, is much larger than the US stock market, which comes in at a little over $25 trillion. The longest-dated component of the US treasury market is the 30-year bond.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The chart below shows the price of the US 30-year bond from 1980 through the present. Readers should recall that interest rates move inversely to price – so as the price has been rising steadily for the past 36 years, interest rates have been falling this entire time, to a generational low of 2.1% last summer.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2079 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/US-30-Year-Bond-Price-1024x609.png" alt="US 30-Year Bond Price" width="578" height="344" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we can see, investors have had an insatiable appetite for US debt over the past 36 years. We here see a market which was following a long-term orderly rising channel, which then started to take on characteristics of a mania from 2015 – 2016. During these recent years, bond prices began a parabolic curve higher (blue callout), corresponding to a willingness by investors to accept negative real returns for the privilege of holding US debt. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The textbook footprint of a mania on a chart is a long-term orderly market breaking higher into a parabolic curve. This is exactly what was witnessed from 2014 through mid-2016 in the longest-dated US bond.</span>
<h3><b>Parabolic Curve Broken</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The parabolic curve was then broken in last summer’s decline in bond prices, indicating a long-term top was put into place. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet bonds are once again in the media for having had several positive months in a row, as we can see below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2080 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Treasury-Bond-Price.png" alt="Treasury Bond Price" width="704" height="468" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If our analysis is correct, </span><b>any rally in bond prices from this point onward should be counter-trend in nature only</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Last summer’s highs at 175 should not be regained for bond prices. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will have strong confirmation within the next six months if bond prices make a new low below 145. Much stronger confirmation will come from a breakdown below the lower rising channel line (magenta color) near 135, which would be expected at any time within the next 12-36 months.</span>
<h3><b>Bond Market Critical to US &amp; Western Standard of Living</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The one backdrop which most investors alive today have known is rising bond prices and the corresponding falling interest rates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us assume that the average American begins to follow the financial markets and to consider investing at age 22. This means that anyone born after 1958 knows only falling interest rates as a broad macroeconomic backdrop.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every political and technological advance that has happened in the US and allied western nations since 1980 has occurred amidst falling interest rates and ever-cheaper credit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, total debt in the United States exceeded gross domestic product for the first time in 2011, a trend which does not appear to be improving:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2081 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FRED-1024x342.png" alt="FRED" width="840" height="281" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This imbalance can only happen amidst a backdrop of investors willing to ever finance US debt by continuously purchasing US-bonds. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet on the 36-year chart above, we show what appears to be the key characteristics of a market in the process of putting in a long-term top.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How will the United States finance this debt amidst a rising interest rate backdrop? The interest expense for federal debt alone in 2016 was $432 billion. Can we imagine if interest rates double just too historic norms that existed ten years ago? With the addition of record new debt this year, the annual interest rate expense alone could easily exceed $1 trillion within the next 3 years.</span>

<b>How will the United States fund an interest expense growing exponentially if the bond market has put in a long-term top?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, no politician wins re-election in a democracy by cutting funding to constituents.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No one stays in office for long by cutting benefits to the sick, the elderly, the poor, veterans, schools, or for infrastructure. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, the solution to the funding gap is: the Federal Reserve will be forced to print money.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The central bank will be forced to create sufficient money to “monetize” US bonds to cover whatever cannot be raised by taxes alone.</span>
<h3><b>Monetization of Debt is Inflation</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Monetization is the direct creation of new money to finance debt – and it will represent a hidden tax on those least able to afford it, namely the poor and middle-class on fixed incomes. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When inflation drives up the prices of necessities such as food and shelter, these classes have no means to protect themselves, as they are forced to buy those items no matter the cost. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, those with disposable income can protect themselves and even benefit from periods of inflation if they invest properly by owning real assets. For this reason, inflation is a regressive tax, in that it steals quality of life from the poor and gives to the rich.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the policy of most Western governments and central banks today.</span>
<h3><b>Back to the Bond Market</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, we come back to the bond market. The theoretical fundamentals of a declining bond market have been hypothesized by various writers for many decades… yet it is only now that we are seeing actual topping signals on the chart itself.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it possible that the parabolic curve seen on the chart above was simply a warmup for an even more manic final blow-off to come? Ultimately anything is possible in the markets. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But if that is going to happen, we will see it on the chart very soon, as bond prices should explode higher and clearly exceed the 175 level for 6-18 months before they come crashing down. Fundamentally, this could only correspond with real interest rates plunging into the negative 2-3% range, as investors would “pay” the government for the privilege of loaning money to them.</span>

<b>Our best assessment is that the top has already occurred. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A parabolic curve in the largest bond market in the world that exceeded the 36-year rising channel has already broken down. It would be rare to see this curve regained again.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> investors, this market bears our foremost attention over the next year. We should be able to plainly see a breakdown of the long-term rising channel on the chart when it occurs. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This will be a sign of a multi-decade top in no uncertain terms. Decades of rising interest rates should follow… and amidst a backdrop of a government caught between a rock (unfunded debt) and a hard place (printing money), we know that in the fiat era a government will always choose the later.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term thesis for protection by precious metals ownership is thus still in its infancy. </span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,292.00 (-0.27%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.71 (-0.33%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $952.40 (-1.17%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $839.65 (-2.07%), Dow Jones index 21,180.46 (0.21% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar Index rose against the euro due to reports that the European Central Bank was preparing to cut its inflation forecasts on Thursday. Nervous investors turned their attention into low-risk bonds and other safe-haven assets on worries linked to Britain’s general election, the European Central Bank’s policy meeting and highly awaited FBI Director James Comey’s testimony. Concerns about the situation have added to market doubts over the Trump administration's ability to deliver a promised boost to growth and recently weighed on the US dollar.  Gold price dropped on Wednesday, ahead of key political and economic events that are expected to stoke bullion's safe-haven appeal. Among the other precious metals: silver slightly decreased, the prices of platinum and palladium dropped off over 1%. All the key precious metals came under some pressure after the dollar gained points today.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2431.51 (+0.09%) and NASDAQ Index 6295.48 (+0.32%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21180.46 (+0.26%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes mixed today ahead of  “triple risk Thursday”, because of the Trio of important events: testimony on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election from former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, the U.K. general election, and a European Central Bank meeting. While stocks were trading close to their record highs this week, the risk is rising and the investors wait for tomorrow corrections. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are no high-impact data releases on the US calendar today, and tomorrow’s release of weekly jobless claims will likely to be in shadow due to the geopolitical events. UK and U.S. political uncertainty dominates sentiment.  </span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,284.80 (-0.28%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.73 (+0.33%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $950.50 (-0.03%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $856.80 (+2.48%), Dow Jones index 21,172.33 (0.01% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
U.S. Dollar Index futures are trading slightly better on “triple risk Thursday”. The US markets have been waiting for this day when three major risk events dominate investors’ attention.The European Central Bank will announce its rate decision offering guidance about the euro zone economic outlook going forward and former FBI Director James Comey will give a testimony to the U.S. Senate regarding his discussions with President Trump on dropping the investigation into the ex-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s alleged connections with Russia.

Gold price is little decreased this morning, while the silver and palladium prices are up, platinum also lost a few points.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2431.32 (-0.08%) and NASDAQ Index 6297.38 (+0.32%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21172.33 (-0.01%).</span>

Wall Street indexes were mixed on Thursday morning weighed down by the key events today. James Comey’s testimony could present a tremendous political risk to the market if he does release indeed some kind of a bombshell about the Trump presidency.Investors were worried that any further revelation about a probe into Russian interference with U.S. presidential election could dampen momentum for Trump's agenda of lower taxes. Meanwhile, investors also keep a close watch on European Central Bank's meeting in Estonia. European Central Bank announcements will show the euro's movement, that could affect U.S. Dollar changes.

UK election also takes place on Thursday. On UK election, the worst possible scenario to happen is Labor party secured the election. The Labor party victory means implementation of Corbyn’s tax-and-spend plans which will hurt UK corporate and create a rollercoaster on the global market.

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,267.60 (-1.07%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.31 (-1.03%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $944.00 (+0.02%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $870.70 (+0.98%), Dow Jones index 21,182.53 (0.04% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Dollar got a good boost early in the Friday session from shocking British election result that left no single party with a clear claim to power. The dollar is on course for its best day in over a month, while euro and sterling headed toward their first weekly fall since April. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The testimony of former U.S. FBI Director James Comey before the Senate Intelligence Committee also supported U.S. Dollar. James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director testified that President Trump and others in his administration lied when they said agents had lost confidence in Mr. Comey. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold lost ground with the raising  Dollar Index after the European Central Bank cut its forecast for inflation and said that policymakers had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying program. Among the other precious metals: silver price slightly decreased, platinum and palladium prices are up today.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2433.79 (+0.03%) and NASDAQ Index 6321.76 (+0.39%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21182.53(+0.04%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks rose on Friday, putting the main Wall Street indexes on a positive track as investors shook off a surprising U.K. election result and began to focus on the meeting next week of Federal Reserve.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday’s  British election ended in a hung parliament, meaning no party won the 326 seats needed to form a majority. International media reports announced Teresa May reached a deal with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party to help prop up the Conservative Party’s weaker position. This</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shock result throws British politics into chaos and could send Britain's negotiations to leave the European Union - start June 19.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Former FBI Director James Comey accused President Donald Trump on Thursday of firing him to try to undermine the agency's investigation of possible collusion by Trump's campaign with Russia's alleged efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s pretty much all news for this week. </span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,266.00 (-0.03%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.93 (-1.40%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $940.00 (+0.32%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $866.00 (+0.58%), Dow Jones index 21,219.61 (0.25% decrease).</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a new week ahead starting today with investors and traders eagerly anticipating the next Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting beginning on Tuesday. It’s expected that the Fed will hike the interest rate again but will also give a nod to the fact that inflation is weaker. However, its officials shall remain confident about the economy, giving reassurance that it’s still on track.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Dollar Index is weaker, easing back from a nine-day high hit at the end of the previous week. However, the greenback, just like the entire market, is awaiting the big focus of this week, the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, that will begin on Tuesday morning and end on Wednesday afternoon, during which the US interest rate is expected to slightly increase.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metals had a small bounce overnight as investors await the outcome of this June’s FOMC meeting. Gold and silver are relatively flat, after being slightly under pressure over last week, yet both of them are down with and 0.03% and, respectively, 1.40%. The lack of new bullish fundamental developments on the geopolitical front has limited the buying interest in these two favored safe-haven metals. On the other hand, both platinum and palladium prices are up today with 0.32% and 0.58%.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2,424.71(-0.29%) and NASDAQ Index 6,159.64 (-0.78%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21,219.61(-0.25%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">NASDAQ futures fell about 1 percent today as technology stocks resumed their downward movement from the previous session. The selective selling is a result of investors’ decision to put fresh funds to work in energy and financials. The rotation into these stock sectors started after the former FBI Director’s written testimony has been released last week, which pointed out that neither President Donald Trump was obstructing justice nor was he the target of the investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dow Jones and S&amp;P futures also fell on Monday, trading with 17 points and, respectively, 4 points lower as traders kept an eye on the latest European political elections. While the future of the U.K. government faced further uncertainty because of an inconclusive general election last week, President Emmanuel Macron's party showed signs of success in the parliamentary elections’ first round in France.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the main focus of the US Stock Market is on the upcoming meeting of the Federal Reserve which must announce on Wednesday whether it will raise its interest rates. Stock market volatility could pick up in the week ahead if the Fed will hike its target rate by a quarter point on Wednesday afternoon, as expected. The US central bank is not anticipating to sound too dovish, but it may also point out to a weaker inflation.</span>

		<title>Gold Fails at Technical Trendline</title>
		<content><![CDATA[The failed breakout and reversal back below the long-term declining trendline at $1,280 for gold this past week is a negative development for the entire precious metals complex. From a technical standpoint, it is exactly what we did not want to see as far as a market ready for a major advance.

Even so, we must quantify the nature of a false breakout. Those failed moves that happen at the end of multi-year or multi-decade advances (as we have recently seen in the US dollar) tend to be leading signals of long-term trend reversals. The <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold market</a> at $1,280 per ounce is nowhere near the all-time high from 2011 at $1,923. So inherently this failed advance cannot carry the same weight as a long-term top.

Still, the reversal could carry the consequence of a significant intermediate-term decline. By failing to sustain the advance above this same trendline once again, gold remains in a negative posture for the time being, until proven otherwise.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2116" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/a_gold-2011-2017-downtrend.png" alt="gold-2011-2017-downtrend" width="1099" height="823" />

&nbsp;

For the week as a sum, gold fell 0.9% or $12 to close at $1,266 as of the final trade in the electronic access market in New York on Friday afternoon.

Gold’s next initial support comes in at $1,230, which is the rising (dashed) trendline visible on the chart from the January low.
<h2><strong>Beware Early Celebrators</strong></h2>
We have been making the case over the last year that many technical-based traders would be waiting for this pending breakout signal to begin buying, as clear long-term trendlines are visible to many who follow such charts.

However, on Tuesday when we first saw the breakout attempt, we noted the necessity for the advance to <u>hold</u> the $1,280 level at least through this week’s Fed meeting on Wednesday. Also on Tuesday, we observed many premature celebrations throughout the investment world regarding gold’s breakout.

Long-term breakouts must have both conviction and sustaining power. From a contrarian standpoint, the lack of caution by so many investors, including mainstream media outlets such as Bloomberg and well-known commodity analysts, was a bearish setup for the sharp reversal seen the following day. Below are just a few samples:

<strong> </strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2117" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/b_gold-long-term-breakouts-yearly.png" alt="Long-term breakouts" width="942" height="791" />
<h2><strong>Gold’s Next Support</strong></h2>
The consolidation pattern continues to get tighter, and a big move is coming in one direction or the other. Gold could still find support above $1,230 and then stage a legitimate breakout in July or early August. But a failure at the $1,230 rising support would trigger a short-term topping formation, which would target $1,140 initially, and open the door to a retest of the 2015 bottom at $1,045.

We do not want to get too far ahead of ourselves at this juncture, except to say that gold remains in an inherently neutral consolidation following this false breakout. The bearish resolution would result in either a retest of the 2015 bottom at $1,045 or even a new low, while the bullish resolution would result in a significant leg higher across the entire <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com">precious metals</a> complex targeting $1,535 within 6-12 months. Fundamental drivers will be causing these moves, but we will be able to observe the signals on the charts before any attributable news is announced publicly.

It is not easy to stay involved at the beginning of a suspected bull market for a reason – whiplash is the term for the price action we are observing and the unease it causes investors.

Was the entirety of the gain in 2016 just a big false start, before <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> heads for a new low? We cannot know until the above pattern is resolved.

The bottom line is short-term risk has grown based on the this week’s failure. However, the book is not yet written.
<h2><strong>Fed Meeting On Tap</strong></h2>
This Wednesday is the Federal Reserve interest rate meeting, where the Fed is expected to raise rates for the fourth time since December 2015.

Expect lower volatility trading on Monday and Tuesday, with high volatility immediately after the meeting announcement at 2pm, especially if the markets are at all surprised by the Fed decision. For reference, the market is expecting a single rate hike, with language hinting of a further 0.25% hike to come either in July or September, so anything other than this outcome could cause a high-volatility reaction through the rest of the week.

Next week we will examine the Fed policy statement and the impact it has on the precious metals.

		<title>Daily Market Review - June, 13</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,259.30 (-0.49%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.74 (-1.15%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $928.00 (-1.38%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $859.00 (-1.72%), Dow Jones index 21,235.67(0.17 % decrease)</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Dollar Index is slightly weaker while gold and silver see a fifth-straight decline this Tuesday as investors are anticipating the next interest rates hike which is typically negative for these precious metals. Both are down with and 0.49% and, respectively, 1.15%. Platinum and palladium prices also decreased with 1.38% and 1.72%.</span>  

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This Tuesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) begins the first of its two-day meeting, with its latest Producer Price Indices to be released today and the interest rate decision due out tomorrow. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise the interest rates with another quarter point, and it’s also expected that it shall disclose more details on how it plans to reduce the mountain of Treasury and mortgage securities it currently holds.</span>

<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks this Tuesday: S&amp;P 500 2,429.39(-0.10%) and NASDAQ Index 6,175.46 (-0.52%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21,235.67(-0.17%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As technology stocks looked to bounce back this Tuesday morning, NASDAQ, Dow Jones, and S&amp;P futures opened higher but are still facing a downwards movement throughout these early hours. The analysts say that the ugly sell-off in tech names, like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google, is not necessarily an indication that the broader market is about to crack, yet there could be a possible summer swoon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The continued uncertainty about how quickly Donald Trump’s administration will implement its proposed policies also has a major impact on traders’ decisions. However, the entire stock market is primed for an increased interest rate and more details about how the Fed will begin the long process of shrinking its balance sheet.</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - June, 14</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,276.30 (+0.81%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.18 (+2.20%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $942.00 (+2.17%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $864.00 (-0.46%), Dow Jones index 21,331.93(+0.02 % increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This Wednesday morning, the U.S. Dollar Index fell to its lowest since November 9, after the release of a weaker-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index and Retail Sales data. On the other hand, gold prices slightly spiked in early trading Wednesday, on the back of FOMC’s news on CPI while still wobbling ahead of the meeting’s conclusion. The weaker-than-expected retail sale report for May is also working in favor of the precious metals market bulls, moving silver and platinum prices up with 2.20% and 2.17%. Palladium price slightly decreased with 0.46%.</span>  

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This unexpected decline in CPI and retail sales suggests that inflation pressures are moderating, which could lead to further interest rate increase. By the end of its two-day meeting this Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to raise U.S. interest rates with a quarter point. If the Fed raises rates, it will be the second of three expected hikes this year. The precious metals market is also keen to see if the Federal Reserve will act further and reduce its big balance sheet of government securities.</span>

<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks this Wednesday: S&amp;P 500 2,437.61(-0.11%) and NASDAQ Index 6,222.66 (+0.04%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21,331.93(+0.02%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stock markets closed at new highs on Tuesday following a rebound in technology stocks. Yet, traders are still digesting the latest round of retail sales and inflation data, so NASDAQ, Dow Jones, and S&P futures show slightly movements on this Wednesday morning.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders will be looking ahead to the second day of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting, in which it is widely anticipated to raise interest rates and establish its plans for the U.S. balance sheet, both announced at 2 p.m. E.T. However, the recent slowdown in inflation became a red flag for the stock market, which doubts the Federal Reserve’s ability to hike the interest rates a second time before the end of the year.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the wake of the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting that saw another interest rate increase, the U.S. dollar index is solidly higher while gold and silver prices are lower with 0.56% and 0.95%, hitting a three-week low in early trading Thursday. Investors are also bearish for other precious metals today, as the platinum price is down with 1.39% while palladium showed no price movements.</span>  

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve announced that it will proceed with interest rate hikes despite the softish inflation data and laid out a plan to begin the fairly aggressive reduction of its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. It also maintained its interest rate forecast, predicting that there will be another hike for this year. The Fed Chair Janet Yellen sounded more hawkish on inflation, although the FOMC statement showed that US inflationary pressures have eased a bit recently. As a result, the marketplace deemed this latest FOMC meeting as more hawkish on US monetary policy.</span>

<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks this Thursday: S&amp;P 500 2,437.92(-0.10%) and NASDAQ Index 6,194.89 (-0.41%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21,374.56(+0.22%).
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stock markets opened lower this morning, as traders reacted to the Fed’s latest policy decision, while technology stocks, including Facebook, Apple, and Amazon, slumped for the 2nd time this week. Dow Jones rose with 0.22%, while S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ declined 0.10% and 0.41%, respectively.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As it was widely anticipated, the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by 0.25%, however, its weaker-than-expected inflation numbers prompted worry among traders and investors. On the other hand, tech stocks are going downwards and throw more uncertainty in the marketplace after the Washington Post reported that special counsel Robert Mueller is currently investigating whether President Donald Trump attempted to obstruct justice.</span>

&nbsp;

<b><i>Here is a new week ahead when </i></b><b><i>Investors might get a break from the staggering news cycle that has dominated in June. There's only a smattering economic data on the calendar, with the one big piece of market news likely to come from banks.</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar is steady against a basket of currencies on Monday after slipping on soft US economic data, with investors awaiting comments by a top Federal Reserve official for clues on whether recent strength can be sustained. The US index climbed to a two-week high late the previous week after the Fed raised interest rates and kept the door open for another hike in 2017. But its rally was weighed down a little by Friday's weaker-than-expected housing and consumer sentiment data.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices are down and hit a four-week low in early U.S. trading Monday. Among the other precious metals: spot silver price was headed for its biggest weekly decline in six weeks, platinum price decreased and palladium also lost points on Monday.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2445.46 (+0.51%) and NASDAQ Index 6214.48 (+0.99%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21462.91(+0.37%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The main US stock indexes rose on Monday morning, suggesting a positive start to the week, split market over the last several sessions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Fed raised rates last week, weaker economic data has cast doubts over the central bank's ability to pursue an aggressive monetary policy for the rest of the year. </span>

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fed speakers (</span><b>Monday-Tuesday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Existing Home Sales (</span><b>Wednesday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Jobless Claims (</span><b>Thursday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), New Home Sales (</span><b>Friday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span>]]></content>

		<title>Fed Rate Hike and Gold</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve increased short-term interest rates on Wednesday by 0.25%, the fourth rate hike of the current cycle which began in December 2015. Short-term rates now stand at 1.00% - 1.25%, which are still generally - low levels, yet now a full point higher than they were 18-months ago.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The key from the Fed meeting on Wednesday was not simply the interest rate decision, but the language given in the accompanying statement regarding a potential reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet: “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Committee currently expects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated. This program… would gradually reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings by decreasing reinvestment of principal payments from those securities.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall that an expansion of the balance sheet is a euphemism for printing money, which is inflation. Thus, a normalization would imply a reduction in the money supply and a reduction in inflation.</span>
<h3><b>Will the Fed Normalize?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are extremely skeptical that the Fed will engage in any meaningful reduction in its balance sheet, mostly due to the central bank’s horrible record in doing so at any point in the past. Below is the Fed’s balance sheet over the last 15 years. Indeed, it is rare that the bank stops printing money for more than a few quarters at a time, its balance sheet having grown by nearly 500% during this time: </span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2138 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FRED-1-1024x394.png" alt="All Federal Reserve Banks" width="840" height="323" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking forward, a survey of Fed board members is now pricing in either 0-1 additional rate hikes in 2017, followed by 3-4 hikes in 2018, followed by 2 further hikes in 2019, as shown in the graph below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2139 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FOMC-Member-Forecasts.png" alt="FED Member Forecasts" width="505" height="353" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold price</a> fell sharply following the Fed meeting, giving up $20 on Wednesday afternoon, not so much because of the rate increase, but because of the language regarding balance sheet normalization.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether or not the Federal Reserve will actually reduce its balance sheet, the market believes that it will, and over the short run, this is seen as gold-negative.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the week in sum, gold ended lower by $15 or 1.2% to close at $1,254 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Viewed in isolation, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> remains in its neutral consolidation pattern. Short-term support should exist at $1,230 (rising dashed trendline), and the nature of any rebound that occurs at this level will tell us much about what to expect over the remainder of the year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The more critical 2015 – 2017 support (blue line) – which is rising every week – now comes in at $1,160.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2140 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2011-2017-Downtrend-1024x767.png" alt="2011-2017 Downtrend" width="557" height="417" />
<h3><b>Gold Has Formed Higher Lows on Successive Rate Hikes</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast to the theory often purported in the mainstream media that rising interest rates are negative for gold, the precious metal has formed a series of higher lows within one week of each of the Fed rate hike announcements, shown below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2141 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Gold.png" alt="Gold " width="1145" height="499" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Will last week’s announcement thus mark a fourth higher low forming in gold again? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Time will tell.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Dollar index is steady on Tuesday near 97. However, this support level is weak so investors should prepare for more downside activity. The US Dollar lost strength last week after the Fed’s two-day interest rate meeting. Weaker-than-expected economic data included retail sales, the consumer price index, and the producer price index also weighed down US Dollar. On the other hand, the yesterday speech from New York Fed President, William Dudley helped the US dollar to maintain its gains. The market is looking forward to New York Fed speeches this week. Gold price lost a few points on Tuesday, among the other precious metals silver and platinum prices are lower today, palladium price rose a little.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The main U.S. stock market indexes pulled back slightly on Tuesday, pressured by falling energy shares following a sharp drop lower oil prices.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said that low-interest rates do pose financial stability concerns that central bankers and the private sector must take seriously.

A speech by House Speaker Paul Ryan on tax reform later Tuesday is expected to be in the limelight as well.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,244.80 (+0.04%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.49 (-0.18%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $926.00 (-0.55%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $885.20 (+0.68%), Dow Jones index 21,468.31 (0.01% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar is a little bit weaker on Wednesday than yesterday's closing. However, the greenback rose higher earlier this week following comments from New York Fed President who said the further improvement in the US labor market would kindle inflation, which has shown signs of flagging in recent months. Gold inched up on Wednesday after hitting its lowest in five weeks in the previous sessions, buoyed as equities fell and the US dollar eased from one-month highs following a tumble in crude oil prices. Also, the possibility of another interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve this year is underpinning the bearish outlook for the yellow metal. Among the other precious metals: silver lost a few points, platinum slightly slipped today, while palladium is up.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2438.65 (+0.07%) and NASDAQ Index 6206.01 (+0.31%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21468.31(+0.01%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks started mixed on Wednesday as investors focused on volatile oil prices, which stabilized after dropping to lowest levels in more than seven months. Crude prices tumbled more than 2 percent, sending energy stocks lower on Tuesday on signs of rising oil production. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors also keep an eye on Washington as they digested remarks from House Speaker Paul Ryan on tax reform. He said the government is cutting back on regulatory red tape and that changes to the tax code must be permanent.</span>

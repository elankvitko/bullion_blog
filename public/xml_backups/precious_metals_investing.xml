<a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/123.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-50 alignright" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/123-300x225.jpg" alt="123" width="300" height="225" /></a>The United States has been making money since 1972, the first form of money being coins! These early coins were composed of precious metals and had actual value which led many individuals to begin collecting them. But does that mean everyone should just suddenly
jump into gold and silver? No, it does not. Precious metals are not for everyone. Just like any other investing, it is absolutely crucial that you obtain substantial knowledge of the products, as well as, the highlights and pitfalls prior to beginning a collection. So, let's get you started!

<strong>The 3 Most Frequently Asked Questions About Precious Metals:</strong>

<strong>What is U.S. 90 % silver coin and why is it highly recommended? </strong>

90% silver coins include quarters, dimes, and half-dollars minted before 1965. A face value dollar is how 90% silver coins are sold, meaning despite its composition 4 quarters for example minted before 1965 would equal $1 face value. A face value dollar is either 10 dimes, four quarters, or two half-dollars. A face value dollar contains .715 ounces of silver. 90% silver coins are highly recommended simply because it is often the cheapest, most divisible, most widely recognized and traded form or silver.

<strong>What is a round?</strong>

Silver rounds are composed of one troy ounce of .999 fine silver, the 99.9% pure silver coins are produced by various private refineries and are not just round "blanks" of silver. Silver rounds are made with varying designs, at times depicting highly trade-able coins. Regardless of the picture on their front and back, silver rounds do not have monetary value.

<strong>What is a Key Date Coin ? </strong>

In coin collecting, a key date refers to a date (or date and mint mark combination) of a given coin series or set that is harder to obtain than other dates in the series. This is because low mintage coins were frequently kept by collectors and saw little or no circulation, while common dates were rarely saved and typically became heavily worn. The next level of difficult to obtain coins in a series are often referred to as semi-key dates or simply semi-keys. Often times key date coins will be certified by top grading companies, including but not limited to NGC &amp; PCGS.

<strong>Bullion Fun Facts:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Several women have appeared on U.S. coins. The very first woman was actually not an American, she was a Spanish Queens. Featured on a commemorative coin, Queens Isabella of Spain was the first lady to be case on a W.S. coin in 1893.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>1964 was the last year the United States Minted quarters with 90% silver.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>In 1964 you could purchase a gallon of gas for 25 cents, today that same silver quarter is worth about $3.00!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>A 1964 silver quarter will still buy you a gallon of gas for your car! But, a 1965 quarter well that will only get you a shiny GUMBALL!</li>
</ul>
<em><strong>We have some pre 1964 quarters, do you?</strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Story of Philadelphia Coin Dealer Israel Switt</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Augustus Saint-Gauden is revered as one the most influential artists of his time, he was one the  first chosen in 1904 for membership to the American Academy of Arts and Letters,  and was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1896.

Saint-Gauden referred to his early relief portraits as "medallions" and took a great interest in the art of the coin.  Chosen by President Roosevelt to redesign the coinage at the beginning of the 20th century, he designed the double eagle coin which features a flying eagle on the reverse side and Augustus Saint-Gaudens' depiction of Lady Liberty on the obverse side. It was adapted for minting several times, but is still considered one of the most beautiful American coins ever issued.

Although 445,500 specimens of the Saint-Gaudens double eagle were minted in 1933, none were ever officially circulated because President Franklin Roosevelt decided to abandon the gold standard.  All of the coins were melted down, with the exception of 10 which disappeared from the Philadelphia Mint.

The family of Philadelphia coin dealer Israel Switt was granted the rights to 10 rare gold coins after a long battle which commenced when Switt's daughter gave the coins to the Philadelphia Mint to be inspected only to have the coins seized by the government.  In response to the seizure the Switt family filed a lawsuit against the government in 2011, claiming that it had previously split the proceeds with another owner in 2002 setting a precedent. They lost the lawsuit, however the U.S. appeals court overturned the verdict on Friday, April 17, 2015.

The U.S. Department of Treasury argued that the eagles were stolen from the U.S. Mint , and made claims that Switt was investigated in the 1930's , however their claims were quickly  invalidated with opposing attorney claiming he may have traded scrap gold for them. Since the verdict overturn they have not released any comments.

The family attorney Barry Berke said: “Congress clearly intended for there to be limits on the government's ability to seek forfeiture of citizens' property, and today's ruling reaffirms that those limits are real and won't be excused when the government violates them".

Keep your coins, the story they tell may make history some day!

		<title>Where To Store Your Bullion</title>

The term portfolio refers to any collection of financial assets such as bullion. <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/vault.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-108 alignright" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/vault-300x237.jpg" alt="vault" width="300" height="237" /></a>Portfolios may be held by individual investors and/or managed by financial professionals, hedge funds, banks and other financial institutions. In terms of storing your Bullion properly there are three options which will ensure the protection of your collection/investment. Each presents different advantages and disadvantages, which is why it is imperative to consider each option and decide which if not all will be beneficial to your needs.

<strong>Common Practices in Storing Your Bullion Properly</strong>

<strong><u>At Home </u></strong>

Storing your bullion at your home ensures constant accessibility and control over your valuables, however it is crucial to keep your bars and coins in secure fireproof area in the event of a fire or natural disaster. It is also wise to store your Bullion in a location that is not accessible to others, which will provide additional security against theft. If you choose to store your Bullion at your home, consider increasing your insurance. This option not only allows you to dictate where and how your bullion is stored, it also eliminates the fees and policies of third party providers.

<strong><u>In a Safe Deposit Box</u></strong>

This method for storing your Bullion certainly ensures security, and is an affordable option. The disadvantage is that your access is limited to the financial institutions hours of operation, and there are fees which are subject to change.  Prior to choosing this option, you must confirm the insurance policy provided for your bullion in the event of natural disaster or fire.

<strong><u>In a Depository</u></strong>

Another option for storing your Bullion is a depository, it is the most secure option. Depositories will fully ensure your Bullion, in addition to offering services in the event you need access to your valuables outside of their business hours. Though this option can be costly, if chosen it is vital to store your valuables separate and not in a pool to further protect your Bullion against unexpected closures and natural disasters.

There are alternatives, however avoid non-secure locations such as self-storage facilities. Safeguard the value of your wealth by securing your valuables in a dry, cool, fireproof, and most importantly discrete location.

		<title>Graded vs Ungraded , Which Do You Prefer?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/graded-vs-undgraded-00000005.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-172" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/graded-vs-undgraded-00000005.jpg" alt="graded vs undgraded (00000005)" width="850" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you own a coin that you genuinely believe is of substantial value, then it is worth taking
the time and money to have it certified, especially if you are interested in selling it in the future and want to realise its full potential.</p>
In the past, coin grading was a vague process and coins were categorized as good, fine, or uncirculated. As time went on, it became evident that a clearly defined and internationally accepted grading system needed to be established.

Coin grading has evolved over the years to a system of finer grade distinctions. Today, a coin is graded and given its market value based on its appearance and overall condition, there are five critical components that help determine this.
<ol>
 	<li>The Surface Preservation: This refers to the number of marks and scratches on the surface and the severity of these, in addition to the overall condition of the coin.</li>
 	<li>Strike: This is the process of imprinting a design onto a blank coin, more specifically the strength of the imprint.</li>
 	<li>Coloration: This can be described as a gage in how much the coin has changed from its original color. Discoloration may be due to age, improper cleaning, storage, or handling of the coin.</li>
 	<li>Luster: This refers to the appearance of a coin’s surface. It can be described as either satiny, proof like, or frosty. When you grade the luster of a coin, you basically grade the intensity, beauty, and integrity of the coin’s ability to reflect light, within the luster characteristics of that issue.</li>
 	<li>Eye appeal: This incorporates all of the above elements</li>
</ol>
Rarity is a significant factor in coin grading and in determining a coins value, there are several scales which have been developed for the definition of the rarity of a particular coin with the most common being “Sheldon Rarity Scale” and the “Universal Rarity Scale”.

When a coin is graded it is given a numerical value between 1 and 70. A PO-1 represents a barely identifiable coin and a MS/PR-70 represents a perfect coin with a full strike and no markings (these are incredibly rare). PO stands for basal (poor) state and MS stands for mint state. Between these opposite grades, in ascending order you get:
<ul>
 	<li>Fair (Fair): This is where you can identify the type of coin, although it might be bent or have holes.</li>
 	<li>Almost Good (AG): The design is outlined, parts of the legend are worn and smooth and the date is difficult to make out</li>
 	<li>Good (G): These are coins which are quite worn but have a distinguishable date. Design, legends and date are clear, but not sharp.</li>
 	<li>Very Good (VG): A coin showing extensive wear but for which the date and most lettering are still legible and devices are visible. (Devices can be defined as a design that is found on any coin. It is usually the bust of an individual who is a country symbol at a specific point in history. It might also be a country’s insignia.)</li>
 	<li>Fine (F): Moderate to heavy wear, entire design, legend and date are clear and bold, but it might still lack details</li>
 	<li>Very Fine (VF): Light to medium wear, the coins are slightly worn on the edges but sharp in details and an almost mint luster still evident.</li>
 	<li>Extremely Fine (XF or EF): used to describe coins which have been slightly circulated with light wear only on the highest points.</li>
 	<li>Almost Uncirculated (AU) Very small trace of wear only on the highest points. Very hard to tell the different between an AU and an Unc. Coins.</li>
</ul>
A grading finalizer assigns the final grade of the coin and thereafter the coin is sonically sealed in a protective, inert plastic holder known as a “slab”. This third-party appraisal of a coin’s physical condition, back by a guarantee, and a national network of reputable coin dealers provided an extremely reliable form of protection for rare coin consumers who could then participate in the coin market with greater confidence.

It’s imperative that you choose a reputable coin grading service to evaluate your coins and presently the NGC (Numismatic Guaranty Corporation) and PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service) form the top tier of a three tier grading service. They are the two most reliable and consistent services and use a consensus method of grading.  A <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/how-to/ngc-pcgs-graded-coins">NGC or PCGS coin grading</a> and approval have a higher demand in the market.

Although ungraded coins are undoubtedly cheaper and do not take on expenses beyond its cost, they are a hugely risky investment and as is pointed out, the true value of a coin lies in having it graded correctly, by an established and knowledgeable coin grading service.]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gold-21.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-242" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gold-21.jpg" alt="gold-21" width="800" height="305" /></a>

Gold steadied on Wednesday as the dollar mollified, yet was still trading near an almost
five-and-a-half-year low hit a week ago as analysts and investors anticipated the result of a Federal Reserve meeting for signs on the timing of the first U.S. rate ascend in about 10 years.

Policymakers are prone to assert that only steady indications of a  solid U.S. economy and labor market would put them on track to bring interest rates up in advancing months, analysts said.

For non-interest yielding gold, higher interest rates mean costs could feel obligated.

Robin Bhar, Societe Generale analyst says “We bounced from the low but we are little changed and waiting for the Fed’s statement tonight and the second-quarter gross domestic product tomorrow”.

“These are two events that should set direction for the next few weeks although the market is expecting no change in the Fed’s language.”

The metal reached $1,077 a week ago, it’s weakest since February 2010, after a sell-off on trades in New York and Shanghai, when analysts and investors cut their vulnerability on apprehensions of further value decays.

In the wake of breaking the $1,100 bolster level, gold has found it difficult to recoup and keep afloat showing bearish financial specialists kept on hovering in the market.

The dollar declined yesterday and was at 0.2% against a basket dominant currencies ahead of the policy statement due this evening.

Commerzbank states “If a rate hike in September were to be signaled, this would doubtless drive up the U.S. dollar, which would ultimately weigh on the gold price, for the Fed Fund Features have so far only priced in roughly 40% of a rate hike in September”.

European equities progressed, impelled by additions in the U.S. and Asian markets on trusts that Beijing could stem the defeat in its markets without harm to the world’s second greatest economy.

Worldwide gold interest shrank to its most minimal since 2009 in the second quarter as China emptied trusts into its now pained equities market, as per a report by GFMS, a division of Thomson Reuters.

Possessions of the biggest gold-backed exchange-traded-fund, New York’s SPDR Gold Trust, were unaltered at 21.87 million ounces on Monday, the least since September 2008, after a seven-day slide.

Spot platinum increased 0.6% to $622.75/oz and platinum advanced 0.1% to $982.50/oz, both not a long way above multi-year lows while silver remained unaltered.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Gold Tests Important Trend &amp; Dow / Gold Ratio Update</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/10/04/important-trend-dow-gold-ratio-update/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since the December 2015 bottom in precious metals, gold has risen $272 or 26% from the low of $1,045 per ounce, to close at $1,317 last Friday. From a technical observation, gold is now directly meeting with its rising linear trendline from the absolute lows (shown in blue). This line acted as support to mark the end of the correction in early June. Of course, the line simply represents big buyers who have been showing up in the gold market at increasingly higher levels over the last six months -- and we now want to see if they will show up again this week, just above $1,300.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-783" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_Gold-price-2015-2016.png" alt="gold-price-2015-2016" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

It will be an important test for gold. If the trend channel from the lows is going to hold, it will exert itself within the next 2-3 days, and the price should fail to close below the line for more than one day. This would then set up gold to attempt to break its long-term downtrend (magenta color) by mid-October.

Should the trendline fail -- it will constitute a technical breakdown in the short-term, but all hope will not be lost for the intermediate outlook . The support zone in the region of $1,306 -- which extends down to $1,285 and is shown in green -- has held <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> higher on four separate occasions over the last three months, and it is expected to continue to do so should the linear trend no longer remain in tact.

As investors in the volatile metals, we must expect the prices to move in a series of surges, consolidations, and corrections over the course of the next several years.

Nearing the bottom of the most recent trading range, the mood in the precious metals community has turned decidedly negative in the short-run, despite what has been less than a 5% correction in the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> since late-June. Recent headlines from Bloomberg this week include "Bulls Feeling Frayed as Gold's First-Half Run Fades Into History" and "Gold-Mining Investors hit by the Hitters as Share Rally Sputters".

It is said that corrections can manifest either in price or in time -- and in this case it is clearly happening in the later. Yet no matter which form they take, both price and time corrections serve to set the stage for the next round of advances as weak hands get flushed out of the market and new investors arrive.

When viewing mainstream articles that focus mostly on sentiment, it is helpful to remember that sentiment must necessarily be worst in the terminal stages of a correction, as quotes and headlines come from those who have already sold. And when a critical majority has sold, this is when a bottom in price is imminent.
<h2>Dow / Gold Ratio Update</h2>
The <strong>Dow to Gold ratio</strong> provides an excellent way to view the long-term real value potential for gold relative to the broad US stock market.

As discussed in past articles, the ratio has approached a 1:1 reading twice prior in the last century at precious metals peaks: in 1932 when the Dow crashed to the low 40's and gold was revalued from $20 to $35 per ounce, and again in 1980 when the Dow sat at 850 and gold exceeded $850 per ounce.

We expect that the ratio will hit 1:1 again before this cycle is completed in favor of precious metals.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-784" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/b_Dow-Gold-ratio-long-term.png" alt="dow-gold-ratio-long-term" width="1340" height="737" />

&nbsp;

Updating the analysis, with the Dow at 18,308 as of Friday, September 30 and gold at $1,314 per ounce, the ratio stands at 13.9 : 1. The 1:1 target could thus occur with stocks staying flat and gold approaching $18,000 per ounce, or the Dow falling to 2,500 and gold rising to meet it at $2,500 per ounce. Either way, the result should be over a 90% loss in value in real terms for US stocks before the next precious metals peak occurs.

Although such gains for gold or drops in the Dow may seem extreme given current prices, imagine that the same must have been felt with gold at $35 per ounce and the Dow at 900 in 1968. Yet the two did meet 12 years later.

Presently, the Dow / Gold ratio is in the later stages of a counter-cyclical uptrend, shown by the blue line above, amidst the generational downtrend shown in magenta.

Zooming in above on the counter-cyclical uptrend in favor of stocks since 2011, we see that the advance in the ratio has been halted by the declining long-term downtrend, and is now forming an ugly topping pattern, seen as a bearish-slanted head &amp; shoulders formation in the Dow / Gold Ratio:

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-785" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/c_Dow-Gold-ratio-2012-2016.png" alt="dow-gold-ratio-2012-2016" width="1240" height="737" />

&nbsp;

Once the support of the right shoulder is breached, the intermediate downward target for the pattern is measured at 9.0 on the Dow / Gold ratio, which should correspond to either the loss in value in stocks or the surge in price in gold -- both of which will cause increased attention toward precious metals amongst mainstream investors.

		<title>Gold Predicts Advance in the US Dollar</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/10/17/gold-predicts-advance-us-dollar/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The big driver impacting the precious metals market this past week has been the US dollar. We have been watching this converging wedge formation in the dollar index, a measure of the US dollar versus a basket of foreign currencies, for several months, and this past week the formation broke higher in favor of the dollar (see red highlight circle in the chart below).

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-801" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_gold-price-USD.png" alt="gold-price-usd" width="1240" height="737" />

&nbsp;

As we know, over the short run <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold tends</a> to move inversely to the US dollar.

Interestingly, gold had broken below its $1,305 consolidation support <em>a week before</em> the dollar broke higher from the pattern above. Gold, essentially, anticipated the strengthening of the US dollar prior to it actually occurring.

We can see the inverse correlation between the dollar and gold on the chart below clearly over the last 3 weeks.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-802" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/b_USD-Gold-correlation-october.png" alt="usd-gold-correlation-october" width="838" height="559" />

&nbsp;

Now since October 6, gold has been giving the opposite signal to the preemptive drop from late September. Essentially, gold has moved sideways in a consolidation since that date, even as the dollar has continued to rise.

What gold is saying over the last few weeks is that it doesn't "believe" the dollar's most recent advance is going to last.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Watching for a Top in the US Dollar</strong>

Refer back to the US dollar index chart at the top of the article.

Again, the dollar has broken higher from the wedge consolidation defined by the two converging trendlines since May of this year. Closing at 98 on the dollar index last week, it has been the 3 point move higher from 95 to 98 which has resulted in gold's drop from $1,315 to $1,250.

The dollar is now nearing another test of the 100 level on the index, a measure which has acted as resistance for the last two years.

&nbsp;

We will be watching the action in the US dollar index carefully over the next few weeks. <strong>Should the dollar further levitate toward the 100 resistance zone while gold continues to hold its recent lows, it will be a strong signal that the dollar is putting in a long-term top in this region.</strong> Accordingly, the most recent decline in gold will be seen to be simply the first minor correction in the early phases of a long-term secular advance higher, an advance that ultimately should correspond with a worldwide awakening to the knowledge that all currencies -- not just the US dollar -- are inherently flawed in their present fiat form.

That said, and as we have witnessed, we should expect the most sizeable moves in gold to occur opposite the US dollar, as a weakening in the world's reserve currency will have an outsized impact on the entire world financial system as it is defined in the post-Bretton Woods era.

Let us watch the related moves in the dollar index and gold closely over the next several weeks.
<h2>Gold Analysis</h2>
For the week, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> was up $3 from the Friday prior to close near $1,255 on the New York COMEX exchange.

The historic store of wealth is attempting to stabilize in the strong support zone we have identified below in green. Notably, thus far despite several intraday drops into the zone, buyers have stepped in each time and the precious metals has closed each day above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire December through July advance. This level comes in at $1,251.

&nbsp;

The higher within the zone of $1,200 - $1,251 that gold can stabilize, the more likely that the long-term downtrend line (magenta color) will be broken on the next series of attempts, which early estimates suggest could occur as early as December.

As technical-based analysts also looking at downside potential, we continue to identify the $1,173 price level as the final "must hold" zone for gold's new bull market. If this level were to breach, it would tell us that -- despite the fundamentals that we know to be true (worldwide central bank money printing, unprecedented low interest rates, unsustainable debt levels) -- another fundamental factor must then be impacting the markets that we must not be fully aware of.

One of the founding principles of our investment philosophy is we cannot possibly know ever factor that is impacting a set market at a given time, because the market is composed of hundreds of millions of individuals, each with their own set of hopes, fears, strengths, weaknesses, assumptions, research, and goals.

Yet to be successful, we do not need to know what each individual is thinking. By paying attention to the sum of the market -- which manifests in the price that is printed each day -- we can align ourselves with the strongest trend as it is occurring.

We have no desire to be right on the fundamentals but wrong on the actual market, a problem which plagues many fundamental-only based investors. As of now, it still appears that the December bottom was an important long-term flexion point... but if anything changes this outlook, we will be sharing it with you here.

		<title>Trump&#039;s Unexpected Victory, Markets Reverse Course</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Donald Trump clinched an unexpected victory for the US Presidential election on Tuesday, which sent major world markets into a temporary panic.  Gold surged, stocks dropped limit-down in the overnight hours, and it appeared gold was on the verge of the technical breakout from the long-term downtrend that we have been monitoring for almost half a year now.

Yet just 12 hours after the election results became known, the markets saw quick reversals of the prior movements, with precious metals and other safety assets being dumped, and risk assets including broad stocks and industrial commodities being bought strongly.

We remain long-term bullish on precious metals for the fundamental reasons that we all know to be true: central bank money printing, government bailouts of private corporations, uncontrollable debt, and negative interest rates in several major nations worldwide.

Yet the challenge at this moment is to come back to a central investment principle: do not fight the market.

What this means is that, as individuals and investors, we may have opinions on what the market should do. We may have fundamental data from sound research to back up those opinions. We may have done thorough due diligence. Yet despite all this, if the market moves opposite to our fundamental research, we must consider that there is more information impacting the market than we are factoring into our equations.

The old investment adage is helpful to remember: "The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."
<h2>Markets Turn After Trump's Victory</h2>
Immediately in the aftermath of the Trump election victory, most major world markets reversed course abruptly and strongly.

Gold and silver, which were up significantly in the hours after Trump's win was decided, reversed suddenly and finished lower for the week. Gold hit a high of $1,335 in the early morning hours on Wednesday, only to close the week near $1,225, almost a $110 drop in just over 48 hours.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-903" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a_TrumpVictory-stocks-dollar-gold-silver.jpg" alt="trump-victory-stocks-dollar-gold-silver" width="1500" height="1125" />

&nbsp;

Similarly, the US dollar and the US stock market, which were showing 2.5% and 5% losses in the overnight hours after the election, reversed course and both finished higher by over 1%, respectively. These are notable intra-week swings.

But it was not only gold and precious metals that fell after the initial surge on Tuesday night. Long-term 20+ year US bonds also dropped, falling over 6% in the last three trading days of the week. This is a huge drop for the bond market, to the extent that 20-year interest rates rose from 2.26% to 2.58% in just one week. This is one of the largest single-week drops in bond prices / increase in bond interest rates seen in the last 20 years.

In sum, after the initial fear reaction as a result of Trump's victory, most major markets did a 180-degree turn and reversed. Safety assets were sold across the board, and risk assets recovered to turn positive.

Let us switch the above chart to view the action in metals only. We are including both precious and industrial metals in the following chart.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-904" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b_Trump-Victory-precious-Metals.jpg" alt="trump-victory-precious-metals" width="1500" height="1125" />

&nbsp;

First, we see that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-copper">copper</a> was the outstanding performer this week, indicating demand for the industrial metals was seen as positive after the Trump election. <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">Palladium</a> came in second, which is, of course, a precious metal with major industrial demand, especially from the automotive industry.

In contrast, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> all fell, the first two being the historic monetary metals.

It appears that markets are pricing in increased industrial demand from the Trump administration and a lesser need for safety assets. We can only speculate as to the reasons for this -- we wonder (half-jokingly): is the wall that Trump intends to build along the US-Mexico border going to be made primarily of copper?

Silver is the outlier. As we know, silver's demand equation still is composed of roughly 80% industrial usage. Why did silver fall more than gold, and not finish the week somewhere in between gold and copper (as it "should" when safety assets fall but industrial assets rise)? What happened to the industrial silver buyers?

Manipulation theories aside (we do not completely discount them, but do not consider them sufficient for making investment decisions), based on the declines seen in US bonds, gold, and platinum, we can only conclude that silver saw large selling from those who were previously holding the metal for its safety / monetary role. We may not agree with their decision to sell, but sell is what they did.

A quick view of the copper chart from 2010 through present reveals the significance of the surge seen in the primary-industrial metal this week: no less than a breakout from the long-term declining trendline since the 2011 highs. [Note: this is the same relative trendline that has been so elusive for gold, from which it has failed to break higher for the past five months. From the copper surge seen this week it should be apparent why we place emphasis on the potential breaking of these long-term trends.]

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-905" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/c_Copper-spot-price-elections.png" alt="copper-spot-price-elections" width="1067" height="799" />

&nbsp;

In sum, copper was up an incredible 10.7% for the week and looks like it is entering a new bull market after five years of declines.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold Analysis</h2>
For the week, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price per ounce</a> fell $80 or 6.1% to finish at $1,224. Yet more significant was the nearly $110 swing from $1,335 on Wednesday to the Friday close.

<strong>The Wednesday reversal consisted of the highest ever single-day volume of contracts traded on the New York COMEX exchange, at 780,000.</strong> This is nearly four times the average daily volume.

Because this historic volume occurred on a reversal day, the $1,335 high is going to require multiple attempts or an equally-high record-breaking volume surge to break through this level on any subsequent rally.

Viewing gold technically, the metal is making a lower low within the strong support zone that we would expect to hold if gold is still in a new bull market. This zone extends down to $1,200, precisely.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-906" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/d_gold-spot-price-elections.png" alt="d_gold-spot-price-elections" width="1125" height="843" />

&nbsp;

The "Must Hold Zone", as defined by $1,173, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the advance, would be the lowest level that we have observed new bull markets to fall while still being in a primary overall advance. A break below that level and quick retests of $1,045 would occur at minimum.

		<title>Dollar Surges, Bonds Fall in Trump Aftermath</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/11/21/dollar-surges-bonds-fall-trump-aftermath/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the wake of the Trump election, the US dollar has broken out higher from the two-year consolidation that we have been watching now for many months. Held between the 92 support level and the 100 resistance zone since the beginning of 2015, the dollar hit a high of 101.5 last week, decisively breaking through the aforementioned resistance.

This is important to monitor because over the short and intermediate-term, the precious metals often move counter to the value of the US dollar. (Over the long run, we can clearly observe that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is rising regardless of fluctuations in the US dollar versus other world currencies. More on this below.)

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-914" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a_US-Dollar-index.png" alt="us-dollar-index" width="1055" height="627" />

&nbsp;

The target for a successful breakout of this nature is derived as equal to the amplitude of the prior consolidation. The fundamental reason for this target is that an equal number of trapped short-sellers who placed their bets during the consolidation are likely to cover their shorts as the breakout advances, thus driving the dollar higher. The prior consolidation featured an 8 point amplitude (100 - 92). Thus, we expect the US dollar to advance to approximately 108 on the index over the next 6-12 months.

If <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> were to fall below $1,200 and toward the 2015 lows of $1,045 again, it would be because paper traders are reacting to this advance now setting up in the dollar.

Longer term, let us never forget that an attempt to determine what the price of gold will be at a given value of the US dollar versus other depreciating currencies is akin to trying to decide which ship is best to stay on amidst the certainty that all ships will sink during an approaching typhoon.

The truth is: all ships will be sinking, just at different rates. Gold is the life raft.

The proof for this can be seen in the long-term view of the <strong>US dollar index versus gold</strong>, where we update the levels at which gold has traded corresponding to the 100 point on the dollar index. Note that since 1980, gold has traded at $700, $275, $375, and $1,200 all while the US dollar has essentially made a round trip back to 100.

As the mainstream media continuously attempts to discredit gold based on movements in the dollar index, it is important that we keep this long-term perspective in mind at all times.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-915" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b_USDGold.png" alt="gold-usd-index" width="1080" height="951" />
<h2>Bond Selling Continues After Trump Victory</h2>
US bonds continue to see major selling since Trump's victory, to the extent that the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond has seen its interest rate rise from 2.55% to 3.01% since the election.

We have long speculated that the final top to the unprecedented 36-year advance in US bonds was nearing an end. Yet bull markets typically end with a bang and not a whimper, and this backdrop usually takes the form of a bubble during the later stages. Bubbles can be spotted on the charts as a multi-year linear advance becomes parabolic during its later stages.

The selling seen over the last two weeks in the bond market brings this idea to the forefront, as bond prices have hit 152, just touching the parabolic curve (blue on the chart below) that we believe is setting up to mark the bubble-like end of this long-term advance.

The only question is: do bond prices have one final surge higher to go to mark a true mania phase in US paper, or has the top already been put into place?

The two trajectories, one envisioning a final blow-off phase for bonds and one assuming that the top has already been put into place, are outlined in green below.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-916" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/c_US-Bond-price-november-2016.png" alt="us-bond-price-november-2016" width="1064" height="632" />
A determining characteristic of bubbles is that they go on longer and higher than almost anyone can fathom, so whether the final top was just put into place, or whether there needs to be one final surge to new all-time highs in bond prices remains to be seen. What we can say is that most people alive today have never seen a bear market in bond prices during their investment careers -- and now after 36 years of rising, it is equally fathomable that bond prices could see 36 years of selling. The ramifications of this are unimaginable, but due to unprecedented debt levels worldwide, most governments could not withstand interest rates above 5%, let alone rates near 14% or 15%, as were seen during the 1970's and 1980's.

Will governments insist that central banks be their buyers of last resort as legitimate demand for bonds falls in the coming years?

The only source of funding that central banks have for this is the printing press (i.e. electronic equivalent). Future gold prices will thus be largely impacted by the bursting of the bond bubble.

----------

Thursday, November 24 is Thanksgiving here in the United States. Major markets will be closed. There will be a half-day (until 1:00pm) of trading on Friday. In sum, markets should be rather slow starting Wednesday afternoon through the end of the week.

Happy Thanksgiving and enjoy the long weekend ahead!

		<title>Gold: Looking for Double Bottom?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Let us be very clear: we are bullish on precious metals over the long term. Yet over the intermediate timeframe, the market is giving us signals that the long-term bottoms we are expecting to form may take a more complex path than was originally anticipated. We should stay nimble and be prepared for some twists and turns going forward.

For the last week, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> fell by $30 to close at $1,183 as of the NY COMEX final print, a 2.4% loss for the week. Notably, the low for the week came late Thursday night EST / early Friday morning in Asia, at near $1,171, before bouncing, touching the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement line of the entire December through July advance, and the final "Must Hold" support zone that we have been monitoring for some months.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-938" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a_Gold-price-november-2016.png" alt="gold-price-november-2016" width="1195" height="895" />

&nbsp;

If <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is going to put in a low in this region, it must immediately rise this week above the $1,200 level and maintain a weekly close there. This would turn the break below the $1,200 level into a "false breakdown", and would require us to re-examine the possibility that the next advance is indeed underway. Such fake-outs do occur in all markets periodically, and the only way to identify them is to maintain a close watch of the key support/resistance levels. This is the only scenario in which we could consider the initial advance from 2015 to still be continuing.

However, the bulk of the evidence now in front of us leads to the conclusion that gold will need to at least retest the region of its 2015 lows, if not break below them, as part of a more complex multi-year bottoming formation.

The support below $1,173 is negligible for gold, down to the 2015 lows. Strong support levels are primarily defined by prior periods of consolidative action, and in the case of gold that consolidation took place between $1,200 and $1,305 from February to June. The fact that gold saw little to no buying interest at $1,200 last week indicates those buyers who bought the dips toward $1,200 last spring are no longer participating in the market.

Why are they no longer present? We cannot know. Those buyers were a diverse group of institutions, individuals, and funds from around the world, so we cannot possibly identify a single cause for their sum lack of participation. All we can know is what they (the market) are doing, and align ourselves for the highest probability of success.

Below $1,173, we will next look for a bottom in gold indicated by the new green shading on the chart above, which corresponds to the consolidation seen from November 2015 through early January 2016. This zone of $1,045 - $1,085 is where we would look for the possibility of gold to form a double bottom. The term double bottom is derived precisely because the price reached this level once before, and then comes back to retest (if successful) this level for a second time.

&nbsp;

<strong>Technical Clues for the Next Bottom</strong>

No matter what the exact low price that forms for gold, we will be looking for a specific set of bottoming patterns to come into play. One of the most important bottom indicators will be to watch for a period of outperformance of the mining sector versus the metal itself. As an example, if gold were to fall to $1,045 again, we should expect to see the mining complex bottom several points above its related 2015 lows, as measured either by either the HUI or GDX index.

We will also be looking for a downtrend break in gold, as well as any other number of confirming bottoming patterns: bottoming wedge, inverse head and shoulders, gold outperformance versus CRB commodity index, etc.

These are the bottoming indicators that worked in 2008 as well as 2015, and at least several of them will allow us to target the next bottom as it approaches. Of course, we will not catch the exact bottom to the day -- but the truth is no one will. We will, however, be able to observe the shift in the market for what should be a move equal to, if not greater than, the 2016 initial advance.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>1999 - 2001 Gold Example</strong>

As an example, here is how the last long-term bottom in gold formed, from 1999 - 2001. The pattern featured a support zone between $250 and $265, with an initial advance to $337, a 34% surge that gave back almost all of its gains into the double bottom of 2001. Downtrend breaks were noted in successive fashion in November 2000 and then again in May 2001.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b_Gold-1999-2001-double-bottom.png" alt="gold-1999-2001-double-bottom" width="1177" height="857" />

&nbsp;

For long-term investors, any purchases within the 1999 - 2001 period, even at the $337 peak, were eventually seen to be excellent value once the price of gold exceeded the initial advance in 2002. It then never looked back.

Of course, no two periods in history will match exactly, but the point is that a set of potential patterns exist which tend to define most bottoms, and we fully expect to identify the next one to come.

&nbsp;

<strong>Gold: Looking Forward</strong>

As a working hypothesis, with the expectation of a double bottom to form in gold, we propose the following trajectory for gold over the subsequent two years:

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-940" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/c_Gold-2009-downtrend.png" alt="gold-2009-downtrend" width="1208" height="904" />

&nbsp;

The primary 2013 - 2015 downtrend channel for gold, which was broken in February and shown in light blue, would be set up to act as a second support level for gold near the $1,045 double bottom.

A successful double bottom would then set up gold to challenge its long-term (magenta color) downtrend again in late 2017, with the expectation of a successful breakout either then or in early 2018. By this time, the downtrend would come in much lower, near $1,200. Yet its significance would be no less.

For comparison, we continue to monitor the incredible action taking place in the copper market over the last month. In just four weeks, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">copper</a> has surged 28% to $2.67 per pound.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-941" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/d_Copper-2010-2016.png" alt="copper-2010-2016" width="1203" height="900" />

&nbsp;

A similar 28% percentage gain, should gold break its long-term downtrend next year at $1,200, would result in a surge to $1,536 within four weeks. Such is the type of move we want to be positioned for ahead of time.

		<title>Deutsche Bank Settles in Gold-Fixing Lawsuit</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/12/05/deutsche-bank-settles-gold-fixing-lawsuit/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Friday, Deutsche Bank agreed to settle privately for antitrust litigation brought against the German bank by traders and investors who accused the company of conspiring to fix <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold prices</a> at their expense.

This case holds special interest to me personally, as I was contacted by the prosecuting counsel and gave testimony to some of the dubious trading patterns I have observed over the years participating in the futures market.

<img class="size-full wp-image-961 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Deutsche-Bank-Gold-Dold-Settlement.jpg" alt="deutsche-bank-gold-settlement" width="600" height="300" />

The preliminary settlement was filed in New York this week, and consists of a $60M package.

This follows a similar settlement the bank agreed to pay in October of $38M for conspiring to fix <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver prices</a>.

It still remains to be seen which classes of traders or investors are eligible to receive compensation from the settlement, and the total payout per individual is unlikely to amount to more than a few hundred dollars.

Further, it should be noted that the combined settlements of $98M represent a tiny fraction of the bank's $47 billion revenue for 2015. So the settlement will have negligible impact on the company.

Deutsche Bank officially denies wrongdoing. However, the fact that the bank is willing to settle the case is unprecedented in and of itself. Here we have, for the first time, a large multi-national bank agreeing to settle for actions related to manipulation of the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/category/precious-metals-investing/">precious metals markets</a>.

With this settlement, it is possible that further class action lawsuits could be brought against Deutsche Bank by other parties in coming years.

Four other banks who were also listed as defendants in the case have not agreed to settle yet: Barclays, Bank of Nova Scotia, HSBC, and Societe Generale. Should the case go to trial, a ruling against these banks could result in much harsher penalties than the $98M Deutsche Bank is paying?

&nbsp;

<strong>Manipulation Theories Go Mainstream</strong>

In years past, theories that banks were attempting to manipulate <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">precious metals prices</a> were considered the realm of conspiracy theorists and dismissed by the mainstream media.

However, it is increasingly clear that the precious metals markets represent a special focal point for many institutions, and attempts to manipulate their values are indeed occurring.

It has long been my contention that such manipulation attempts do occur. However, I also believe that such attempts are not more powerful than the market forces itself. Ultimately, the market will win out, and attempts at suppression will fail. This is a lesson from countless examples throughout history: attempts to suppress a given market only result in that market moving higher once the suppression is overwhelmed.

No matter whether the market action on a given day or week is related to manipulative attempts or to legitimate buying and selling, we should still pay attention to where price signals appear on the charts. Both manipulation and legitimate market action do impact the prices at which we must buy and sell physical metal, as well as the revenues and hence market valuations of the companies that mine for the metals in the ground.

Over the long run, we should not want to be involved with the precious metals if they could be manipulated ad infinitum. The fact that we as investors are here means we must have faith that such suppression will fail and the market forces will seek true values.

Over the next few months, we will continue to monitor the settlement and litigation proceedings of these cases, and report on any actions that individual investors should take on the possibility of reparation payments.

<h2>Italians Vote "No" -- Signals Establishment Discontent</h2>
Early Monday morning, we received reports that Italians have voted "no" on Premier Matteo Renzi's reform referendum, and further reports that Renzi will resign on Monday.

The outcome is generally seen as representing a victory for "anti-establishment" voters. The reform referendum was strongly backed by Italy's corporations, banks, and establishment institutions, so the defeat sends a message that is similar in context to Britain's Brexit vote and Trump's victory here in the US.

<img class="size-full wp-image-962 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Italians-Vote-No-Signals-Establishment-Discontent.jpg" alt="italians-vote-no-signals-establishment-discontent" width="600" height="300" />

Here we see over the last six months three major western nations delivering strong anti-establishment and anti-globalist messages to their politicians.

While the impact to the precious metals markets have been minor in the overnight Asian trading immediately following the vote, clearly, the "wind of change" that is blowing in various corners of the political world is gaining in momentum...

&nbsp;

<strong>A Political to Economic Trend?</strong>

From a dual political/economic standpoint, we cannot help but wonder: when will even a small fraction of those discontented with the current system (and willing to vote against it in an election) connect the dots and vote against the same system even more tangibly by selling the local currency and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">buying gold</a> / <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silve</a> instead? It would not take many of the world's discontented citizens to simply buy a few ounces of silver or a single ounce of gold for the prices to skyrocket to multiples of the current level.

The timing for this scenario remains speculative still, but we can indeed see shifts in sentiment in front of our eyes. One thing is for sure: political systems and their fiat currencies are intrinsically related... and no amount of manipulation from Deutsche Bank or any other institution will be able to hold back the "voting" of the global currency market when it finally moves in favor of gold.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Having fallen for five weeks straight since the Trump victory, gold this week broke through its final technical support of the 2016 advance, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the entire surge, at $1,173, so we must now shift our focus toward identifying the next low that is set to come. For the week, gold fell 1.4% to close at $1,159 as of the final electronic trade in New York on Friday.

The intermediate-term 3-year chart is the most helpful perspective at this juncture:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/a_Gold-december-2016.png" alt="gold-price-december-2016" width="1201" height="899" />

&nbsp;

Two weeks ago, we highlighted the example of the 1999-2001 double bottom for gold, and how this might look should the same pattern play out again, 16 years later. Having seen the continued weakness in gold over the last two weeks, let us now focus on some additional specifics.

The 2013 - 2015 downtrend channel, seemingly forgotten last summer, is the next potential whereby gold should attempt to begin carving out a double bottom. For reference, the channel was formed by five separate hits each on the upper and lower trendlines from 2013 onward, as shown above by the red and orange highlight circles on the chart. It was as clear of a trend channel as we could possibly ask for -- and it was broken in February 2016 as gold exceeded $1,190.

Since that trend channel was indeed declining, even though gold has now come back below the $1,190 breakout point, the precious metal still finds itself above the upper boundary of the channel.

Markets often come back to re-test broken lines and channels, and in this case <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> looks to be setting up for that retest within the next 3-4 months.

The retest of the trend channel should correspond, plus or minus a few percentage points, with the low for the 2015 bottom, at $1,045. Typically in long-term double bottom scenarios, the second low will fail to reach the depths of the initial low by several percentage points. <strong>Thus, our <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/11/28/gold-double-bottom/">double bottom</a> potential exists from $1,045 through $1,080, </strong>as shown by the green band above. The possibility of a nominal new low in gold forming alongside a double bottom in the gold mining sector should also not be ruled out.
<h2>Silver Update</h2>
Silver finished the week positive for the second week in a row, up $0.13 or 0.80% to close at $16.97 as of the final COMEX trade in New York.

This was the second week in a row that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver spot price</a> has moved in an opposite direction as gold when viewing the weekly closing prices. Silver outperformance should be noted to be positive relative strength, which has ramifications for the entire sector, and fitting in with our thesis that a complex long-term bottom is forming in the precious metals, even if the absolute lows remain ahead of us.

The rally this week was halted exactly at the broken support-turned-resistance zone shown below by the black line at $17.25. A break above this $17.25 resistance would hint that a short-term bottom is in the process of forming, although we will feel much more comfortable that the larger decline is over when the upper blue downtrend line is broken, which now comes in at $18.45.

		<title>Gold to Silver Ratio Analysis</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As shown on the chart below, the defining characteristic of the decline in gold and silver prices since the July/August highs has been the rising trend in the gold to silver ratio.

Of course, this ratio measures the number of <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">ounces of silver</a> needed to purchase one <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">ounce of gold</a>.

The fall in the gold/silver ratio from above 80 in January to 64 in early July corresponded to the advances in both metals with outperformance by silver. However, the rise in the gold/silver ratio since July from 64 to 68 as both metals have declined has shown only marginal outperformance by gold.

In other words, as a sum, since the beginning of the year, silver has outperformed gold when viewing the entirety of the advance and subsequent retracement.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/gold-silver-ratio-2016.png" alt="gold-silver-ratio-2016" width="1206" height="717" />

&nbsp;

<strong>Silver's 2016 Outperformance in Perspective</strong>

The major gold/silver ratio trend breakdown in April (first red highlight circle) was a defining change in the ongoing pattern, after nearly five years of rising in favor of gold (large turquoise channel).

The initial wave lower in the gold/silver ratio (corresponding with rising metals prices) lasted through September. While this initial wave lower was halted at the end of September, we do not expect the former 2011 - 2016 rising channel to be regained again.

In other words: silver outperformance is likely over a multi-year period ahead, even though it will underperform gold during sometimes lengthy corrections.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Different Strategies for Different Investors</strong>

Of course, each precious metals investor comes to the sector with a different set of goals, a different time horizon, and a different tolerance for risk. Whereas long-term investors may find dollar-cost averaging into the lows to be a helpful strategy, those with a shorter-term time horizon may want to focus on following some of these technical indicators along with us.

Those wanting to hold <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> as "wealth insurance" in case of political or economic turmoil are reminded that the best time to buy an insurance policy is not when it has gone up in price, but when it has come down. And those insurance policies are now some $200 cheaper per ounce than they were in mid-summer.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How a change in Sharia Law can increase a demand for gold?</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/12/15/change-sharia-law-can-increase-demand-gold/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The prospect of the precious metals market could set an absolutely new path in December 2016 because of the new “Gold standard” in the Sharia law. The financial and personal lives of Muslims are guided by Sharia law, which doesn’t allow to trade gold for the future value, interests or speculation. The gold as a ribawi item can be sold only on weight and measure and used as a jewelry, but not as a prosperity. However, there has been a need for clarification for how gold bullion can be used for investment purposes by Muslims for a long time. Islamic investors have always had access to the gold market through jewelry and coins, this guidance will vastly increase the number and diversity of investment products available.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The possibility of many potential Muslim investors has been limited because this law and it could be a revolutionary change for the precious metals market if the Sharia gold standard will be developed. This upcoming clarification could open the gold market to millions Muslims under Sharia law and also causes a further spike in <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically Islamic financial market has had an important international influence, even the investors have had access to the gold market only through jewelry and coins, this change will let Muslim market become much more powerful. For this reason, it is not a surprise, that, the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) and the World Gold Council have approved a ground-breaking initiative, that will become known as the</span><b> “Sharia Gold Standard”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Islamic world will play an increasingly important role for the gold price demand, which has been structured by Western ideas for a long time. Most people don’t realize how rare gold really is, but the fact is there are only 6.4 billion ounces of aboveground gold on the planet, so millions of the potential new buyers can bring a lot of competition to the market game. Muslim investors will be able to take an advantage of the increasing back of range and bring a lot of competition into the investment world.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sharia-law-gold.jpg" alt="sharia law gold" width="342" height="328" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the global reports in 2015 China was the largest gold buyer (average number of sold gold is 1,000 tons). Since gold has a long history with Muslims -- as a currency and store of wealth -- it's expected Muslim investors will quickly embrace gold investment products such as coins, bars and include gold savings plans, gold certificates, certain gold futures and gold mining stocks in their financial goals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This new law would set a future path for gold products and put a real pressure on metals as they would become more expensive. Due to the general economy situation in the world the most banks have added gold to their reserves since the financial crisis of 2007/2008. But currently there are still two Muslim countries (Turkey and Saudi Arabia) that included in the top 20 of the world’s gold reserve holdings and they will definitely try to get as much value as they can for their fund.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment analytics all around the world announce that it’s not unreasonable to expect a good bump up in the gold prices as soon as Wall Street prepares for the annual Federal Reserve meeting. These last weeks are considered to be very intense and changing for industrial metals dynamic. For this reason, we here at Bullion Exchanges believe this is a really great time to add value to your profitable precious metals portfolio and buy old before it will be additionally appealing on the Muslim market. We offer a great selection of </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold products</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including the latest 2017 releases at low prices. Also, you can go through our selection of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver products</a> f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or being able to diversify your portfolio with the silver bullion and be sure that your collection is secured from all sides and will no longer be under raising prices impact.</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Gold &amp; Silver Approaching Interim Lows</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/12/27/gold-silver-approaching-interim-lows/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[2016 has been one of the most volatile years on record for gold: the best first-half performance in 40 years, followed by the ongoing retracement that has seen the bulk of the gains for the metal itself given back.

These moves have left many wondering if this was just a "false rally" in the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">price of gold</a> on the way to a continuation of the 2011-2015 bear market. And while no one can ever say with 100% certainty what the future will bring, with a clear technical view of the markets we are now in the best possible position to capture the moves that lie ahead when they do indeed materialize.

As there are still four trading days left in the year, we will wait until next week to offer a full 2016 year-end review of the precious metals markets and a look ahead for 2017.
<h3>Gold Analysis</h3>
Turning to spot gold itself, the pre-Christmas week featured relatively light trading, with prices finishing at $1,133 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX. Such represents a loss of $3.80 or 0.3% from a week prior.

Notably, this was the seventh weekly loss for gold in a row, the longest such stretch since May 2004. This is an interesting statistic to contemplate. Consider, for instance, that <strong>the last time gold fell for so many weeks in a row was during the early stages of the 2001 - 2011 bull market, </strong>not during a bear market. It is often said that the most severe (percentage per time unit) declines happen during bull markets, as prices must climb a "wall of worry". Will this hold true again? We will know shortly.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1056 size-full" title="Gold-2013-2016" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/a_Gold-2013-2016.png" alt="Gold-2013-2016" width="1205" height="902" />

&nbsp;

Technically, gold is now within sight of the declining broken 2013 - 2015 trend channel we have been monitoring for several weeks, shown in blue above. If the price were to use the broken trendline as support this week, the level to watch for a bounce would be $1,100 precisely. Such a rebound would indicate the potential for a higher-low to form in gold than in 2015. The 2015 bottom zone is labeled by the green band above as between $1,045 - $1,080.

We would place a stronger trust in the low if it were to form as a confluence of the broken blue trendline and the $1,045 - $1,080 support zone. For those two regions to overlap, the bottom would need to wait for the trendline to decline from its current reading at $1,100. Based on the slope of the line, that convergence would happen between February and May of the coming year.

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> is still largely oversold on the daily RSI indicator (red circle, top of chart) below the 30 level, a reading which has corresponded with previous medium-term lows over the past 18 months.

In sum, a short-term bounce should be expected at any moment in gold; however, long-term bottom signals require several converging technical patterns, for which we are still waiting across both the metal and the mining complex.
<h3>Silver Analysis</h3>
<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver spot price</a> fell further than gold again this week, giving up the relative outperformance we had noted during late November and early December versus gold. For the week, silver declined 2.8% or $0.46 cents, to close at $15.76 as of the last trade in New York.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1057" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/b_Silver-price-decemder-2016.png" alt="Silver-price-december-2016" width="1199" height="898" />

&nbsp;

We would like to call your attention to the <u>short-term steep wedge</u> formation now visible on the silver chart above, shown between the teal and blue trendlines. As periodically mentioned, these wedge formation typically represent reversal or bottoming patterns. In this case, we see steep declining highs since early November, and less steep lows forming since July.

While silver could fall further still within the wedge pattern, <strong>a break of the upper trendline should represent a tradable breakout </strong>for those so inclined to initiate short-term trades<strong>.</strong> On the breakout, an initial target will be $16.25, the broken support from November, with a possibility of an advance toward $17.25, the resistance from early December.

<u>However, a word of caution</u>: breaks from wedges as steep as above cannot be relied upon to represent terminal bottoms in and of themselves. The old investment adage: "The steeper the trend, the less important the break," comes to mind here, and is relevant because the wedge in question is extremely steep (for comparison, a less-steep long-term wedge was observed from 2013 - 2015 in the silver market, and represented a much stronger candidate for a bottom).

Because this wedge is so steep, it may not represent the final low for this retracement in silver. However, it should mark an end to the most severe portion of silver's decline.

Another way to visualize the steepness of silver's recent decline-- and hence likelihood of a rebound in the near future -- is to note that the slope can be observed to be forming a reverse parabolic curve since the summer highs, which is approaching an infinite downward rate by late January. Since such an infinite negative slope is impossible for an asset that cannot go to zero, we know that the current rate of decline will necessarily end in the next few weeks, and such should represent the tradable bounce at minimum. The only question is: does silver make its bounce sooner, or after one final drop over the next two weeks. Both options are highlighted in green, below, on the SLV chart (proxy for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver bullion</a>, used to show intraday price/volume data).

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1058" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/c_SLV-chart-ST-december-2016.png" alt="SLV-chart-ST-december-2016" width="1110" height="830" />

&nbsp;

The key technical point is to watch for the break of the wedge as shown on the main silver chart above to indicate when the worst of the retracement in silver is over.

We will put the full-year relative price performance together for gold, silver, and related markets in our 2016 review, next week.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the arrival of 2017 and another year in the record books, we take a look back at the closing data for 2016 and the major trends that impacted world markets.

For the year, across the major asset classes that we follow, we note the following 2016 ending performances:

&nbsp;

</tbody>
</table>
</div>
In sum, despite the wild volatility, the precious metals put in respectable performances for the full year. These were the first gains for the metals on a yearly basis since 2012, which may indicate the beginning of a trend change.
<h3>"No Confidence" Goes Mainstream</h3>
The most significant theme that we perceived across the political landscape for 2016 was a vote of "no confidence" in the establishment regime. This growing voice of dissent was evident across three major political votes during the year and countless smaller movements worldwide.

First was the vote by British citizens to leave the EU in June. Dubbed "Brexit", the vote came as a surprise to most major polling and media outlets. Central causes of the British dissent are believed to focus on issues of the economy, immigration, and sovereignty. And while a debate of those issues is beyond the scope of this publication, we can clearly observe the net result: the resignation of Prime Minster David Cameron and a major signal of dissatisfaction by UK residents toward the established political regime.

Second came Donald Trump's election in November. Again largely dismissed by the mainstream media and polling organizations even up until the night of the election, the Trump victory came as a surprise to many. Trump will be the first US President to never hold prior political office. A significant message that we take away from the US election is that there are many more voters dissatisfied with the largely superficial "Republican/Democrat" divide than were previously believed to have existed. We did not officially endorse either candidate in the US election; yet clearly there is a growing sense of "no confidence" in the political system here in the United States, and many voters chose to voice that sentiment through a vote for Trump.

Last but not least, the Italian citizens delivered a third anti-establishment vote in rejecting the constitutional amendment proposed by then-Prime Minster Matteo Renzi in December. Largely perceived as supportive of large banks and corporations, Italians rejected the amendment by a final count of over 59%. Renzi resigned the next day.
<h3>The Seeds of a Precious Metals Bull Market Are Being Sown</h3>
Angst in the political system is currently being voiced through the democratic process.

However, it is only a matter of time before that distrust is voiced further through the monetary system. When individuals begin to wake up to the understanding that they are being robbed by the central banks -- <em>regardless of which party is voted in or out of office</em> -- they will then move to vote separately with their pocketbooks. And as <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver spot price</a> remain to this day the only assets completely outside the control of major governments or central banks, they remain the focal point of the growing movement against establishment political planning.

This theme of distrust by citizens toward their established political systems and central banks is a key component of our fundamental investment thesis for precious metals.

As of 2016, still relatively few citizens of the major democratic nations have any knowledge whatsoever regarding precious metals, and even fewer own the monetary assets. In our every day lives, how many people do we know who actually own precious metals in any form? I would urge readers to do some random polling at their workplace, at the coffee shop, at the grocery store, etc. If your experience is anything like mine, you will find that the metals are still barely even known as a legitimate asset class amongst average Americans.

Let us examine the silver market: current estimates show that only 2 billion ounces of silver exist in the investable form above ground.

What if 10% of the combined population of the United States, Great Britain, and Italy each wanted to buy 100 ounces of silver, a modest $1,600 at today's prices?

Our back-of-the-envelope math shows that the combined population of those three countries is 450 million. So if 45 million citizens each wanted to buy 100 ounces of silver, the net result would be a new demand of 4.5 billion ounces.

The silver is not there. The result of such demand coming into such a small market would be that the price would be forced upward by many-fold, as the total dollar amount of metal available for purchase pales in comparison to the dollar supply floating around in individuals' bank accounts.

Even though the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> total market size is much larger than that of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, we have data to show that even gold is widely under-owned to this day. Below we show gold as a percentage of global financial assets (data courtesy CPM).

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1067" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/b_gold-percentgold-global-financial-assets.png" alt="gold-percentgold-global-financial-assets" width="757" height="454" />

&nbsp;

At just under 0.7% of global assets, gold would need to rise four-fold to reach the relative peak set in 1980 when it first hit $850/oz and silver briefly touched $50. As silver remains below its 1980 peak to this day, its advance would likely be greater than gold on a percentage basis.

Momentum is gaining in opposition to the status quo political landscape, and 2016 saw evidence in three major western nations. Those voters are willing to step out and cast a ballot. It is only a matter of time before a critical mass makes the connection between the political world and the financial world and casts a further vote via a movement of assets into the precious metals market.

		<title>US Bond Bubble Cracking</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/01/09/us-bond-bubble-cracking/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have speculated often over the past year that long-dated US bonds were near the end of their unprecedented 36-year bull market. More evidence continues to show up that the trend has begun to shift and that what we have called the "bond bubble" of the last decade is set to begin deflating.

The chart below shows the price of 30-year US bonds from 1980 through the end of 2016. Note that yields, which are currently just under 3.0 %, move opposite to the bond price.

The final phase of the bubble has coincided with a parabolic rise in the price of bonds since 2011 (shown in blue). Parabolic curves typically define the final stages of a bubble or mania, and the price escalates ever upward in an unsustainable fashion after what was an orderly bull market in years past.

Note the breakdown that has just occurred over the last month, with bond prices piercing the parabolic curve decisively lower. We do not anticipate a collapse in bond prices imminently, but rather a new trend of lower prices and higher yields to begin developing over the coming years.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1105" title="US-Bonds-price-1980-2016" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/a_US-Bonds-price-1980-2016.png" alt="US-Bonds-price-1980-2016" width="1150" height="684" />

&nbsp;

It cannot be overstated how important this shift toward lower bond prices and higher interest rates will be for the majority of world citizens, as the United States -- and by consequence many allied governments -- have become addicted to the cheap credit supplied by an ever-willingness of bond investors to loan the US government money at ever-lower interest rates.

Everything from national defense, to our financial system, to our social welfare programs, to our real estate markets, have been given their capacities and valuations by the availability of cheap credit via the bond market. All investors who have been active in any market for 36 years or less know only falling interest rates as their financial backdrop.

This paradigm is soon to be flipped upside down, and after a generation of falling rates, it is not inconceivable that a generation of rising interest rates is set to come.
<h3>Gold Versus Bonds</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1106 size-full" title="Gold-Bonds-1980-2016" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/b_Gold-Bonds-1980-2016.png" alt="Gold-Bonds-1980-2016" width="952" height="635" />

&nbsp;

We should note that for much of 2016, and especially during the second half, both gold and US bonds have been moving in tandem, rising during Brexit and falling after the Trump victory.

Notwithstanding the slight outperformance by gold, both were considered "safety assets" and investors generally bought and sold both assets together.

This may lead some investors to fear that gold will continue to decline with bonds, if the bond bubble has burst.

Over the long run, we must state that gold and bonds are intrinsically located on opposite ends of the safety spectrum. While <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> has represented money and retained its value for over 5,000 years of history, bonds are essentially paper contracts which are, in many respects, an inferior asset than even US dollars during an inflationary episode.

Whereas US dollars can at least be used now and converted into tangible assets, bonds represent a set number of US dollars to be paid <em>in the future</em>.

Through studying historic inflationary periods, from the 1920’s in Weimar Germany to the 1970’s in the United States, we learn that such episodes, the single worst asset to hold is a bond. Meanwhile, precious metals tend to be the best performers. So while gold and bonds are currently being viewed by the market as both generic "safety assets", this correlation will not continue indefinitely.

Below we can see that the above relationship, when viewed over a proper timeframe, yields a different perspective: since the bond bull market began in 1980, gold moved opposite it for the first 20 years, only to play catch up from 2000 onward, followed by the brief period of high correlation seen recently:

<h3>Gold’s Long-Term Outlook</h3>
Backing out our typical short-term perspective of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> for the longer-term view: we continue to believe that the zone shown in green, between $850 - $1,045 as defined by the confluence of the four important technical levels labeled on the chart, represented the highest likelihood for a long-term bottom after the 2011 – 2015 decline.

Should gold retrace further into the green zone during 2017, we expect it will form a nominal new low in price, perhaps down to $1,000 or $925, as a final bear market bottom. It is quite possible that this low has already been established as of late 2015, with the current retracement representing a higher-low or double-bottom pattern now in formation.

The process that we are navigating in typical weeks through the shorter-term charts represents the complexity with which these longer-term multi-year bottoms form.

		<title>Volatility Expected as Gold Tests $1,200</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold was up nearly $23 last week to finish at $1,196 as of the final trade in New York on Friday. Such was the third weekly gain in a row for the historically-monetary metal.</span>A technical update on the price of gold is in order after our analysis of December 26 came within a few days of identifying the most recent low at $1,120.  Gold is at a technical juncture, the resolution of which is going to play a large role in defining the trend and level of volatility to be expected for 2017.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1151 size-full" title="gold price volatility 2017" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3.png" width="1210" height="905" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The price level between $1,190 and $1,200 is the most important that we are presently watching (black double line, labeled Initial Resistance). This price zone acted as support for gold once in February, once in March, and once again in late May. When a price level acts as support on multiple occasions, it increases the legitimacy of the buying pressure seen there. In essence, we saw the same group of value-buyers step in each time the price approached $1,200 last spring.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, something changed last November as the price retreated in the wake of the reversal, following <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/11/14/trump-victory-markets-reverse-course/">Trump’s victory</a>. The gold price fell through $1,200 with only so much as a two-day bounce. For whatever reason, those buyers who were present through most of 2016 at this level failed to show up in November.</span>
<h3><b>Gold Approaches $1,200 Again</b></h3>
After bouncing at $1,120, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is now approaching the $1,200 region again, this time from the lower side. In technical analysis, a major principle that becomes relevant is that support typically turns into resistance. What this means is that – all things being equal – we would expect that the $1,200 zone, which saw a lack of large buyers suddenly in November, should again see limited buying activity when the price is approached again.

Thus, our general expectation at this juncture is for gold to back off in the current price region, and to begin to retreat back to December 2016’s lows. A likely scenario we will be watching for is a double bottom, or perhaps a higher low to form here in 2017, when compared to 2015 and 2016’s lows of $1,045 and $1,120, respectively.

However, if gold were to surprise us and continue to advance through $1,200 immediately, it would be an important indicator for 2017. It would show us that a new set of buyers had entered the market who were not present during last November’s decline.

Such would have important ramifications for the rest of the year. First, we would set our sights on the next target at $1,251, which was the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire 2016 advance, and beyond that the $1,300 region, which represents the long-term 2011-2016 downtrend that still holds.However, even more importantly, if we see a surge above $1,200 at this juncture, it would represent the beginning of increased volatility for the gold market for the remainder of the year. In essence, we will be seeing a new group of buyers enter the market – and we do not have enough price data to gauge their buying patterns yet. They could be physical buyers who missed out on the 2016 rally, they could be central banks anticipating the need to support currencies, they could be a new class of traders. We cannot be certain on their identities, but we can be certain that they were not present in significant quantities last November -- so their presence must be considered a source of expected volatility over the remainder of 2017.
<h3><b>Gold Volatility Expected</b></h3>
A<img class="alignright wp-image-1152 size-medium" title="where to find the biggest market moves 2017" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2-300x121.png" width="300" height="121" />s an interesting corollary, below is a cutout from last week’s Bloomberg article, with the title shown at right. The article highlights that the options market, which allows investors to make highly-leveraged bets in either direction for an underlying asset, is pricing in the highest volatility of any sector in the world specifically for the precious metals equities in 2017. Shown by the red shaded area below, the options market is pricing in a 34% volatility premium for the large and mid-cap gold producers (GDX) and a 44% volatility premium for the junior miners (GDXJ).

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The implied volatility premium is the portion of the contract value that options writers build into the option price to cover their perceived volatility risk. The higher the implied volatility, the higher the premium that options writers demand to sell the contracts.</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1150 size-full" title="gold stocks options most volatile 2017" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/1.png" width="825" height="333" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While most readers will be primarily concerned with prices for the physical bullion market, there is a price relationship between the companies that mine for gold and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">the price of gold</a> itself. After all, we are talking about two different sides of the same sector.</span>

So if options writers are anticipating the highest volatility of any sector in the world for the precious metals equities, we can be certain they are also expecting volatility in the value of their products, the underlying metals.
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we monitor the price action around $1,200 for gold over the coming week, let us remember that advances and retracements are expected to be increasingly volatile over the coming year, as new classes of investors enter the market. However, with volatility comes opportunity. </span>

Those looking to avoid the expected gyrations this year would do well to consider a strategy of dollar-cost averaging into their positions over a number of months, while those on a more active trading program will benefit by keeping in mind the technical levels mentioned herein.

		<title>President Trump and the Federal Reserve</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

The Trump era is officially upon us. While we are politically-independent here and not officially supportive of either major American party, we believe Trump’s election and inauguration last Friday is part of a larger worldwide trend in the emergence of “no confidence” votes against the mainstream political establishments. Manifesting here in the United States, Trump’s tenure should be a particularly unique period of history to be an observer of, with reverberations to be felt around the world.

Case in point: Trump is the first President in modern history to openly criticize the Federal Reserve for its money-printing practices. Saying Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen should be “ashamed” of keeping interest rates too low (which requires printing money to buy short-dated bonds), accusing the Fed of creating a “false economy” and engaging in “political things” – this is unprecedented rhetoric coming from a presidential candidate during a major campaign.

The Chinese proverb says: <em>“May you live in interesting times.”</em> Indeed.
<h3>The Fed and the White House</h3>
The last president to openly criticize the Fed is believed to have been George H. W. Bush, who spoke about the central bank <em>after</em> his 1992 defeat. Ironically, Bush blamed the Fed for <strong><em>not printing enough</em></strong> money, saying: <em>“I think that if the interest rates had been lowered more dramatically that I would have been re-elected President, because the [economic] recovery that we were in would have been more visible.”</em>

Fast forward to last September, in which the relationship between the White House and the Fed over the preceding generation was perfectly illustrated by Hillary Clinton when she said: <em>“You should not be commenting on Fed actions when you are either running for president or you are president.”</em>

So now we have Trump who indeed seems comfortable commenting on Fed actions while running for president. Will he consider criticizing the central bank while actually in office?

Consider that Rebekah Mercer, daughter of billionaire hedge-fund CEO Robert Mercer, sat on the executive committee of Trump’s transition team. She is expected to play a key role in fostering Trump’s agenda during his presidency. Her father, Robert Mercer, in addition to being head of the famed Renaissance Technologies fund, was the chief backer of the Jackson Hole Summit in August 2015, a private financial symposium designed to stand in contrast to the Fed’s own conference held at the same time and place.

The principle themes of the Mercer-funded summit? <strong>The abolishment of the Federal Reserve and a return to the gold standard</strong>.

With the advisory and financial backing of billionaires with anti-Fed leanings, will Trump be the first president in modern history to question the seemingly omniscient central bank during his term?

And how would most Americans – who are still largely unaware that the US dollar is not backed by any tangible asset – respond to a president questioning the institution that issues our fiat currency?

Any significant move of assets into <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> by a substantial portion of the United States (or world) citizens would cause a price acceleration unlike anything witnessed thus far in our analysis.

This is why, even as we endeavor to profit from the shorter-term swings in price that occur, we always advocate that investors hold a <em>certain</em> portion of their assets in a core metals position, stored as far outside the banking system as reasonably possible.

And so as Trump begins his first full week in office, the first active president to openly criticize the central bank in modern history, we once again try to filter out the charged rhetoric that appears in the mainstream financial and political press and turn as always to the charts.
<h3>US Dollar Update</h3>
In a confounding example of either early-presidential double-talk, or perhaps a reference to the singular currency-devaluation policies of China, Mr. Trump – who spoke so harshly of Federal Reserve money-printing on the campaign trail – stated on Tuesday that the US dollar was “too strong”.

The result on Tuesday was to send the dollar back to 100.2 on the Dollar Index, down over 1% for the day against a basket of foreign currencies.

It is here that words from politicians can become misleading and we must focus on regular identification of key zones on the charts:

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1162" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/a_USD-Dollar-Index-jan-2017.png" alt="USD-Dollar-Index-jan-2017" width="1014" height="881" />


While the dollar has been weak over the last month, roughly corresponding to <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold’s price</a> rise from the December lows, this price action must still be viewed within the context of the breakout from the 2-year consolidation shown above between 92 and 100 on the index.

What we see thus far is simply a higher retest of the breakout zone.

We must respect the dollar breakout until proven otherwise, as it will tend to exert a negative drag on the precious metals in a typical trading environment.

We would consider the move in the dollar to have failed and thus to constitute an ominous long-term “false breakout” should the index close below 99.5, the spike low seen on December 8. Such a failed advance can typically lead to a strong reversal in the opposite direction.

Of course, the dollar and precious metals do not always move in opposite directions, and are sometimes highly correlated, a topic we will examine in more depth in the near future.

Happy investing this week, as we enter what should be a fascinating time to be a market observer if the new president does openly decide to criticize the Fed at any point during the next four years.

That's pure politics. She was probably betting that statement would gain her friends in high places (of all sorts).  You see what happened to JFK when he talked bad about the feds.

It's a statement that is hard to believe that anyone would publicly make.  "Can't talk about it".    Hmmmmm.

I'm hoping gold drops because that would mean things are going well and regular every-day Americans are doing well.    Who would really want gold to sky rocket or be much higher than it is today?

		<title>Gold Technical Update – Short Term Gyrations Amidst Long-Term Bottom</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/01/30/gold-technical-update-long-term-perspective/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold was resilient over the last two weeks in holding up over the $1,200 level, and indeed almost had us fooled that it was about to ignore this resistance and continue to advance higher.  Yet after several failures to mount a sustained advance, gold succumbed to selling pressure by Tuesday. For the week, gold closed down $16 or 1.4% to finish at $1,188 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday.   </span>

Although <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> did push above the $1,200 figure marginally, the message of the market here is of sellers who showed up every time gold attempted to make some distance above the round number. We can thus update our primary gold chart below, with Initial Resistance labeled as $1,200 - $1,215.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1174" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-1.png" alt="Primary Gold Chart " width="1199" height="898" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our short-term expectations for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> continue to call for lower prices. At the same time, we can tentatively draw a new trendline between the December 2015 low and the higher December 2016 low, as shown above in blue (dashed).</span>

It would be extremely healthy action to see the new trendline tested and held for a second time at a nominally higher level, such as $1,130 - $1,135. This is where gold would meet the trend if it were to test it this week.
<h3><b>Gold’s Long-Term Basing Perspective</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Backing out the timeframe, periodically it is beneficial to strip away previous annotations and start with a blank chart, to gauge the big-picture trend of the market.  Below is gold from 2011 to present, with minimal annotations near the current price – instead of with a focus toward the major pattern developing over the last five years:</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1175 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-2.png" alt="Gold Long-term Perspective" width="1203" height="900" />

Despite the weakness is seen since July, what is emerging here in gold is a five-year “cup” base pattern. This basing pattern features multiple swings of $300 higher and lower in both directions – but as a sum, we are observing a clear rounded bottoming pattern, with a reduced rate of decline from 2013 – 2015 now giving way to the beginning of an advancing market.

Strong evidence for the shift in trend can be seen from the fact that the 2016 high of $1,378 clearly exceeded both the 2015 high of $1,305 and the mid-2014 high of $1,345. A bear market is defined by lower peaks – and when a new peak, such as that seen in 2016, exceeds a prior one – it is telling us that the market is in the process of changing behavior.
<h3><b>Anticipating Short-Term Potentials</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, these changes take the time to play out and are filled with wild short-term gyrations. The question that we still cannot definitively answer is: was the recent December 2016 $1,124 low the bottom for the entirety of the correction off 2016’s peak?</span>

The above base scenario assumes that it was – and if so, after a somewhat higher low due to form within the next few weeks, gold should continue two-steps forward, one step backward advances through the remainder of the year to re-challenge the 2016 high at $1,378.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, let us imagine that the recent low does not hold and that gold continues to grind down further for several months – retesting the 2015 bottom in the vicinity of $1,045. The two hypotheticals are presented below through the green target callouts:</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1176" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-3.png" alt="Gold Short-Term Potentials" width="1200" height="913" />

&nbsp;

<b>Neither of the above two scenarios would change the validity of the basing action we are observing in the long-term cup formation above.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If a double bottom or a grind below $1,100 in gold must occur, it will only expand out the timeline of the basing formation, not change the overall pattern. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of the higher high in 2016 amidst a lessening rate of decline over the three years prior should not be underestimated (large red circle, above). This market is in the process of changing its trend after the 2011 – 2015 decline… it is only the precise gyrations that remain to be seen and navigated.</span>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My only concern with this analysis ignores the possibility that the rally from the Jan. 2016 low occurred in three waves, versus the "five" required for an impulse wave.  As a result, it's more likely this "3" represents wave "A" of an A-B-C upward correction of the downtrend underway since 2011, with wave "B" still underway.  Once complete, wave "C" should be another rally wave.  However, if wave "B" bottoms at a new low, then wave "C" will not exceed the high of wave "A".  In our view, it will take several more years to complete the correction that should set the stage for an impulse advance to new highs, though we are confident it will eventually occur.  Our short-term concern rests with the rally into January 2017; a typical topping month since the early 1970's.  Couple that with what seems to be excessive bullish attitudes and you have the ingredients for another short-term bloodbath.  Having said all that, I still think metals belong in EVERY portfolio, like homeowner's insurance.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>US Dollar &amp; Long Bond Update</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/02/27/us-dollar-long-bond-update/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar Index, which measures the US dollar versus a basket of foreign currencies, is still perched precariously just above the breakout point of its 2015-2016 consolidation. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Closing the week at 101.1, the dollar must remain above 99.5 on the Index in order to avoid an extremely-bearish reversal pattern, which is tentatively taking the shape of a Head &amp; Shoulders top formation (blue callouts).</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1361" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1a-1024x609.png" alt="US Dollar Index " width="840" height="500" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial surge in the dollar seen immediately following Trump’s presidential victory was accompanied by a sentiment which suggested the new administration would reverse trade deficits, boost growth, and cut the US national debt. Yet the sluggishness of the dollar’s advance in recent weeks suggests that the market is having second thoughts about this initial determination.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From a sentiment standpoint, a bearish outlook for the dollar seems to be a possibility few in the mainstream media are contemplating – and for that reason, it represents a compelling contrarian viewpoint.</span>
<h3><b>Euro Fears? The Contrarian Stance</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, reports regarding the possible breakup of the euro-zone <img class="wp-image-1362 alignright" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1.png" alt="Bankers prepare for eurozone break-up risk. Financial Times" width="365" height="333" />have reached almost a fever-pitch, following the UK’s decision to leave the EU last June and uncertainty regarding elections across mainland Europe in 2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems “everyone” knows the euro is set to disintegrate over the next few years – and for that reason, we believe the trade is extremely crowded. As contrarians, when everyone knows that something is set to happen, we must at least ask the question: “Is there not an alternate possibility?”</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1363" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2.png" alt="Euro zone break-up fears back on the table with Italy expected to reject reforms" width="304" height="311" />While the Euro-zone clearly has a unique set of political/economic problems and may need substantial reforms, we must consider the possibility that most of this “news” is already priced in the currency.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, the fact that most investors are convinced of the euro’s imminent collapse leads us to strongly favor the stance that the euro is set to begin a multi-year advance. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And if the euro is nearing the start of a significant advance, the dollar should act conversely. As the largest component of the Dollar Index above is the euro (at 57%), a rising euro will cause the dollar to fall.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All else being equal, a falling dollar will tend to cause more investors to seek protection in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not want to call the top in the dollar prematurely, i.e. before we see a breakdown below 99.5 on the Dollar Index. However, the US currency is acting significantly weaker than it “should” be acting, given the two-year consolidation is seen prior to the breakout. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Something is not right with the way the dollar is behaving technically. If it does not manifest immediately, our best assessment is that dollar weakness should become evident by 2018.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Bonds</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonds represent US dollars to be received in the future. We continue to suspect that a generational timeframe top has been put in on long-dated US bonds. Shown below is the price of the US 30-year bond. Recall that the price of bonds moves opposite to yields, and so a record-high price equates to record-low yields.</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1364" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/3.png" alt="The price of the US-30 year bond" width="1015" height="603" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From a technical standpoint, tops after long-term advances tend to be characterized by an orderly advance which then becomes disorderly. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/01/09/us-bond-bubble-cracking/">US bonds</a>, we had observed an unprecedented 36-year advance in price, defined by an orderly (magenta color) rising channel from 1980 – 2016. The advance in bonds then became disorderly, taking on characteristics of a parabolic blow-off, and breaking the upper trend boundary (shown in blue, above). The top saw a price of 175 on the 30-year bond, which corresponded to a record low yield of 2.1%.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the blow-off, we observed a quick 17% drop in bond prices in 2H 2016. Such a quick drop from an all-time high suggests an initial exhaustion sell-off after an unsustainable advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are not expecting a collapse in bond prices immediately; however, if the above analysis is to remain valid, the 30-year yield at 2.1% should not be matched again – perhaps ever again in our lifetimes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following 36 years of rising bond prices, it is equally fathomable that the bond market could see 36 years of falling prices, corresponding to 36-years of rising interest rates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors had become accustomed to buying bonds for safety over the last generation. Years of falling bond prices should represent an important component of the long-term thesis for precious metals, as some of that safety-seeking capital that in the past would flow to bonds will be diverted in the future toward gold.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The size of the US bond market alone is estimated to be near $12 trillion. Meanwhile, at $1,300 per ounce, all of the gold ever mined in the history of the world is valued at $6.6 trillion (and nearly 50% of that gold is held in jewelry, mostly in Asia). We can see that it would not take a huge percentage of capital to flow from bonds to gold to cause a major price acceleration in the precious metals. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Gold Analysis</strong>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> price fell for the second week in a row last week, down $25 or 2.1% from a week prior. The final print on the NY COMEX futures exchange was $1,201 as of Friday afternoon.

Minor support at $1,220 was lost this week, and we expect this area will act as short-term resistance on the next advance.

Further minor support should be seen at $1,180.

Unless you are a short-term trader (for which we encourage utmost caution in the current technical backdrop) we want to draw your attention away from these minor support levels and toward <strong>the primary converging pattern which must resolve itself by Q3 – Q4 of this year</strong>. That is: the converging of the 2011 – 2017 long-term downtrend (magenta color) and the new rising support line (royal blue) which began in 2015.

Short-term gyrations will take on less and less significance as the two primary trends converge and until one of the trends gives way. When two converging trends meet on a chart, one of them must necessarily break in favor of the other. The outcome typically results in a strong move in the direction of the breakout, as illustrated below by the green arrows.

Based on the trajectory of the trends now developing, this break in one direction or another will occur no later than November, as the trends reach an apex convergence. However, based on past years of observing these patterns, it is generally more likely that the pattern will resolve itself at least 2-3 months prior.

To gauge the likely outcome, we will be watching supporting indicators from silver, the mining sector, the broad commodity complex, and currency cross-pairs over the months ahead.

For the time being, we will be closely monitoring <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> action in the world’s historic store of wealth over the days immediately following this week’s Fed interest rate announcement, due Wednesday afternoon.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1434" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/a_gold.png" alt="gold-analysis-march-2017" width="1126" height="843" />

&nbsp;

<strong>Silver Analysis</strong>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver price</a> fell 4.6% or $0.82 cents for the week to close at $16.92 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.

Although the price has fallen below anticipated support near $17.25, the message of this market is of a retest of the broken primary declining (blue) channel. The breakout came five weeks ago (red callout), and it is common for retests of broken declining channels to occur at a lower price point than the original breakout, due to the fact that the channel is necessarily falling.

By falling rapidly for six out of the last seven trading days, silver has approached oversold status on the RSI indicator (top of chart), indicating a short-term bottom (at minimum) is due.

We expect <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> will be making a bounce from this channel retest, shown by the green callout, on the way to challenging resistance near $18.50 over the next month.

The downtrend breakout would be considered to have failed – a bearish sign that a deeper low is in store for the future – if prices fall more than $0.30 cents further and definitively re-enter the declining channel.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Although I find your analysis very interesting, it occurs to me that with the present manipulation of the silver market, market analysis based on trends has limited worth. Obviously, Silver has been held at a low price despite both its intrinsic value as a useful mineral in electronics, etc. and the rate at which it is being mined versus the falling supply. Do you predict a point at which supply needs will break the cycle of market manipulation and silver will return to the $50 prices that we have seen in the past?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Either you are looking for coin collecting, accounting bullion into your Precious Metals IRA or just securing your earnings against inflation, gold bullion coins have always been an excellent choice. This article will reveal the top 10 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best gold coins to buy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2017. From the Nation’s beloved Gold Eagles and Buffalos to top-selling foreign gold pieces, you will find the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best way to buy gold coins</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and make thoughtful investment decisions.</span>
<h2><b>Top 10 </b><b>Best Gold Coins to Invest to</b><b> in 2017:</b></h2>
<h3>1) American Eagle 1 oz. Gold Coin</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most highly anticipated coin of each year, the American Gold Eagle is a classic addition to your coin portfolio. This beautiful coin series has proved to be a symbol of the Nation’s greatest values of patriotism, freedom, and equality. It’s legendary Lady Liberty, and bald eagle design makes it an essential keepsake for any investor or collector and a highly liquid asset.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although its gold purity is only .9167, the American Eagle 1 oz. Gold Coin is the single exception approved to be included in a Precious Metals IRA. The US Mint also offers the coin in rolls and monster boxes, making it an excellent option for bulk investments. The</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-1-oz-gold-american-eagle-bu"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">BU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-w-1-oz-proof-gold-american-eagle-box-coa"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">proof coins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are already ready to be purchased in original mint packaging, as well as in certified cases from NGC and PCGS.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1683" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gold-American-Eagle-300x300.jpg" alt="Gold American Eagle" width="300" height="300" />
<h3>2) American Buffalo Gold Coin</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 also brings you the latest issue of the US’s first .9999 pure gold coin series, the</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-1-oz-gold-american-buffalo-bu"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">American Buffalo Gold Coin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This series has been introduced by the US Mint to compete with highly pure foreign gold coins, such as the Gold Britannia or the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf. However, this stunning coin became tremendously popular because it’s a rendition of the famous 1913 Buffalo Nickel.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It features on its obverse side the magnificent profile portrait of a Native American while on its reverse is depicted the majestic American Buffalo inspired by the Black Diamond Bison that lived in the Central Park Zoo in 1910. Its high fineness and beloved design make it a treasured addition for any investor or collector.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1673" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Buffalo-300x300.jpg" alt="American Buffalo" width="300" height="300" />
<h3>3) Canadian Maple Leaf 1 oz. Gold Coin</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">RCM’s beloved</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-1-oz-canadian-gold-maple-leaf-bu"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Canadian Maple Leaf 1 oz. Gold Coin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is another iconic coin on the bullion market and one of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best gold coins for investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its renowned maple leaf reverse design is a world-famous symbol of the Canadian historical heritage, and along with its .9999 gold purity makes this superb coin a must-have for any passionate numismatist and a great choice for IRA savings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Canadian Maple Leaf 1 oz. Gold Coin is also favored for its exclusive bullion security enhancements: the micro-engraved leaf privy mark with the last two digits of the mintage year, the radial lines light-diffracting background pattern, and the Bullion DNA anti-counterfeiting technology. Due to its high-tech innovative security features, this coin is basically impossible to be counterfeited, for which many investors chose it over other options. RCM also offers this fantastic coin with various privy marks, as well as in rolls and monster boxes.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1674" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Canadian-Maple-300x300.jpg" alt="Canadian Maple" width="300" height="300" />

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold is inching ever closer to a resolution of the primary converging pattern that we have been monitoring for the last six months. The resolution of this pattern is going to define the trajectory for the precious metals market into 2018, so it continues to deserve our foremost attention. We have supporting indicators from other markets, but we should always evaluate gold as a distinct entity. The price action over the last week has been encouraging, although not yet decisive. For the week, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> finished higher by 2.5% or $31, to close at $1,288 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX late Friday afternoon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two significant technical concerns at this juncture. Please reference the updated 18-month gold chart below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1697 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2011-2017-Downtrend-1-1024x767.png" alt="18-month gold chart" width="588" height="441" />
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold is once again immediately challenging the 2011 – 2017 long-term downtrend (magenta color), which has held prices lower throughout the entire multi-year decline. The exact figure we want to see exceeded and held on a weekly close is $1,290 per ounce to confirm this breakout.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The region between $1,310 and $1,337 represents “Trump Reversal Resistance.” This is the price zone that was tested on the evening of Trump’s presidential victory on November 9, before the $65 intraday reversal occurred in the early morning hours. This reversal lower occurred on the <b>highest single daily volume in gold trading history</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as can be seen from the red callout on the volume indicator above.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>High Volume Reversals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">High volume reversals are near-universally never exceeded on the first attempt to overcome them. The reason for this is the sheer number of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold </a>buyers who purchased futures contracts that day and are now underwater, and who then desire to sell at break-even when the price matches their entry level. Again, gold’s November 9 reversal saw the highest ever daily volume in gold trading history, and so barring an outbreak of major international war, </span><b>we place the odds of gold exceeding the $1,310 - $1,337 Trump Reversal Resistance at near-zero on its first attempt.</b>

Yes, international tensions are on the rise, as can be seen over the last two weeks with the United States retaliation against Syria; the US dropping the largest non-nuclear bomb ever detonated against ISIS in Afghanistan; continued saber-rattling between North Korea, China, and the US; and uncertainty regarding Russian support for Syria. Yet unless world superpowers are literally on the edge of World War III – an event we see as a low probability – the two technical resistance levels referenced above are the ones that will exert primary influence on the gold market here and now.
<h3><b>Early Indicator</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week we noticed early warning trend indicators coming from the gold mining complex. Note in the chart below how the senior gold miners index (HUI) has broken out through its similarly-shaped converging pattern (blue lines). At this juncture, it appears that the miners are hinting that strength is to be expected in gold bullion itself.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1698" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Breakhout-1024x766.png" alt="Breakhout in Large-Cap Gold Miners" width="565" height="422" />
<h3><b>Scenarios for Gold – Remainder of 2017</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The pending breakout pattern for gold will be important because the initial  target of the breakout is calculated to be equal to the 2016-2017 consolidation amplitude: roughly $330 ($1,378 - $1,045, rounded down). As gold’s consolidation reaches an apex at $1,205 (see far right, gold chart page 1), </span><b>the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/02/20/gold-targets-1300/">gold target</a> for a breakout is $1,535 within 6-12 months.</b>

The timing for gold’s next advance therefore depends on when it indeed breaks its long-term downtrend. Two scenarios are thus illustrated on the chart (page 1) above, highlighted in green and orange/red.

<b>Scenario A – </b><b>highlighted (page 1) in green:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short covering and/or geopolitical tensions result in a breaking of gold’s long-term downtrend above $1,290 within the next 2-4 weeks.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold’s short-term advance targets $1,320, as short sellers who were trapped between $1,200 and $1,260 cover en masse.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders holding futures contracts since November 9 (Trump’s victory reversal) exit positions between $1,310 - $1,337.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold stalls in the Trump Reversal Resistance zone and retreats to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its broken 2011 – 2017 long-term downtrend during Q2 above $1,260.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A successful retest of the broken trendline leads to the initial impulsive wave of the advance to target $1,535.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">(Readers may find the nature of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>’s retest of its broken second-half 2016 downtrend, discussed in recent articles, to be a helpful analogy for what we could expect for gold’s retest of its long-term downtrend, once broken.)</span>

<b>Scenario B – </b><b>highlighted (page 1) in orange</b><b>/</b><b>red</b><b>:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold fails to exceed its long-term downtrend within the next 2-3 weeks, and thus falls back to within the converging pennant consolidation.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support should be expected to emerge above the $1,180 - $1,200 support zones.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continued consolidative price action defines trading through mid-Q3 2017.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A resolution of the converging pennant must occur by Q3 – Q4 2017.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early technical indicators (HUI senior gold miners, gold/silver ratio) suggest this resolution will be higher. Target would remain $1,535.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;">Although a low probability, we must mention the downside risk. If the convergence resolves lower through a break of the 2015-2016 rising trendline (blue), gold would target $875 per ounce in 2018 ($1,205 convergence - $330 amplitude).</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold Prices</b></h3>
The next 2-3 trading weeks will set the trajectory for the remainder of 2017. A strong advance through the declining long-term downtrend sets the stage for a first challenge of the Trump Reversal Resistance zone, which should be followed by a retest of the broken line. We then expect a strong impulsive advance to target new highs for gold in 2018.

Conversely, a rejection at the long-term downtrend means gold must continue to consolidate within its primary converging pennant for Q2 – Q3. Early indicators suggest the eventual outcome will be higher, although a low-probability resolution to the downside must be monitored until proven otherwise.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the turbulence in the world political scene surrounding the French election, saber-rattling between the United States and North Korea, and uncertainty regarding Russian support for Syria, let us take the opportunity this week to update our perspective on gold as priced in major world currencies outside the US dollar. If <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/?p=1745&amp;preview=true">gold</a> was found to be violating important support levels across the globe, it would give us reason to question the trajectory for US dollar-priced gold at this juncture. Conversely, if gold as priced in foreign currencies remains strong, it would give us reason to anticipate that US dollar <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold</a> is set advance when we observe a breakout in the consolidation discussed last week.</span>
<h3><b>British Pound to US Dollar (GBP / USD)</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we examine gold as priced in British pound sterling, we should note that just last Monday the pound saw an important breakout versus the US dollar. Below we show the GBP / USD cross pair, from the final drop seen last October in the wake of  the Brexit vote, through present.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1746 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Triagle-Consolidation-breakout.png" alt="Triagle Consolidation breakout" width="527" height="371" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The breakout higher in GBP / USD occurred on Monday as the pound clearly exceeded the triangle consolidation (blue trendlines) above 1.255 which had formed following the terminal stages of the preceding decline.</span>

<b>This breakout signals a reversal higher in British pound sterling in the works.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The initial target for GBP / USD is calculated as 1.318, equal to the amplitude (0.083) of the preceding consolidation added to the apex (off chart, right) of the triangle, at 1.235. It remains to be seen if this reversal develops into a longer-term trend of strength for GBP / USD, but given our suspicion of a multi-year top forming in the US dollar itself, and that GBP represents 11.9% of the dollar index, this breakout should give an initial signal that dollar weakness is likely approaching.</span>

As the strongest periods for precious metals prices tend to correspond with the weakest periods in the US dollar, this breakout in GBP / USD bears monitoring.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[We note here that a reversal higher in GBP is occurring just at the depths of negative sentiment regarding the British pound. Most mainstream media outlets and investment channels have been expecting continued weakness in GBP. As markets so often do, the negative sentiment has already been priced into the current level, and the market has now reversed higher in the opposite direction as prevailing sentiment would seem to dictate.]</span>
<h3><b>Gold in GBP</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning to gold as priced in GBP, we see that the market still remains defined by the long-term rising linear trendline (magenta), which began in 2005. After breaking the 2011 – 2015 downtrend in a surge to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">£900 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in early 2016, gold then saw a follow-through surge above </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">£900 on the day following the historic Brexit vote.</span>

Note that following the climb to over £,050, gold then fell right back to £900 in December 2016, successfully retesting that breakout point.

Gold closed last week at £1,006.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot make short-term predictions about GBP-priced gold at this juncture, but the major point of this analysis is to determine if there are red flags as per the worldwide gold market that would give us warning signs as to US dollar-priced gold. We see no technical weakness from the long-term perspective in GBP-gold, and indeed this market looks set to re-challenge the £1,200 all-time high (set in 2011) on the next surge, likely within 12-24 months.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1747 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gold-in-British-Pounds-1024x609.png" alt="Gold in British Pounds" width="840" height="500" />
<h3><b>Gold in Euros (EUR)</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold as priced in the European common currency continues to look healthy for the continuation of a worldwide bull market, having closed the week at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">€1,202. We note the continuation of a similar long-term rising trend which began in 2005.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Euro-priced gold broke its 2011 – 2016 downtrend in early 2016, and the advance since then has featured a series of waves, the most recent of which clearly exceeded the prior peak of early 2015 (blue arrows). Lows continue to rise as well, the most recent low coming at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">€1,070 clearly higher than the early 2016 low of €970, itself clearly higher than the prior two lows of 2014 – 2015 (magenta arrows).</span>

We will want to see the rising long-term support line hold on any weakness in EUR-gold, just above €1,050. Based on the current trajectory, we can project that EUR-gold will retest its all-time high near €1,400 within the next 24-36 months, or slightly after GBP-gold.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1748 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gold-in-Euros-1024x609.png" alt="Gold in Euros" width="840" height="500" />
<h3><b>Gold in Australian Dollars (AUD)</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, although gold priced in Australian dollars has remained stronger on a percentage basis than any of the preceding currencies, AUD-gold is the only one to have broken its rising long-term trendline back in 2013. The old investment adage, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The steeper the trend, the less important the break,”</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">comes to mind here, as since that technical break, Australian dollar-priced gold has been the only gold cross pair of major world currencies to retest its all-time high of $1,850, which it did in mid-2016 (red callout arrows).</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1749 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gold-in-Australian-Dollars-1024x608.png" alt="Gold in Australian Dollars" width="840" height="499" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The consolidation taking place since 2011 has taken the distinct shape of a cup formation – and it is likely that the retracement back toward $1,550 in December 2016 represented the “handle” of a cup-and-handle technical formation. For reference, the textbook definition of the pattern is shown below (courtesy Investopedia.com):</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1750 size-medium" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AUD-December-2016-300x266.png" alt="AUD December 2016" width="300" height="266" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon a break of the $1,850 all-time high, the target for AUD-gold is calculated as $2,400, derived from adding the amplitude of the cup consolidation ($550) to the breakout point. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We continue to anticipate that a breakout to new all-time highs in AUD-gold, for those who monitor such signals, will serve as an early-warning to holders of gold in other major currencies that similar breakouts are pending.</span>
<h3><b>Gold in Canadian Dollars (CAD)</b></h3>
Gold as priced in the Canadian “loonie” is one of the most precise technical markets clearly visible on the charts. CAD-gold closed at $1,740 last week, a mere 8% below the all-time high of $1,900 set in 2011.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we show CAD-gold since 2002:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1751 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gold-in-Canadian-Dollars-1024x608.png" alt="Gold in Canadian Dollars" width="840" height="499" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distinctness of the rising long-term (magenta) trendline should leave no doubts as to its importance.</span>

The low for CAD-gold was in 2013, at $1,250 per ounce. This major low was confirmed by the breakout in late-2014 of the declining trendline since the 2011 all-time high (red callout).

Note the well-defined structure of the rising trend since the 2013 bottom: a series of distinct higher lows and higher highs. The most recent higher low came in December 2016 at just below $1,500.

Gold in Canadian dollars looks healthy from a long-term perspective, and we anticipate it may be the second major world currency, following Australian dollar-gold, to see a new all-time high above the 2011 mark.
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold in Foreign Currencies</b></h3>
We perform these periodic reviews of gold in foreign currencies to remain cognizant of what is happening across the international investment arena. As a precious metals investor in 2017, you are indeed part of a worldwide movement.

We see no major technical warnings across gold as priced in any of the major western currencies. Initial retests of all-time highs have either already occurred, or they are expected to occur within the next 24 months. Significant advances following lengthy consolidations should be expected upon successful breakouts of these all-time highs.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The strength seen in gold as priced in foreign currencies continues to give us confidence that the worst laggard of the group <strong><i>(</i></strong></span><b>yet the most important for the worldwide recognition of a new bull market) – gold in US dollars)</b> <b>–</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not far behind.</span>

		<title>Gold to Silver Ratio</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/05/01/gold-to-silver-ratio/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The gold to silver ratio (GSR), or the number of ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold, has not followed the timeline of the more aggressive move lower we were anticipating over the last several months. Instead, the ongoing consolidation between 65 – 74 on the ratio has moved toward the upper end of the range over the last few weeks, as <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> has remained steady above $1,260 yet <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver price</a> has fallen to the low $17 range again. </span>

Recall that a rising GSR tends to correspond with falling gold and silver prices, as was seen from 2011 to late 2015.

The final close on the GSR was 73.4 as of Friday afternoon.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1831 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Gold-to-Silver-Ratio-1024x609.png" alt="Gold to Silver Ratio" width="585" height="348" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the most important facet of the above chart is to note that the ratio remains healthfully below the 2011 – 2016 broken rising trend channel (turquoise lines). This breakdown has held for over a year. It would be rare for such a breakdown to reverse and make new highs during the current cycle.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the breaking of this clearly-defined trend channel which alerted us to the changing nature of the precious metals market in early 2016. Although the ratio has not moved lower in favor of silver for the last few months, it remains within the confines of an initial consolidation after the multi-year breakdown. Currently the ratio is facing significant resistance at the 74 level.</span>
<h3><b>Silver to Catch Up</b></h3>
Confirming evidence for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> to play catch up can be seen from a study of the momentum of the ratio’s recent advance, which has reached the highest reading since late February, 2016. The following chart contains the last two years of the GSR, with the momentum indicator (RSI) on top, the GSR immediately below, followed by the price of gold, and then the price of silver, all plotted along the same timescale. Let us examine it closely:
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time the RSI momentum indicator reached above 70 was in February 2016, when <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> had advanced to nearly $1,260, clearly exceeding the previous peak from 2015 at $1,190.  Even so, at that moment silver was “stuck” at $14.75, failing to eclipse its relative 2015 peak of $16.25.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We should recall this early-2016 episode carefully. </span><b>Many analysts at the time asserted that the move in gold was suspect, because silver was not “confirming” gold’s advance each day.</b>

We strongly disagreed at the time, and felt that other technical indicators were confirming a more significant advance to come in both metals. The lag in the move higher for silver was typical of an early-cycle advance in the sector.

<strong>What we can see at right is:</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time the GSR momentum RSI (top of chart) reached 70 this marked the absolute high in the ratio, February 2016.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright wp-image-1832 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Broken-2011-2015-Gold-SIlver-Ratio-Uptrend-203x300.png" alt="Broken 2011-2015 Gold SIlver Ratio Uptrend" width="276" height="408" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">February 2016 also marked a mid-point consolidation in gold after a strong advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver lagged gold’s advance, only to play catch-up over the next four months.</span>

The takeaway is that silver does not need to confirm gold’s move across every timeframe. Silver can lag for weeks, months, or even years in certain instances, and this does not negate the validity of gold, nor the eventual catch-up effect that is to be witnessed in silver itself.
<h3><b>2008 – 2011 Example</b></h3>
Consider an example from the last precious metals advancing cycle. Gold had peaked in March 2008 at $1,033 per ounce, while silver peaked at the same time at $21.50. After the crash of 2008-2009, gold regained its losses and went on to advance to several new all-time highs into 2010, first above $1,033, then above $1,100, and finally above $1,250.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All the while, silver remained below its 2008 peak of $21.50.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was certainly frustrating for silver investors over at least a 12-month period.</span>

<b>GSR with prices of gold &amp; silver: 2008 - 2010</b>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1833 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2008-Gold-to-Silver-Ratio-update.png" alt="2008 Gold to Silver Ratio update" width="435" height="642" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, was gold’s advance suspect because silver was not confirming it? </span>Or, was this an opportunity to accumulate silver, before the period of catch-up? The following extended version of the above chart will tell:

<b>GSR with prices of gold &amp; silver: 2008 - 2011</b>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1834 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Gold-to-Silver-Ratio-4.png" alt="Gold to Silver Ratio " width="419" height="618" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that the black vertical line shows the ending of the preceding chart. From that point in mid-2010, silver then advanced 180% toward its 2011 peak while gold advanced 25% over the same timeframe.</span>

The major point of this analysis is to be wary of analysts who claim that silver must confirm gold’s moves across every time period. As silver investors, we must be prepared to watch gold lead sometimes for weeks, months, or years. Other technical indicators must be used to determine whether or not we are in a primary advancing cycle in the precious metals. It is not sufficient to simply watch silver lag and label the move suspect.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The present opportunity looks ripe for silver to begin playing catch up over the near-term, even if there are further periods of lag to come as the metals advance through 2018. </span>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold price</a> fell $41 from a week prior to close at $1,227 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon. This represents a 3.3% drop from the close a week prior.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A bounce is due, but we clearly see that the gold market wishes to consolidate further over the short-run. </span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1867 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2011-2017-Downtrend-1024x766.png" alt="2011-2017 Downtrend" width="549" height="411" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of the pennant consolidation breakout that must necessarily occur by Q3 – Q4 is not lessened by the consolidation that is underway – in fact, it is only strengthened in its eventual resolution. The more time that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> remains within the context of the consolidation defined by the falling long-term downtrend (magenta color) and the rising blue support, the stronger the breakout that will happen when this pattern is resolved. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Short-term traders are cautioned that volatility and thus opportunity for profit should subside as the consolidation progresses this summer and into Q3. The definition of a converging pennant consolidation is volatility that lessens as buyers and sellers each exhaust one another. The pending new market trend occurs because the next influx of large buyers or sellers is met by exhausted existing participants.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The boundaries of gold’s consolidation now come in at:</span>

<b>Upper boundary: $1,290 and falling.</b>

<b>Lower boundary: $1,155 and rising.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, over the short-run, we anticipate gold is due for a bounce, likely back to the $1,240 - $1,260 region, before consolidation continues through this summer, the technical action for which will be less meaningful within the above ranges until Q3. </span>Our 12-month target upon a breakout remains significantly above or below the $1,205 apex of the consolidation – $1,535 or $875 –  dependent on the direction of the breakout. This target is derived from taking widest amplitude ($330) of the converging consolidation and adding it to the apex of the pattern.
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fed Meeting</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/05/03/daily-market-review-may-3/">The Federal Reserve meeting</a> last week resulted in no change to the US central bank’s short-term interest rate target. The Fed funds rate remains at generationally-low levels, at a range of 0.75% - 1.00%.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The language accompanying the Fed non-decision is being closely securitized by the market:</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Committee views the slowing in growth during the first quarter as likely to be transitory and continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Translated from Fed-speak, this moderately-positive outlook suggests that the Fed will look to raise interest rates at its next meeting, on June 14.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We remind new readers that – contrary to the faulty-logic repeated in most mainstream media outlets – rising interest rates have most closely corresponded with rising precious metals prices throughout history.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, since the first interest rate hike in almost a decade in December</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img class="alignright wp-image-1868" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/US-3-Month-Treasury-Yields.png" alt="US 3-Month Treasury Yields" width="393" height="407" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">2015, each of the following hikes have been met by higher lows forming in the gold price:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>First Fed rate hike – December 2015</strong> – gold: $1,045.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Second Fed rate hike – December 2016</strong> – gold: $1,122.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Third Fed rate hike – March 2017</strong> – gold: $1,198.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our own proprietary technical model, which relies on 3-month Treasury yields as a leading indicator, indeed suggests that a fourth Fed rate hike is pending. At right we show the 3-month yields on top, with the price of gold immediately below, since 2015. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note how US 3-month yields have spiked several weeks in advance of each of the first three rate hikes. Essentially the Fed is responding in policy to higher yields in the short-term Treasury market.</span>

<b>The important point is that the rate announcements have almost exactly corresponded with major lows in the price of gold.</b>

<b>Gold Traders Have Been Wrong Three Times…</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At some point, we should expect gold futures traders – who have gotten this trade wrong on each of the prior three Fed rate hikes by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">selling in anticipation of the rate increase</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (only to see gold rise strongly against them after the announcement) – will wake up and cease this losing strategy. Thus, likely this year, gold may be expected to form its next intermediate low weeks in advance of the Fed announcement as traders wise up.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The futures market is also pricing in a fourth rate hike, as can be seen below by the 83.1% odds that traders are assigning to the pending outcome:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1865 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Target-rate.png" alt="Target rate" width="501" height="442" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Any gold price low above $1,198 on a fourth Fed rate hike would thus keep the trend of higher lows intact on the first four rate hikes since 2007. In a market that may be commencing a period of several years of additional Fed hikes, this trend bears continual monitoring.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">To review the primary operating motive of this series of articles: there are hundreds of fundamental factors driving the precious metals markets (currency debasement, potential stock market declines, geopolitical instability, jewelry demand, and industrial fabrication being the major ones). However, no one can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ever</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> know the sum of all fundamental factors impacting a market. To attempt to do so would require complete knowledge of all the factors impacting of each and every single participant in the international market. Such is an impossibility.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the one place in which every market participant comes together – no matter what his or her specific fundamental belief – is in the decision to buy or sell at a specific price point. Price is where the sum of all market participants converge.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, by studying price foremost, we can observe what is actually happening in the market by filtering out the ‘noise’ that so often accompanies fundamental-only analysis. And by observing trends in price – the sum of the buyers and sellers – we can align ourselves with the strongest ones in an attempt to profit.</span>
<h3><strong>Silver Price Update</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us take a good look at silver this week. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver price</a> finished higher last week by $0.13 cents to close at $16.40 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon, a gain of 0.8%.  </span>On the very short-term, the RSI momentum indicator (top of chart), which had registered the most oversold reading since the 2015 bottom, correctly gave us a warning of this bounce that is underway.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1903 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Silver-most-oversold-since-2015-bottom-1024x767.png" alt="Silver-most oversold since 2015 bottom" width="555" height="416" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The question of how far this advance continues remains to be seen. We would like to see <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> regain its broken rising linear trendline (dashed blue), by maintaining a weekly close above $16.50. Such would register the recent break as a “false breakdown” at the most-oversold reading in nearly two years, which would solidify this low as an important medium-term bottom.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if $16.50 fails to be regained again over the next two weeks and silver tops out below the broken trendline, we will consider this a sign of caution. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A sign of caution does not mean we negate the entire thesis for a Q3 – Q4 breakout in the metals. It would suggest, however, that silver could continue to lag throughout the initial stages of gold’s advance, perhaps failing to exceed its 2016 high ($21.25 ) within the same immediate time as when <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> finally exceeds its relative $1,378 peak. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Support lines between $16.75 - $17.25 has been removed from the silver chart above from the version from several weeks ago because, after serving as an important magnet for prices on four successive junctures from last October through the previous week, the zone failed to hold during the most recent decline. For whatever reason, a new group of sellers have shown up and/or buyers did not appear within that range as we had observed them previously, and so we must adjust our perspective and outlook accordingly.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the positive side, because this level is no longer a support zone, it will also no longer be a resistance level as silver moves higher. Sellers should be largely absent within this region.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is little in the way of resistance until $17.75, which becomes our target on a recapturing of the broken blue trendline at $16.50. This was the pivot low from the April correction.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the long-run, we have targets much higher than $17.75. However, over the short run this should serve as short-term resistance. </span>Silver must at minimum consolidate above Important Support labeled at $15.75 to keep the bull market thesis intact during the remainder of 2017. A break below this level would signal a major red flag for gold and cause us to have to rework the 2017 – 2020 long-term model.
<h3><b>SLW / SLV Ratio</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We often use the ratio between large-cap silver miners and silver bullion itself to gauge short-term pivot points in the metals. Silver Wheaton (SLW) is our large-cap miner of choice, a sector leader across most timeframes. Below we update the chart, with SLW on top and SLV (silver bullion proxy) immediately below. Note that SLW now is firmly within the 2017 mid-consolidation (above the green support band), while silver itself is well below its correlated price zone. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, SLW often discounts short-term price movements that will not last in the underlying silver market.</span>
<p class="aligncenter"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1904 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SLW-well-above-March-lows.png" alt="SLW well above March lows" width="440" height="456" /></p>
<p class="aligncenter"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This leading indicator is calling for a continued recovery in silver over the intermediate-term, although please note that this signal can sometimes occur early, i.e. immediate weakness in silver can occur for the first few days, and then the recovery begins. Those looking to do short-term trading in silver should use other confirming technical indicators such as momentum and trendlines analysis.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> closed higher by $14 or 1.2% to finish at $1,268 for the week. The precious metal is now close enough to its key long-term 2011-2017 downtrend that we can again call this advance another attempt to overcome the critical level. The last attempt to do so came on April 17 at $1,290 per ounce – a level which was exceeded for a few hours before failing to hold it throughout the overnight trading hours. As the trendline is downward sloping, the level to overcome inherently is falling every week, and we thus shift our focus to the $1,280 level, as shown below by the most recent arrow just above that long-term (magenta color) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trendline.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2004 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Gold-2008-Present-1024x766.png" alt="Gold 2008-Present" width="840" height="628" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have stated in the past that our target upon a successful breakout of the pennant-shaped consolidation will be $330 above or below the apex of the consolidation, which is $1,205: thus, either $1,535 or $875, within 6-12 months of the breaking point. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will have much more analysis on what short-term swings to expect </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">within</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this significant movement once the break of the pattern finally happens. For now, let us continue to focus on the pattern’s resolution itself, and the $1,280 figure that would be required at this juncture.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2005 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2011-2017-Downtrend-1-1024x766.png" alt="2011-2017 Downtrend" width="840" height="628" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most probable scenario we see is that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> again fails to break out this week, and continues to grind in the low-mid $1,200’s through Q3, in what should be the final exhaustive consolidation to wear out the last remnants of the “hot money” that became interested in the sector only after 2016’s first-half surge.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, at our firm we are already largely invested, and that is because in a bull market surprises should be expected to the upside, i.e. a breakout sooner – perhaps by mid-summer – rather than later in the year. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While in the midst of a lengthy consolidation it is difficult to imagine that anything else will ever occur. Frustration grows as the sector oscillates without much definitive movement. This is exactly the time to go against the herd and not succumb to such limited perspective.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The price action that occurs after a consolidation breaks will have little resemblance to the price action within the consolidation itself. This is one of the clearest consolidation patterns we have ever observed in the gold market. Let us remain alert.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The technical action in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> is encouraging for the entire sector. Gold’s cousin rose $0.53 cents or 3.1%, to close at $17.32 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday. Having regained the rising trendline successfully, we can now call the final portion of silver’s plunge into early May below $16.50 a “false breakdown” as can be seen on the chart.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2007 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Silver-oversold-1024x766.png" alt="Silver oversold" width="840" height="628" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is minor resistance at $17.75 which may halt the current advance – although if and when gold breaks its primary consolidation, silver should rise with strength such that it may simply ignore most of the previous short-term resistance levels that are visible on the chart above. On a successful gold breakout, momentum indicators and/or leading signals from the silver mining complex will be more important for gauging the next target of an intermediate high.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To the downside, we would see a break of support at $15.75 as a major red flag that the expected bull market advance may be delayed beyond 2018.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Longer-term, however, the clarity of silver’s basing pattern could not be more apparent. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver prices</a> are now beginning their fifth year below the $25/oz region. Downward momentum is largely exhausted after the 73% drop from 2011 – 2015. The longer that prices remain in this basing pattern, the stronger that the move higher will eventually be once $25 is breached. We must remember that at each swing higher and lower within a basing pattern, metal is being transferred from weak hands to strong.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our general expectation is that silver may continue with this basing process with an upward bias through mid-2018.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2008 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Silver-2011-2017-1-1024x925.png" alt="Silver 2011-2017" width="840" height="759" />

		<title>The US Bond Market – the 800-Pound Gorilla</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The “800-pound gorilla” in the investment world is not the US stock market, nor yet the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> market – it is the US treasury bond market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US bond market, at over $40 trillion in value, is much larger than the US stock market, which comes in at a little over $25 trillion. The longest-dated component of the US treasury market is the 30-year bond.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The chart below shows the price of the US 30-year bond from 1980 through the present. Readers should recall that interest rates move inversely to price – so as the price has been rising steadily for the past 36 years, interest rates have been falling this entire time, to a generational low of 2.1% last summer.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2079 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/US-30-Year-Bond-Price-1024x609.png" alt="US 30-Year Bond Price" width="578" height="344" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we can see, investors have had an insatiable appetite for US debt over the past 36 years. We here see a market which was following a long-term orderly rising channel, which then started to take on characteristics of a mania from 2015 – 2016. During these recent years, bond prices began a parabolic curve higher (blue callout), corresponding to a willingness by investors to accept negative real returns for the privilege of holding US debt. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The textbook footprint of a mania on a chart is a long-term orderly market breaking higher into a parabolic curve. This is exactly what was witnessed from 2014 through mid-2016 in the longest-dated US bond.</span>
<h3><b>Parabolic Curve Broken</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The parabolic curve was then broken in last summer’s decline in bond prices, indicating a long-term top was put into place. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet bonds are once again in the media for having had several positive months in a row, as we can see below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2080 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Treasury-Bond-Price.png" alt="Treasury Bond Price" width="704" height="468" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If our analysis is correct, </span><b>any rally in bond prices from this point onward should be counter-trend in nature only</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Last summer’s highs at 175 should not be regained for bond prices. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will have strong confirmation within the next six months if bond prices make a new low below 145. Much stronger confirmation will come from a breakdown below the lower rising channel line (magenta color) near 135, which would be expected at any time within the next 12-36 months.</span>
<h3><b>Bond Market Critical to US &amp; Western Standard of Living</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The one backdrop which most investors alive today have known is rising bond prices and the corresponding falling interest rates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us assume that the average American begins to follow the financial markets and to consider investing at age 22. This means that anyone born after 1958 knows only falling interest rates as a broad macroeconomic backdrop.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every political and technological advance that has happened in the US and allied western nations since 1980 has occurred amidst falling interest rates and ever-cheaper credit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, total debt in the United States exceeded gross domestic product for the first time in 2011, a trend which does not appear to be improving:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2081 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FRED-1024x342.png" alt="FRED" width="840" height="281" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This imbalance can only happen amidst a backdrop of investors willing to ever finance US debt by continuously purchasing US-bonds. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet on the 36-year chart above, we show what appears to be the key characteristics of a market in the process of putting in a long-term top.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How will the United States finance this debt amidst a rising interest rate backdrop? The interest expense for federal debt alone in 2016 was $432 billion. Can we imagine if interest rates double just too historic norms that existed ten years ago? With the addition of record new debt this year, the annual interest rate expense alone could easily exceed $1 trillion within the next 3 years.</span>

<b>How will the United States fund an interest expense growing exponentially if the bond market has put in a long-term top?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, no politician wins re-election in a democracy by cutting funding to constituents.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No one stays in office for long by cutting benefits to the sick, the elderly, the poor, veterans, schools, or for infrastructure. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, the solution to the funding gap is: the Federal Reserve will be forced to print money.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The central bank will be forced to create sufficient money to “monetize” US bonds to cover whatever cannot be raised by taxes alone.</span>
<h3><b>Monetization of Debt is Inflation</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Monetization is the direct creation of new money to finance debt – and it will represent a hidden tax on those least able to afford it, namely the poor and middle-class on fixed incomes. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When inflation drives up the prices of necessities such as food and shelter, these classes have no means to protect themselves, as they are forced to buy those items no matter the cost. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, those with disposable income can protect themselves and even benefit from periods of inflation if they invest properly by owning real assets. For this reason, inflation is a regressive tax, in that it steals quality of life from the poor and gives to the rich.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the policy of most Western governments and central banks today.</span>
<h3><b>Back to the Bond Market</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, we come back to the bond market. The theoretical fundamentals of a declining bond market have been hypothesized by various writers for many decades… yet it is only now that we are seeing actual topping signals on the chart itself.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it possible that the parabolic curve seen on the chart above was simply a warmup for an even more manic final blow-off to come? Ultimately anything is possible in the markets. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But if that is going to happen, we will see it on the chart very soon, as bond prices should explode higher and clearly exceed the 175 level for 6-18 months before they come crashing down. Fundamentally, this could only correspond with real interest rates plunging into the negative 2-3% range, as investors would “pay” the government for the privilege of loaning money to them.</span>

<b>Our best assessment is that the top has already occurred. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A parabolic curve in the largest bond market in the world that exceeded the 36-year rising channel has already broken down. It would be rare to see this curve regained again.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> investors, this market bears our foremost attention over the next year. We should be able to plainly see a breakdown of the long-term rising channel on the chart when it occurs. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This will be a sign of a multi-decade top in no uncertain terms. Decades of rising interest rates should follow… and amidst a backdrop of a government caught between a rock (unfunded debt) and a hard place (printing money), we know that in the fiat era a government will always choose the later.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term thesis for protection by precious metals ownership is thus still in its infancy. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The failed breakout and reversal back below the long-term declining trendline at $1,280 for gold this past week is a negative development for the entire precious metals complex. From a technical standpoint, it is exactly what we did not want to see as far as a market ready for a major advance.

Even so, we must quantify the nature of a false breakout. Those failed moves that happen at the end of multi-year or multi-decade advances (as we have recently seen in the US dollar) tend to be leading signals of long-term trend reversals. The <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold market</a> at $1,280 per ounce is nowhere near the all-time high from 2011 at $1,923. So inherently this failed advance cannot carry the same weight as a long-term top.

Still, the reversal could carry the consequence of a significant intermediate-term decline. By failing to sustain the advance above this same trendline once again, gold remains in a negative posture for the time being, until proven otherwise.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2116" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/a_gold-2011-2017-downtrend.png" alt="gold-2011-2017-downtrend" width="1099" height="823" />

&nbsp;

For the week as a sum, gold fell 0.9% or $12 to close at $1,266 as of the final trade in the electronic access market in New York on Friday afternoon.

Gold’s next initial support comes in at $1,230, which is the rising (dashed) trendline visible on the chart from the January low.
<h2><strong>Beware Early Celebrators</strong></h2>
We have been making the case over the last year that many technical-based traders would be waiting for this pending breakout signal to begin buying, as clear long-term trendlines are visible to many who follow such charts.

However, on Tuesday when we first saw the breakout attempt, we noted the necessity for the advance to <u>hold</u> the $1,280 level at least through this week’s Fed meeting on Wednesday. Also on Tuesday, we observed many premature celebrations throughout the investment world regarding gold’s breakout.

Long-term breakouts must have both conviction and sustaining power. From a contrarian standpoint, the lack of caution by so many investors, including mainstream media outlets such as Bloomberg and well-known commodity analysts, was a bearish setup for the sharp reversal seen the following day. Below are just a few samples:

<strong> </strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2117" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/b_gold-long-term-breakouts-yearly.png" alt="Long-term breakouts" width="942" height="791" />
<h2><strong>Gold’s Next Support</strong></h2>
The consolidation pattern continues to get tighter, and a big move is coming in one direction or the other. Gold could still find support above $1,230 and then stage a legitimate breakout in July or early August. But a failure at the $1,230 rising support would trigger a short-term topping formation, which would target $1,140 initially, and open the door to a retest of the 2015 bottom at $1,045.

We do not want to get too far ahead of ourselves at this juncture, except to say that gold remains in an inherently neutral consolidation following this false breakout. The bearish resolution would result in either a retest of the 2015 bottom at $1,045 or even a new low, while the bullish resolution would result in a significant leg higher across the entire <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com">precious metals</a> complex targeting $1,535 within 6-12 months. Fundamental drivers will be causing these moves, but we will be able to observe the signals on the charts before any attributable news is announced publicly.

It is not easy to stay involved at the beginning of a suspected bull market for a reason – whiplash is the term for the price action we are observing and the unease it causes investors.

Was the entirety of the gain in 2016 just a big false start, before <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> heads for a new low? We cannot know until the above pattern is resolved.

The bottom line is short-term risk has grown based on the this week’s failure. However, the book is not yet written.
<h2><strong>Fed Meeting On Tap</strong></h2>
This Wednesday is the Federal Reserve interest rate meeting, where the Fed is expected to raise rates for the fourth time since December 2015.

Expect lower volatility trading on Monday and Tuesday, with high volatility immediately after the meeting announcement at 2pm, especially if the markets are at all surprised by the Fed decision. For reference, the market is expecting a single rate hike, with language hinting of a further 0.25% hike to come either in July or September, so anything other than this outcome could cause a high-volatility reaction through the rest of the week.

Next week we will examine the Fed policy statement and the impact it has on the precious metals.

		<title>Fed Rate Hike and Gold</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/06/19/fed-rate-hike-and-gold/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve increased short-term interest rates on Wednesday by 0.25%, the fourth rate hike of the current cycle which began in December 2015. Short-term rates now stand at 1.00% - 1.25%, which are still generally - low levels, yet now a full point higher than they were 18-months ago.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The key from the Fed meeting on Wednesday was not simply the interest rate decision, but the language given in the accompanying statement regarding a potential reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet: “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Committee currently expects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated. This program… would gradually reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings by decreasing reinvestment of principal payments from those securities.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall that an expansion of the balance sheet is a euphemism for printing money, which is inflation. Thus, a normalization would imply a reduction in the money supply and a reduction in inflation.</span>
<h3><b>Will the Fed Normalize?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are extremely skeptical that the Fed will engage in any meaningful reduction in its balance sheet, mostly due to the central bank’s horrible record in doing so at any point in the past. Below is the Fed’s balance sheet over the last 15 years. Indeed, it is rare that the bank stops printing money for more than a few quarters at a time, its balance sheet having grown by nearly 500% during this time: </span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2138 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FRED-1-1024x394.png" alt="All Federal Reserve Banks" width="840" height="323" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking forward, a survey of Fed board members is now pricing in either 0-1 additional rate hikes in 2017, followed by 3-4 hikes in 2018, followed by 2 further hikes in 2019, as shown in the graph below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2139 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FOMC-Member-Forecasts.png" alt="FED Member Forecasts" width="505" height="353" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold price</a> fell sharply following the Fed meeting, giving up $20 on Wednesday afternoon, not so much because of the rate increase, but because of the language regarding balance sheet normalization.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether or not the Federal Reserve will actually reduce its balance sheet, the market believes that it will, and over the short run, this is seen as gold-negative.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the week in sum, gold ended lower by $15 or 1.2% to close at $1,254 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Viewed in isolation, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> remains in its neutral consolidation pattern. Short-term support should exist at $1,230 (rising dashed trendline), and the nature of any rebound that occurs at this level will tell us much about what to expect over the remainder of the year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The more critical 2015 – 2017 support (blue line) – which is rising every week – now comes in at $1,160.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2140 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2011-2017-Downtrend-1024x767.png" alt="2011-2017 Downtrend" width="557" height="417" />
<h3><b>Gold Has Formed Higher Lows on Successive Rate Hikes</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast to the theory often purported in the mainstream media that rising interest rates are negative for gold, the precious metal has formed a series of higher lows within one week of each of the Fed rate hike announcements, shown below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2141 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Gold.png" alt="Gold " width="1145" height="499" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Will last week’s announcement thus mark a fourth higher low forming in gold again? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Time will tell.</span>

		<title>Gold vs. Commodities</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have seen weakness in the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> over the past two weeks, and if gold fails to break higher from its ongoing consolidation over the next 3-6 months, a significant culprit will selling amongst broad-based commodity funds. Below we zoom in on a detail of the CRB Commodity Index, which gold measures an average price level of 19 commodities including <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/coins">silver</a>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum/coins">platinum</a>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium/coins">palladium</a>, the industrial metals, the energy complex, and agricultural products.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that the CRB index has recently broken below its 15-month support zone between 176 – 179, which had held since April 2016.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2174 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CRB-1024x767.png" alt="CRB Commodity" width="840" height="629" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our technical target for the CRB over the short run is 158 on the index – in other words, a retest of the 2016 lows. This target is calculated by subtracting the amplitude of the failed advance above the support zone (19) from the breakdown point (177). Fundamentally, it represents an equal number of long contract holders who are likely to liquidate below the breakdown point as who bought above the support zone over the past year.</span>
<h3><b>Gold Sometimes Grouped with Other Commodities</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although gold is certainly not simply another commodity like the rest of the CRB index, during times in which investor psychology is preoccupied with “hot” markets such as technology stocks (Amazon, Facebook, etc.), real estate, and crypto-currencies, sentiment tends to fade against all commodities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We might disagree with the market fundamentally, i.e. we know currency debasement and unsustainable debt continues to increase every day, but a key point of our philosophy is to put our own fundamental opinion second, and to respect the market first.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At present, the market is seeing less of a need for safety due to a focus on hot risky asset classes, and so that component of gold demand is absent. We are thus witnessing gold and silver have a high correlation with the rest of the commodity complex. In such an environment, when institutional funds place sells orders for their diversified commodity holdings, gold is dumped in tandem with the group.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, gold has been outpacing the rest of the commodity complex since the late 2015 lows. However, such relative strength is not always sufficient to stop precious metals from falling in a general commodity liquidation over the short run. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If we see gold break down below $1,230, a key short-term support level, a continued decline in the CRB index will be a major contributing factor.</span>
<h3><b>Commodity Index Long-Term</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we back out the chart for the CRB index from 1974 – 2017:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2175 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CRB-Commodity.png" alt="CRB Commodity" width="1019" height="763" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be noted that </span><b>broad <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/02/06/gold-silver-commodities/">commodities</a> are now the cheapest they have been in 43 years nominally</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and by far the cheapest in real terms (adjusted for inflation). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The low of 2016 is in the process of being retested, which is what may lead to near-term weakness in gold – but in viewing the chart above we must seriously ask the question: how much lower can commodities fall from 43-year lows?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are tangible materials of finite supply in the earth’s crust, which the ever-growing world population consumes every day – a reality that will not change in our lifetimes unless technology to harvest minerals from asteroids arrives soon, a scenario still the realm of science fiction works.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The CRB Commodity Index cannot go to zero as a currency or individual stock can, yet this is the lowest that commodities have been in four decades. <b>When things that cannot go to zero are priced at their lowest in over a generation, we must view the relative risk/reward proposition as favorable from a long-term perspective.</b> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our assessment is that even if moderate weakness continues for several months to 1-2 years, broad commodities are much closer to a long-term bottom than a top. <img class="alignright wp-image-2176 size-medium" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Cycle-300x155.png" alt="The relative risk" width="300" height="155" /></span>

<b>Commodity Cycles</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Commodities are cyclical in nature. The chart at right shows the three major cycles that the commodity complex has seen since the 1970’s, divided into two sub-phases each of boom and bust cycles (green and red shading, respectively). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Booms and busts are an inherent feature of the typical 10-20 year delay that it takes for the mining lifecycle to move from:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a) mineral discovery through </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(b) mine permitting to </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(c) construction to </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(d) successful production which then</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(e) increases supply in the market. </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is said that in commodities “low prices are the solution for low prices”, as marginal mine supply is eliminated when prices fall, eventually forcing prices higher again. We are seeing this phenomenon already in many junior oil and precious metals companies: deposits which were once economic are no longer at today’s low commodity prices, and thus the mines are placed on care and maintenance, reducing supply until higher prices emerge.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Commodities in Relation to Gold</b></h3>
Even if weakness continues in the commodity complex through the remainder of this year, our assessment is that most commodities are much closer to long-term bottoms than long-term tops. Of course, each commodity will move at different times and with a different set of fundamentals. Yet the macro analysis shows a world preoccupied at the moment with the bull markets in digital technology – but as day must follow night, higher commodity prices must follow a period of lower prices. Gold selling due to broad commodity weakness is thus limited in the big picture, even if weakness over the short run cannot be ruled out.

		<title>Gold – A Large Move is Approaching</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">On a semi-regular basis, we find it helpful to revisit the longer-term perspective for the precious metals, so that short-term price action does not dominate our focus. This will be important shortly as, despite what may seem like a volatile market over the past few months, </span><b>we have reason to believe that the volatility in the gold market is set to increase massively throughout the second half of 2017 and into 2018</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> is in the process of forming a long-term bottom, but the challenge is that long-term bottoms often feature prices which can see a series of retests and/or nominal new lows throughout a multi-year basing period. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 20-year <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold chart</a> below, we see a confluence of four major technical support levels between the $850/ounce and $1,045/ounce levels. Whenever there is a confluence of technical targets within a certain price band, it represents a high-confidence level for a major low to form. While the following zone is too wide for short-term traders, it should give a reliable long-term support target for investors with a multi-year time horizon.</span>

<strong> The levels are labeled below:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2008 – 2015 horizontal support at $1,045.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term rising linear trendline which started in 2001, now at $900.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the entire 2000 – 2011 advance, which comes at $890.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former 1980 all-time closing high, which comes at $850.</span></li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2200 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Gold-2008-2015-P1.png" alt="Gold 2008-2015 P1" width="1125" height="495" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains possible that the absolute low for gold was formed in December 2015 at $1,045, but the likelihood of a retest of that level and/or nominal new lows is still significant. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A break of gold’s long-term declining 2011 – 2017 downtrend would give us increased confidence that the absolute low has already been formed, but this key <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/04/17/gold-breakout-approaching/">technical breakout</a> has remained elusive despite multiple attempts over the previous year.</span>
<h3><b>Gold Short-Term</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Zooming into the 18-month view, gold is extremely “tight” on the short-term chart, caught between its falling long-term downtrend (magenta) and its short-term rising trend from January (dashed teal color). These two trends are converging within the next six weeks, and when this happens one must necessarily break. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The immediate area of concern is highlighted below in green:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2201 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Gold-2011-2017-Downtrend-P2-1024x767.png" alt="Gold 2011-2017 Downtrend P2" width="840" height="629" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A break lower from this short-term green triangle opens up an initial decline to the $1,160 level in Q3, corresponding with the rising blue trend forming the lower boundary of the pennant-shaped consolidation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a break higher would be an important signal of a market set to start a new multi-year advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We truly are approaching a crossroads for the precious metal on the short-term chart.</span>

<b>Volatility Confirms Significant Move Ahead</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That a large price move is coming for gold can also be seen by examining volatility. Below is an index which trades on the Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE), which tracks the daily volatility of gold futures contracts. The index is shown since 2010:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2202 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GVZ-Gold-Volatility-P3.png" alt="GVZ Gold Volatility P3" width="878" height="437" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we can see, gold volatility is now at 8-year lows. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility is inherently a neutral market expression – in other words when volatility is low, it only tells us that a period of higher volatility is set to follow. However, it does not tell us in which direction the strong movement will occur.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The CBOE volatility index is confirming that either a surge or a significant decline is to come in gold, depending on which direction the consolidation breaks.</span>
<h3><b>How Would This Look on the Long-Term Chart?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term chart on page 1 is now stripped of its annotations so that we can envision how either a breakout higher or lower – as predicted by both our technical analysis and the record low volatility of present –  would manifest in the market:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2203 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Confluence-of-Support-Levels-Bottom-Zone-1024x451.png" alt="Confluence of Support Levels -Bottom Zone" width="840" height="370" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical analysis is about identifying high probability scenarios based on observable trends in the marketplace. It is no crystal ball, but it does help establish reasonable expectations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again: the breakout either higher or lower must begin by Q3 – Q4. This is based on the convergence of the pennant consolidation visible in the 18-month gold chart.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout higher should see an initial advance to target 2016 highs near $1,375 per ounce, followed by a modest retracement, en route to the $1,535 in 2018.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a break lower should see a rapid plunge to retest 2015 lows at $1,045, followed by a modest recovery, which would then open up the possibility of new lows within the green support band below $1,000.</span>
<h3><b>Worst Case Scenario</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We maintain that even the worst-case scenario of a drop below $1,000 will represent part of a larger multi-year bottoming process – and so: </span><b>how one should consider preparing is largely dependent on one’s individual time the horizon and risk tolerance.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those with shorter-term time horizons should be cautioned that if new lows formed, it could take gold several more years of basing to regain its upward trajectory. Yet accumulation throughout any final plunge would be a healthy plan for those looking to accumulate holdings as part of a long-term strategy.</span>

		<title>Silver’s Flash Crash</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/10/silvers-flash-crash/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> saw a “flash crash” on Thursday night EST / Friday morning in Asia, falling momentarily by at least $1.50 before recovering somewhat during the day.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The actual low print is up to some debate, depending on which exchange and contract one refer to the low bid for the spot market (shown below) according to our trading desk was $14.16, while some other platforms are showing the low as $14.50.<img class="alignright wp-image-2229 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Flash-crash.png" alt="Silver &quot;Flash, crash&quot;" width="579" height="448" /> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will be conservative and call the low $14.16. Either way, clearly the exchanges were overwhelmed with whoever decided to sell such a quantity of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> in such a short period.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many futures traders were stopped out at significant losses during the "flash crash". However, as discussed in recent articles, we have been monitoring negative leading signals in both the CRB commodity index and the gold/silver ratio for the past month, and so we were largely expecting the recent drops in metals prices.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Several analysts are calling this "flash crash" the final bottom for silver’s recent decline: they are likely premature in these calls. It is important to understand what happens during a "flash crash": someone dumps a huge amount of paper silver on the market at a single instant. Stops are taken out, and selling begets further selling as traders panic to avoid losses. The selling only stops when a significantly large entity – who is using lower leverage and thus does not run the risk of being stopped out by the waterfall decline – steps in with a sufficiently-large bid to absorb all the panic selling.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is: we now know where large entities are willing to buy silver. That figure is down near $14.16 or slightly above.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bad news is: that level is likely to be retested at least once, if not on multiple occasions over the next 3-6 months. In a worst-case scenario, the large bidder will be exhausted (though he will have absorbed most of the sellers), and a final low will occur marginally below the bidder’s established price ($14.16 at the lower range).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, we have here, in this flash crash, a strong piece of evidence to suggest that the low for silver’s current decline will occur in the low-to-mid $14 range. We will, of course, use other forms of technical analysis to zero in on this low as it approaches.</span>
<h3><b>On Manipulation</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a final note on silver: yes, we would consider this type of selling to be “manipulation” of the markets, by some entity. However, our goal is to be pragmatic: such manipulation is going to occur periodically in silver, so let us at least protect ourselves and possibly profit from these occasions, as opposed to standing by as mere victims as many commentators seem content to do in the precious metals world. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the long run, silver will eventually be moving higher.</span>
<h3><b>Silver Intermediate Outlook</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning to the silver chart itself, for the week gold’s cousin fell $1.20 or 7.2%, to close at $15.43 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.  The technical damage is reflected on the near-term chart and outlook:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2230 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Primary-resistance.png" alt="Silver technical damage" width="586" height="529" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our view is that, in percentage terms, the majority of silver’s decline is already behind us. A final drop to the low $14’s or mid $13’s would not constitute a significant further percentage drop – but it would sufficiently harm investor sentiment such that a functional retest of 2015 lows could mark the most important buying opportunity for the remainder of the decade.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The advance that occurs following a double-bottom scenario of the $13 - $14 region (equivalent to the 2015 lows) should be just as strong as the surge that began in first-half 2016… so let us remain prepared.</span>

		<title>Gold Technical Update</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week we noted that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver </a>had broken its year-long support zone between $15.75 - $16.15 during the prior week’s <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/10/silvers-flash-crash/">flash crash</a>. What does this apparent breakdown mean for gold? Let us update the technical perspective for gold for the short and intermediate timeframes:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2258" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Gold-for-the-short-and-intermediate-timeframes.png" alt="Gold for the short and intermediate time frames" width="1058" height="792" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the week as a sum, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> rose 1.5% or $18 to close at $1,227 as of the final trade in New York on Friday afternoon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks ago, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> broke short-term rising support at $1,232 (turquoise line, above). This trendline was rising, and we must recall that retests of rising trendlines can indeed occur at a different (in this case higher) price level than the original breakdown point.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, our best assessment is that gold is set to move moderately higher for the remainder of July and into August below its broken short-term support. This means that gold should continue moderately higher for the next 4-6 weeks below $1,250. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect gold will not regain its broken (turquoise color) trendline yet, and so the precious metal should then begin to turn lower again by late August, toward a test of its lower (blue) boundary of the pennant consolidation. This level now comes in at $1,175 and is rising by the day.</span>
<h3><b>On a Gold Recapture of Broken Trendline</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If gold were to negate its recent breakdown and recapture $1,250, the convergence of this short-term (turquoise) trend and the long-term (magenta color) 2011-2017 downtrend would occur at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly the same price level</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by late-August: $1,250. So, it would be one of the clearest technical signals we could ask for to indicate a new strong rising trend had begun, as both a breakout from a short-term and long-term resistance level simultaneously. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Officially, there are 5.5 months left before the giant pennant-shaped consolidation shown above must resolve in one direction or another. This would be quite literally at the end of the calendar year in December, visible at the far right of the chart above. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the vast majority of historic examples, these patterns will resolve several months before the actual apex occurs. The August – October timeframe is our best estimation, as for confirmation to whether we will have a legitimate bull market on our hands or the beginning of a decline to new lows perhaps below the 2015 bottoms. There will be opportunities to profit and/or protect ourselves in either scenario, but we must get the primary direction correct first. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, short-term traders are cautioned that </span><b>whiplash is likely</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as gold is officially “trendless” – having broken both its short-term downtrend since June and its intermediate rising trend from January lows – all within the confines of the much larger consolidation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect volatility to begin lessening and for gold to appear almost comatose during the last several weeks immediately prior to either a breakdown or breakout in the August – October timeframe.</span>
<h3><b>Investment Considerations</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">How one chooses to position prior to the resolution of gold’s giant consolidation pattern is largely a factor of personal goals, time horizons, and risk tolerance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, an investor on a long-term accumulation plan, who is investing 10% - 20% of his/her assets into gold as either long-term savings or a “wealth insurance” policy, would likely welcome a period of lower prices should they manifest. After all, buying an asset for lower prices over the short-run can lead to a lower dollar-cost average price for the long-term holding.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, those with a shorter-term time horizon might choose to pay closer attention to the resolution of the chart pattern shown above. If the pattern resolves higher, gold is calculated to see a surge of $200 - $300 within the following 12 months. However, if the pattern resolves lower, an equally large decline is what the target calls for. These might sound like two extreme scenarios – yet these are exactly the types of moves that are predicted from the resolution of converging consolidation patterns.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are now in the terminal last months of gold’s consolidation. Readers should not assume that gold will remain so quiet going forward as it has over the past year. Please stay tuned as we zero in on leading indicators over the next few months which should help us gain insight into gold’s coming resolution in one direction or the other.  </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> have recovered moderately over the past two weeks, yet still remain within the confines of the ongoing consolidations we have been monitoring over the last several months. For the week, gold rose 2.2% or $27 to close at $1,255 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile, silver posted a gain of 3.3% or $0.52 cents, to close at $16.46. Over the short run, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver's</a> recovery and close on a weekly basis above the key $16 level is certainly a positive sign that buyers remain ready to step in anytime the price drops into the $15’s.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is periodically beneficial to focus not only on gold and silver themselves in isolation but to examine the ratio between the two metals. In other words, we are referring to the number of ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a backdrop, readers should know that in general throughout history, a falling gold to silver ratio has tended to correspond with rising prices in both precious metals, whereas a rising gold to silver ratio has tended to correspond with falling prices in the metals. Of course, there are exceptions to every rule, but this is the prevailing trend that we observe when examining the ratio throughout history.</span>
<h3><b>Why does a falling gold to silver ratio correspond with rising gold and silver prices?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several reasons for this phenomenon. First, the silver market is extremely small compared to the gold market. For example, in 2016 just over 1 billion ounces of silver were produced from mining and scrap supply. Yet of this, approximately 80% or 800 million ounces were used for industrial fabrication: a combination of jewelry, silverware, electronics, solar panels, and photography. This silver was essentially “consumed” by industry or permanently taken off the market. What this means is that in 2016, only 200 million ounces were available for investment demand.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the industry has consumed the majority of silver for several decades, it is estimated that only 2-3 billion ounces exist above ground in readily investible form, meaning coins and bars. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare this to gold, in which the industrial demand is tiny in that only 16% of the 128 million ounces purchased in 2016 were used for fabrication. Of course, this means that 84% of the gold produced in 2016 is still available to the market in one form or another.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taken as a sum, we can see that in dollar terms, the total physical silver available in investible form pales in comparison to the total quantity of gold available. Most of the silver brought to market has been consumed by industry over the last 50 years. Not so with gold.</span>
<h3><b>What Happens in a Rising Gold Price Environment?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the much greater quantity of gold than silver that exists above ground for investment purposes, we must consider what happens in a rising precious metals price environment. Gold prices initially begin to rise due to purchases from larger players: central banks, institutions, sovereign wealth funds, and some forward-looking individuals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the rare exception (Warren Buffet bought 130 million ounces in 1998), silver is generally not the target of the central bank or institutional demand. Yet, importantly, silver is the target of individual investor demand. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The real power in the silver market lies in the potential for it to become the primary target for the individual investor. In a rising metals price backdrop, there will come a point when the average person does not have the resources available to purchase an ounce of gold. Where will he turn?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout history, the answer is silver.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine that an investor desires to move $10,000 into precious metals and that he chooses to split this investment evenly at 50% gold and 50% silver. With that split at today’s prices, he will just barely purchase 4 ounces of gold, yet over 300 ounces of silver (ignoring premiums). Again, let us remember that despite their vastly different values, there is more physical gold available above ground than silver. So here, by splitting a purchase evenly between the two metals, a single investor has taken possession of a much greater quantity of the world’s investable silver than of that for gold.</span>
<h3><b>What if 10% of the Population Wanted to Buy 10 Ounces of Silver?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now consider a scenario for the future, that as gold exceeds $1,500 in the years ahead, the average investor is largely priced out of the gold market. Again, where will he turn?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If 10% of the United States’ 320 million citizens each wanted to purchase 10 ounces of silver, the entire available investment supply for the year would be wiped out. What if 10% of the world’s 7.5 billion people each wanted to own 10 ounces? </span>
<h3><b>Returning to the Gold to Silver Ratio</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential for the precious metals, and especially silver, is significant over the years to come. While the ongoing corrections could continue for some time further, investors should carefully consider the underlying supply and demand fundamentals for the precious metals which will eventually exert themselves. In a rising gold price environment, silver will often lag initially, but when it does begin to gain interest from the average investor, even a modest inflow of capital into the “lesser” metal will have an oversized effect on its price. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We close with a long-term look at the gold to silver ratio. Currently, at 76 ounces of silver to purchase one ounce of gold, at the last precious metals peak in 1980, this ratio hit 17. As we can see, there have been several multi-year uptrends in favor of gold, amidst what appears to be a generational decline in the ratio (in favor of silver). Our expectation is that by the time the current cycle ends, the ratio will once again reach levels last seen in 1980.</span>

		<title>US Dollar Approaching Critical Support</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/31/us-dollar-approaching-critical-support/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2017 16:55:00 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important for precious metals investors to follow the valuation of the US dollar versus other foreign currencies because as a general principle, being the world’s reserve currency still to this day, when the dollar sees periods of rapid decline investors tend to seek safety… and some of that safety flow will move into precious metals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we chart the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies including the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, and the Canadian dollar. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the false breakout at multi-decade highs last January, the US dollar has declined with such ferocious momentum that it has surprised even our initial outlook from this past spring. Our initial target to the downside was 95.5 (green callout) and this level has not only been hit but exceeded. In the wake of a dovish indication from the Federal Reserve last week that it may not desire to “normalize” its balance sheet as quickly as many assumed, the USD has continued to plummet all the way down to the nearly 3-year “Critical Support Zone” labeled below in black. This zone extends from 91.9 to 93.1 on the dollar index.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2312 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/US-Dollar-Index.png" alt="US Dollar Index" width="830" height="491" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having closed at 93.1 for the week, the dollar is now effectively testing this critical support zone.</span>
<h3><b>Dollar Set for a Technical Bounce</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the short term, we would expect the dollar to bounce in this region. </span><b>The nature of the bounce will be important to monitor.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The false breakout pattern at a multi-decade high is a rare and significant technical signal for a possible long-term reversal, and so we expect that a bounce from current levels for the dollar will not be anything more than a relief rally, not to exceed the declining (dashed blue) downtrend line. This scenario is highlighted in green.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A less probable scenario would be that the dollar stages a more significant relief rally which breaks its new downtrend, but which does not exceed the resistance zone between 99.5 – 100.5.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The strength of the expected bounce will tell us much about the dollar going forward. Should the dollar stage a larger rally, it will be signaling that the decline we expect over the coming years will be slower and more grinding in nature, perhaps taking an equal 8-years to fall to all-time lows near 72 on the index, levels last seen in 2008.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, should the dollar merely show a weak bounce, staying below its new trendline, not exceeding 95.5 on the way higher and then plunging through the critical support zone, the stage will be set for a more immediate and precipitous drop in the US currency over just the next 12 months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Take, for example, the period to the far left of the chart from mid-2014 to early-2015, in which the dollar rose from 80 to 100.5 within eight months. It is entirely conceivable that in a precipitous dollar decline, the greenback could return just as quickly to the 79-80 region over a similar time frame. This would equate to nearly a 15% further drop in just a year.</span>
<h3><b>Long-Term Dollar Indicator</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider our monthly momentum indicator for the dollar, dating back to the mid-1980’s. According to this model, </span><b>the top just seen in the dollar was the most significant of the past 30 years, </b><b>registering an even more overbought reading than the 2001-2003 top</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For reference, recall that the decline which began in the dollar in 2001 at 118 on the index coincided with the all-time low in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> at $255 per ounce.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2313 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/US-Dollar-Index-Monthly.png" alt="US Dollar Index Monthly" width="1047" height="736" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider, too, that the decline which followed the 2001 top resulted in over a 40% loss in the value of the dollar in just six years. Were such a percentage decline to occur again from this greater-magnitude signal, the target would be 62 on the index by 2023, or of the Y-axis below the chart. </span>
<h3><b>Metals Have Not Responded to USD Weakness… Yet</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, what remains to be seen is: when do <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> begin to respond to the dollar’s decline? From 2003 – 2008, there was a strong day-to-day inverse correlation between the dollar and gold. Recently, however, precious metals traders have been largely ignoring the bulk of the decline in the US dollar up to this point.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When will traders begin to notice the decline in the world’s reserve currency? We cannot say for certain, but we will begin to pick up the change in behavior when it registers on the charts, as we should begin to see $10 - $20 spikes in gold on specific days when the dollar falls by 0.5% - 1.0% on the index.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whichever form the pending bounce takes will tell us much about the strength or lack thereof for the dollar to be expected over the next several years.</span>

		<title>Bitcoin has forked creating the new Bitcoin Cash</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The leading digital currency has officially forked today. Bitcoin power brokers couldn’t adopt a single solution which would have preserved the integrity of the famous cryptocurrency, forcing it to split in Bitcoin and the newly created Bitcoin Cash, causing BTC trade slightly lower this Tuesday morning.</span>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">**</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The civil war between developers and miners over Bitcoin’s future has caused the well-known cryptocurrency to fork today. While core developers wanted to keep bitcoin network’s blocks intact to protect it from hacks, some miners have aggressively promoted their solution of speeding up the network by increasing the block’s size.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The risk of getting Bitcoin transactions stuck in limbo for hours or days, therefore, increasing the next blocks’ cost (since the miners’ fee will also get higher), determined the Bitcoin community to come up with a new solution of speeding up the Bitcoin transactions’ approval process by forking the digital currency.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A fork is a "change to the software of the digital currency that creates two separate versions of the blockchain with a shared history." There were disagreements on whether to adopt a soft or hard fork – to create a new chain and ‘wipe out’ the weakest one or to permanently split the chain and create two Bitcoin versions. In the end, the hard fork was the one adopted after Tuesday’s morning deadline, generating a new Bitcoin – the Bitcoin Cash. The major difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is the block size, 1MB vs. 8MB, which is a promise of a faster transaction approval.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The hard fork created an identical blockchain, so it mirrored the people’s existing bitcoin wealth in Bitcoin Cash. The new digital currency was immediately bootstrapped by in-built value. Futures for the new Bitcoin gave back all of an initial 48% hike to $422 but traded 12% lower near $255 as of 1:53 PM, ET.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Forks had occurred in cryptocurrencies before, like the Bitcoin's rival, Ethereum, which also forked in 2016 and created the form of the digital currency we know today. Bitcoin miners have been able to mine for new bitcoins since this morning yet the first Bitcoin cash was reportedly mined at about 2:20 PM. Some analysts noted that Bitcoin Cash required the same amount of computational work as the original Bitcoin, but a significantly smaller number of miners are trying to create the new cryptocurrency.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Cash’s larger block size may prompt investors to forsake Bitcoin in new currency’s favor, which would be negative for the price of the original Bitcoin. Since the Bitcoin Cash has drawn its initial value from Bitcoin's market capitalization, it caused the bitcoin's value slightly drop after its adoption. Though, the entire market is still keeping an eye on the Bitcoin Cash to see " how the situation evolves."</span>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In past articles, we have discussed the generally-antagonistic relationship between <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold </a>and the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/31/us-dollar-approaching-critical-support/">US dollar</a>. Still to this day the world’s reserve currency, as precious metals investors we must always keep a close eye on the value of the dollar, as gold stands to be a primary beneficiary if in fact the dollar ever loses a significant amount of value in the future.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the value of the dollar versus all foreign currencies must regularly be considered, there is one cross-pair that deserves special attention for its relationship with gold. And that is the dollar versus the Japanese yen. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise labeled “JPY/USD”, we are hereby referring to the value of the Japanese yen as priced in US dollars. How is JPY/USD related to gold?</span>
<h3><b>JPY/USD and Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The clearest way to show the importance of the JPY/USD cross-pair and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is to plot a direct comparison between the two. Below we show JPY/USD (multiplied by 100 for scale) on top, with the price of gold immediately below, since the 2011 peak in gold at $1,923 per ounce:</span>

<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2353" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Japanese-Yen_comparison.png" alt="Japanese Yen_comparison" width="531" height="549" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The similarity between these two charts is striking. For example, note how the absolute highs for both gold at $1,923 per ounce and for JPY/USD at 1.32 occurred in Q3 2011. Note too how the large drop in gold which occurred between October 2012 and June 2013 when the metal fell from $1,800 down to $1,175 coincided precisely with the JPY/USD decline from 1.30 down to 0.98. Both continued to bring lower until 2015.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both assets also surged simultaneously during the first half of 2016, only to give back much of those gains in tandem during the second half of the year.</span>
<h3><b>Ratio Plot</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to view the relationship between these two assets is in the form of a ratio. Below we plot JPY/USD divided by the price of gold, since 1998. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In plain English, this ratio asks: “How does the value of the Japanese yen compare to the value of gold?”</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2354" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Japanese-Gold-ratio.png" alt="Japanese ,Gold ratio" width="1144" height="588" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see that over time the graph has moved lower. This means that over the past two decades the Japanese yen has lost considerable value versus gold; in other words, gold has risen as priced in yen. This should generally be expected, as we know all fiat currencies are being debased by their respective central banks over time.</span>
<h3><b>The Yen / Gold Correlation</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">What is perhaps not so expected is to see the tight correlation since late-2011 that has developed between the Japanese yen and the price of gold.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This correlation can be seen on the lower right corner of the chart via the blue converging trendlines, with the nearly flat price action since 2011.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When a ratio such as this flat lines, it tells us that the two components are highly positively correlated: the two assets are moving closely in tandem. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this instance, the flat line in the ratio confirms that the Japanese yen to US dollar cross pair is behaving nearly identically to the price of gold. In other words, </span><b>since 2011 the yen and gold are behaving as the same asset class.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The proof for this statement is visible in the first set of charts that we have shown.</span>
<h3><b>Yen and Gold – the Same?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, fundamentally we know that the Japanese yen and gold are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the same asset classes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, one is a fiat currency which may be printed ad infinitum by a central bank, while the other is a finite element which has served as a store of wealth for at least 5,000 years.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundamentally, the yen and gold are certainly not equal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, as we see from the graphs above, the market is treating the two as essentially the same since 2011. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are we, as investors, to make the nearly perfect correlation between the Japanese currency and gold? Why are these two markets so tightly intertwined? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, when will the correlation cease, and how can we use this knowledge in our investment plans going forward?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will address these questions and more in Part II of this series on the Japanese yen versus gold, next week…</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/07/are-gold-and-the-japanese-yen-equal-part-i/">Part 1 of this series</a> last week, we examined the relationship between the Japanese yen and gold. We showed that both yen and gold have been highly correlated since 2011, moving closely in tandem during both corrections and surges since their respective peaks nearly six years ago.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As precious metals investors, what are we to make of this correlation? And how can we use the correlation to our advantage in the future?</span>
<h3><b>Why Does the Correlation Exist?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, let us address the “why” behind the yen/<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> correlation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line is that no one truly knows why the correlation exists because correlations between diverse asset classes never exist for solely one reason. Anyone who claims to have “the” answer in reality only has one of the said answers – because markets are made up millions of individuals, each acting on their own particular causes and assumptions. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, we can look to identify some contributing causes. Much of the correlation has to do with the perceived safety status of the Japanese yen. Although still a fiat currency, the yen in recent years has come to be known in the international trade as one of the safest currencies in the world, perhaps even more so than the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/31/us-dollar-approaching-critical-support/">US dollar. </a></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan is notable for its low inflation relative to other developed world economies. Although the country has a large public debt, much of that debt is held domestically by investors. Japan also has a significant trade surplus, selling more to foreign trade partners than it imports. The yen-carry trade, a popular funding mechanism of the past decade in which investors borrow Japanese yen to buy assets in foreign countries, is a testament to the perceived stability of the Japanese economy and its ultra-low interest rates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these reasons contribute to the safe-haven status of the yen, which in turn drives the correlation with gold.</span>
<h3><b>Looking for Confirmation Signals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there is a myriad of reasons why the correlation is in place, for our purposes it will be more valuable to accept that it does indeed exist, and to next look for ways to utilize this information. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the more valuable forms of analysis we can thereby perform is to monitor for either confirmation or non-confirmation signals between the yen to dollar cross-pair (JPY/USD) and gold. These can help us gauge major turning points in the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in June 2015 gold began to make new lows under the $1,200/oz mark, eventually hitting $1,045 in December of that year. However, note that the Japanese yen failed to make a new similar low, instead of increasing marginally from 0.7950 to 0.8125 during this time:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2394" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Jap-Yen-to-US-Dollar.png" alt="Jap Yen to US Dollar" width="652" height="685" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall the main chart from last week’s article, showing the near perfect correlation over six years between the pair. Here in 2015 was a non-confirmation signal for gold’s final plunge in 2015. The yen and gold were, in fact, moving in opposite directions as a net sum over the final months of the decline.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What did this non-confirmation in the yen signal for gold? We will let the charts speak for themselves, by extending out the above by another seven months:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2395" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Japanese-Yen-to-US-Dollar.png" alt="Japanese Yen to US Dollar" width="645" height="691" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is clear that the non-confirmation signal in the yen in late 2015 was an excellent predictor of what is now seen as the final low for gold’s 2011 – 2015 bear market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an important signal for those who are interested in gauging likely turning points in the gold market. Of course, no signal will be perfect 100% of the time. But we can push the odds of probability into our favor for the gold market if we pay attention to these confirmation or non-confirmation signals in the Japanese yen.</span>
<h3><b>Watch for the Correlation to End</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A final point on the topic for the time being: no correlation will last forever. There will come a time when – for fundamental reasons which will only be revealed after the fact – the tight correlation between the yen and gold will sever.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What more, the </span><b>period of time following the breaking of this relationship will be important for precious metals investors to pay attention to</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because it will signify either a rapid acceleration higher in the price of gold, or a severe plunge, depending on the direction in which the correlation breaks. To illustrate, refer to the following set of imbedded charts of the yen/gold ratio:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2396" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Japanese-Yen-and-Gold-ratio.png" alt="Japanese Yen and Gold ratio" width="932" height="874" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will know the correlation is ending when the yen/gold ratio breaks either above or below the converging set of (blue) trendlines which have defined the relationship since 2011. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When zoomed in (bottom chart), due to the extension of the y-axis on this timescale, it appears that there is much variability which can still occur in the confines of this relationship. However, when we refer back to the original (top) chart, we can see that in the grand scheme of these two asset classes, the correlation is still very tight indeed. A breaking point could come at any time within the next 12-24 months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the convergence breaks higher (less likely) it will signify that the yen is set to gain value relative to gold. Conversely, if the ratio breaks lower (more likely) it will hint that after six years gold is finally ready to resume leadership amongst the safe-haven assets again, with a price rise in all currencies including the yen.</span>

		<title>Gold Breakout – Higher Targets in Sight</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/21/gold-breakout-higher-targets-in-sight/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks ago <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> broke higher through the long-term declining downtrend which has defined the period of falling prices since 2011. That year, gold peaked at $1,923 per ounce, while <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> peaked just shy of $50. Over the past six years, despite many attempts to gather momentum to the upside, gold has been unable to overcome this key technical resistance level. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the surge of first-half 2016, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> has made no less than seven attempts to overcome this downtrend. Those attempts are highlighted on the chart below by the magenta-colored arrows. Each time gold reached this declining trend, sellers showed up, and forced the price back lower – sometimes by only $40 - $50 per ounce, yet sometimes by over $200 per ounce, as was seen last November.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2441" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Gold-2011-present.png" alt="Gold 2011- present" width="1060" height="793" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold has now made its most legitimate breakout attempt – and furthermore, it has sustained the breakout for two full weeks. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we examine price projections, we must note that for the breakout to remain valid, </span><b>prices must remain above $1,260 on a daily closing basis</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If this level were to fail, it would invalidate the breakout, and we would have (once again) another failed attempt. False-moves are possible in all markets, and the best way to handle them is to have a defined price point whereby if a failure occurs, we can examine alternate scenarios. Again, $1,260 must hold – and thus far, prices have done so.</span>
<h3><b>Breakout Importance</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of this trend break should not be underestimated. Many technical-based buyers have remained on the sidelines for the past six years as gold prices moved lower and then drifted sideways. A sustained break above a declining trendline is often a signal that investors will use to tell them the period of falling prices is likely over. We expect these investors will begin entering the gold market in the near future, and momentum will begin to build.</span>
<h3><b>Short-Term Resistance Levels</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next several weeks, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/05/gold-a-large-move-is-approaching/">gold</a> still must overcome the $1,300 zone as initial resistance. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,300 has held prices lower since the reversal which took place on the night of Trump’s victory, last November. This is presently the third attempt for gold to overcome this price, and each attempt represents a “chipping away” by buyers at the overhang of sellers who are exiting their positions near break even. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What will typically happen as a specific horizontal resistance level is preparing to be broken is that the reactions lower on each failure will become less and less severe, indicating buyers are stepping in at higher price points at every sell-off. In the near future, we expect $1,300 will be broken – and at that point, a whole new class of buyers will begin paying attention to the precious metals market.</span>
<h3><b>Intermediate Price Targets</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming gold can remain above $1,260 and soon recapture $1,300, thus solidifying the long-term downtrend break, we have much higher price targets ahead over the next 6-18 months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Three specific price targets occur within a close proximity, and this confluence represents our highest probability target:</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consolidation which took place from December 2015 through August 2017 featured an amplitude of $330 per ounce, from the low of $1,045 to the high of $1,375. This consolidation took place in the form of a giant triangle-shaped formation. In technical analysis when triangle-consolidation breaks, the target is derived from an equal measurement of the amplitude ($330), added onto the apex of the triangle ($1,205). This calculation gives a target of $1,535. </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is clear horizontal resistance visible on the chart at $1,525 (black line). This level formerly acted as support in 2011 – 2013 and then failed on the fourth test in early 2013. Generally, defined former support levels will subsequently act as resistance on the next attempt to overcome them as sellers emerge.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire 2011 – 2015 decline comes in at $1,485. Fibonacci was an Italian mathematician of the 12</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century who discovered that many aspects of nature – sea shells, hurricanes, flower petals – all follow a similar ratio pattern. Financial markets often follow these similar patterns, the markets being a component of (human) nature.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, </span><b>we have three strong technical targets between $1,485 - $1,535, and this level represents our highest probability for a future intermediate gold peak</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These targets should be reached within 6-18 months, depending on the host of geopolitical and market factors impacting the precious metals. These represent starting targets only, at which point new analysis will be required.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming gold maintains above $1,260 in the coming weeks, this technical breakout is significant and bears monitoring by investors. We expect that when $1,300 is broken, momentum will begin to pick up notably on the way to the higher targets. Investors may choose to accelerate a certain percentage of purchases as fitting in with an overall investment plan.</span>

		<title>Thoughts on Precious Metals as Summer Winds Down</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">As summer winds down in the northern hemisphere, first and foremost our thoughts and prayers go out to those who are being impacted by the destruction of Hurricane Harvey in Texas.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer tends to be the slowest time of year for most of the financial markets. The phrase “sell in May and go away” summarizes the strategy that many traders take of exiting their positions at the end of the spring and not returning until after Labor Day. Although the precious metals occupy a unique space within the investment world, some of these same seasonal factors do impact the prices of the metals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us examine the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> seasonality chart, showing average monthly returns since 1975:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2477 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/a_seasonal.png" alt="Gold seasonality" width="681" height="344" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we can see, the May through July period is historically the slowest of the year for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, featuring not only the lowest volatility but often an important price low forming in July.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The strong seasonal period begins in August and continues through September, largely as a result of physical demand from the Indian wedding and Chinese holiday seasons. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we should point out that after what is typically a weak month in October, gold still has four strong months ahead through February. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, the August through February period is the strongest time for precious metals historically, and we are now at the beginning of that period, with gold already having broken through its long-term downtrend technical resistance (<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/21/gold-breakout-higher-targets-in-sight/">see the article</a>, last week).</span>
<h3><b>Volatility Remains at Record Lows</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us not forget, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold</a> is approaching its strongest period of the year amidst what is still the lowest daily volatility observed over the past nine years. Below we update gold’s volatility chart:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2478 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b_vol.png" alt="Gold Index" width="686" height="266" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility is a direction-neutral measure. In other words, it only tells us that a period of higher volatility is set to follow, but not in which direction the upcoming moves will occur. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When we juxtapose strong seasonality factors emerging amidst a market that is within record-low volatility and already showing initial hints of technical breakouts, what we can say is that the precious metals are set for strong moves ahead. Our initial assessment is that those moves will be higher, but we will not take anything for granted and always keep one eye on the charts on a regular basis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The charts we feature here focus primarily on the “what” aspect of the market – they do not tell us the “why”. The metals are like dry tinder at present with lightning visible in the distance. The market is waiting for a spark… what could that be?</span>
<h3><b>Potential Sparks for Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tensions are brewing amongst US economic policymakers, and Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, gave an example of that on Friday. In a speech at the economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Yellen discussed the role that the US central bank had in propping up the financial system after the crash of 2008 through bailouts and increased regulation. The most prescient quote from the speech was as follows:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><b>Because of the reforms that strengthened our financial system</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>and with support from monetary and other policies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, credit is available on good terms, and lending has advanced broadly in line with economic activity in recent years, contributing to today’s strong economy.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we see Yellen hinting that she will not favor the loosening of regulations that were enacted after the financial crisis of 2008, something the Trump administration has pushed for in recent months. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yellen’s term as chairwoman is up this February and speculation is that Trump may not re-nominate her for the position. The speech at Jackson Hole tends to reinforce that a shakeup may be coming at the Fed early next year. And uncertainty in the financial system tends to provide support for gold.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, saber-rattling continues between the United States and North Korea. While gold price spikes based on the fear of isolated geopolitical events tend to not be sustained, certainly if any sort of extended political or military confrontation were to develop between these two nuclear powers, gold would see a sustained bid. At what point do these idle threats that we see quoted so often begin to be taken seriously by one side or the other?</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2479" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/c_korea-1.png" alt="" width="620" height="313" />
<h3><b>Takeaway on the End of Summer and Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial technical breakouts have already been observed on the charts in recent weeks.  Gold is entering its historically-strongest period of the year due to seasonal demand from India and China, amidst a backdrop of decade-low volatility. The precious metals are set to react strongly when a fundamental spark presents itself. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy your final week of the summer!  </span>

The 2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lunar Program started in 2008 with the “<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2008-1-kilo-silver-lunar-year-of-the-mouse-coin">Year of the Mouse</a>” issue and since then, these astonishing collectibles have been one of the most eagerly awaited yearly releases. Since the 1 oz. Lunar coins are struck with an issue limit, these outstanding gold and silver coins are believed to quickly go out of stock.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These magnificent coins celebrate the Year of the Dog, one of the twelve animals of the Chinese Calendar. The Lunar Years of the Dog are 1922, 1934, 1946, 1958, 1970, 1982, 1994, 2006 and 2018, and those who are born under this sign are considered as amiable, kind, friendly, and loyal. Meticulously struck from .9999 fine silver and gold in bullion quality, these exceptional coins are an excellent anniversary gift and a treasured addition to any portfolio.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reverse side of the 2018 Year of the Dog Silver Lunar Coin showcase a German Shepherd dog and pup lying in the grass with Chinese peony flowers in the background, framed by the inscriptions “Year of the Dog”, “P” mintmark and the Chinese character for “dog”. The gold coin’s reverse depicts a Labrador Retriever on rocks and featuring a stylized pine tree in the background encircled by the same inscriptions. Their obverse side displays the renowned effigy of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, courtesy of Ian Rank-Broadley, surrounded by the coin’s denomination, purity, weight and the engravings “Elizabeth II”, “Australia”, and “2018”.</span>

		<title>Lessons from September 11 for Gold Prices</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/09/11/lessons-from-september-11-for-gold-prices/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a common warning given in the mainstream financial press that goes something like this: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do not buy gold during a geopolitical crisis because as soon as tensions fade the precious metal will give back all of its gains.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to look no further than recent articles available online to confirm this warning, such as this one published last week from CNBC:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2553" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/12-month-high-on-North-Korea-a_CNBC.png" alt="12 month high on North Korea a_CNBC" width="428" height="528" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the above warning accurate? Are the “experts” correct that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> should retrace if recent tensions with North Korea recede?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is: it depends on what timescale one is referring to. Yet by making a blanket statement and not quantifying the above warning with the proper perspective, this and similar articles risk misleading investors as a critical time period unfolds for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> over the next few years.  Let us examine a historical example.</span>
<h3><b>September 11</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Exactly 16 years ago today, let us rewind back to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to examine the price action in gold from a technical basis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">September 11 was a Tuesday, and on the day of the attacks, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins/gold-american-eagle/gold-eagles">gold</a> spiked in price from $273 per ounce to $290, a 6.2% gain. In today’s dollars, that would equate to an $84 intraday spike. The price action in the year leading up to the attack and in the months following is shown below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2554" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2-pic.-b_911.png" alt="2 pic. b_911" width="955" height="714" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that after the September 11 surge, gold topped out over the following three weeks just below $300 per ounce. Moreover, in the two months that followed and as fears of an Armageddon scenario faded, gold did indeed give back all of its gains. Specifically, on November 24, gold closed below $272, which was the opening price from the morning of 9/11.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many who bought gold in the days following the attacks were surely frustrated to be sitting on losses within a few months, and those who did not put this price action into proper context likely sold and moved on to other asset classes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But even though gold did give back all of its short-term gains, was selling and moving on wise in hindsight?</span>
<h3><b>Increased Technical Perspective</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us back out the above chart for increased perspective to examine some of the technical trends that were in play at the time. Below we show gold from 1997 – 2002. The same 9/11 geopolitical price spike is again highlighted:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2560" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/c_9702.png" alt="c_9702" width="1102" height="825" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, gold had seen significant multi-year downtrend breaks leading up to the 9/11 price spike, shown above by the red callouts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A double-bottom was observed in April 2001, matching within a few dollars the July 1999 price of $252 per ounce.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, gold was showing several classic technical patterns indicating that a trend change from the prior years of falling prices was in the process of unfolding. The September 11 terrorist-related spike, while it was given back over the course of the following two months, was itself actually part of a longer basing formation for the precious metals in the early 2000’s.</span>
<h3><b>Longer-Term Perspective</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">How did the “isolated” September 11 price spike look when viewed within the context of the bull market which unfolded over the next 10 years? The following chart speaks for itself, where the spike can barely be seen amidst the more significant bottom that served as a launching pad for the next decade. </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2557" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pic-4-Geopolitical-price-d_LT.png" alt="pic 4 Geopolitical price d_LT" width="1075" height="804" />
<h3><b>Back to the Present</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tensions between the United States and North Korea continue to pick up in intensity. The gold price has spiked nearly $100 over the last six weeks. If tensions fade, will gold give back all of its gains?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, would selling in such a scenario be the proper decision?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Examine the gold price action since 2011, below. Note the now-ongoing five-year cup base formation that is nearing its later stages, following an important break of the 2011 – 2017 downtrend. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Does this chart not bear striking resemblance to the 1997 – 2002 chart, above, which also featured similar downtrend breaks amidst a multi-year cup basing formation?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You be the judge.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2556" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pic-3-Cup-Base-e_current-1.png" alt="pic 3 Cup Base e_current" width="1125" height="842" />
<h3><b>Takeaway on Geopolitical Events and Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold may indeed see a short-term retracement if tensions fade between the United States and North Korea (<a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/09/05/gold-breaks-2016-high-in-japan-us-to-follow/">Read our previous article</a>). Gold could give back $100 per ounce just as quickly as it gained it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the historic store of wealth is now five years into a clear basing process, one that is playing out irrespective of any short-term geopolitical price spikes. Multi-year bases are important setups for future market trends. The lessons from the 1997 – 2002 timeframe, which includes the spike seen on September 11, should be important for investors to keep in mind as they navigate what should be a volatile final quarter to 2017. Geopolitical tensions come and go, but the unemotional language of the charts contains a message all its own.</span>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello KenF, 
Thank you for your great feedback. We're all less or more forced by media and "advisers" around to buy, buy and buy! These timeless questions every investor has: Is now the best time to invest? How to invest wisely?  It’s always difficult to determine if now is the right time to invest and we have to set your objectives (short and long term) for making the appropriate investment selections and stick with our own plan based on daily market changes.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Christopher,
I really enjoyed your article. It was refreshing to see something written about gold that wasn't all about buy, buy, buy!  
You are right about gold being the 'crisis' investment. But not just about geopolitical crisis, but any crisis.
Fear seems to drive the price of gold more than anything. Especially when you consider what percentage of gold is needed in industry and how much of it is going to just to feed our desire to own it. While a much higher percentage of platinum and silver is needed in indsutry, gold is still king because we want it.
And history has shown that people will do a lot of strange and inconceivable things to own gold.
But while all your charts are extremely interesting, the big wildcard in the entire equation is human emotion.  And there's just no way to chart or predict that aspect and its effect on the value of gold.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">From the landmark American Silver Eagle and Canadian Silver Maple Leaf to the latter-day Silver Queen’s Beast and Silver Krugerrand, this article presents the top ten </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best silver coins to buy in 2018. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a look at their unmatched features and designs and choose your favorite piece to invest as we go into the new year.</span>
<h3><b>10 </b><b>Best Silver Coins to Invest to</b><b> in 2018:</b></h3>
<ul>
 	<li><b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2018-1-oz-silver-american-eagle-bu">2018 1 oz Silver American Eagle $1 Coin BU</a></b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Silver Eagle is certainly one of the most eagerly awaited silver bullion coins of each year. A timeless addition to any portfolio, the astounding 1 troy ounce, .999 fine silver coin is the official silver legal tender of the country, carrying a denomination of $1 USD and a remarkable, classic design – the Walking Liberty on the obverse and the heraldic eagle on the reverse. The US Mint produces the American Silver Eagle coin with two other finishes, proof and burnished, and also offers it in rolls of 20 and monster boxes of 500 coins – an excellent option for those interested in bulk investments. Having been struck for more than 30 years, this exceptional coin is an undeniable symbol of patriotism, equality, freedom, and the American spirit, making it a must-have for any investor or numismatist, and a perfect choice for IRA savings.</span>

<ul>
 	<li><b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2018-5-oz-silver-atb-pictured-rocks-national-lakeshore">2018 5 oz Silver America the Beautiful ATB Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore Coin</a></b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Mint’s first-ever 5 oz. coin and also its largest silver bullion coin to date, the stunning America the Beautiful Quarter series will mark its 41</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> edition by introducing the 2018 5 oz Silver  ATB Michigan Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore Coin. This incredibly beautiful quarter commemorates Michigan and its superb Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore Park by showcasing one of its colorful sandstone cliffs with an imposing tree flourishing its roots atop it. Carrying on its obverse the portrait of George Washington created by John Flanagan, this is the first time this outstanding series depicts a national lakeshore on its reverse.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With a weight of 5 troy ounces and a .999 silver purity, this monumental US coinage piece is also offered in rolls of 10 coins and monster boxes of 100. This release is a sought-after addition due to its artistic value and will be followed in 2018 by the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore Quarter, the Voyageurs National Park Quarter, the Cumberland Island National Seashore Quarter and the Block Island National Wildlife Refuge Quarter.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2681" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-ATb_-Lakeshore.jpg" alt="2018 ATB_ Lakeshore" width="450" height="250" />
<ul>
 	<li><b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2018-1-oz-silver-canadian-maple-leaf-bu">2018 1 oz Silver Canadian Maple Leaf .9999 Fine $5 Coin BU</a></b></li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Federal Reserve begins its once-per-six-weeks policy meeting on Tuesday, with a statement to be issued by Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Wednesday at 2 pm EST. Expect lower volatility across most markets on Tuesday and Wednesday prior to the announcement, with a spike in volatility immediately after 2 pm. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot know exactly what will be announced on Wednesday, but the charts are positioning themselves for an important low to form across the precious metals complex coming into the meeting. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The markets are pricing in a near-zero chance of an interest rate hike on Wednesday, with roughly a 50% chance for a hike at the last meeting of the year in December.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we show the current dot-plot for interest rate expectations by the 16 members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which gives a consensus estimate for what US short-term interest rates will average for each of the next two years and beyond.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2657" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Federal-reserve.png" alt="Federal reserve" width="521" height="405" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For 2018, the consensus average is 2.00% – 2.25%, which would necessitate four more quarter-point interest rate hikes from the current target of 1.00% - 1.25%. This is the general expectation of the FOMC, although it is always subject to change based on market conditions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there is expected to be no rate hike this Wednesday, the markets will be watching for a potentially more important source of information: language describing the Fed’s intentions to “normalize” its balance sheet going forward. That the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/06/19/fed-rate-hike-and-gold/">Fed is set to normalize its balance</a> sheet was first discussed at the policy meeting in June; however, we have received no tangible information as to how or when the Fed intends to engage in this normalization since.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a reminder, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> sold off strongly on the day that the Fed announced its balance sheet normalization intentions, at the June 14 meeting.</span>
<h3><b>“Normalization” – Say What?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Normalization is a euphemism used by central banks including the Fed: the term is used to describe the selling of bonds and other securities that the Fed has “purchased” since the credit crisis of 2007 – 2009.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall that these bonds – and </span><b>all assets the Fed ever buys – are purchased with freshly created electronic money. </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever the Fed mentions purchasing anything, it is universally talking about printing money and debasing the currency – in other words, creating inflation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is rarely mentioned in mainstream financial publications, as the reality of the situation would be too appalling to discuss in such a forthcoming manner.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, manipulating the prices of assets by purchasing them with newly-created money: this is the only tool that the Fed has ever had.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a reminder of the unprecedented nature of the Fed’s balance sheet, the following chart is reprinted courtesy the Wall Street Journal, which shows the Fed’s holdings from 2004 through the present:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2658" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Building-the-Fed-balance-sheet.png" alt="Building the Fed balance sheet" width="554" height="365" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important point to observe is this: </span><b>it took the Fed from its creation in 1913 through 2008 to accumulate (a.k.a. print) $1 trillion in assets, yet in just the last nine years alone it has printed over $3 trillion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as its balance sheet has grown from $1 trillion to over $4 trillion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second key to recall is that the bulk of the Fed’s purchases have gone toward US treasuries and US mortgages. Is it any wonder that long-term bond and mortgage rates are the lowest they have been since World War II?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fed has completely distorted the very fabric of the financial marketplace, and every piece of the system that sits on top of this distorted base stands to be affected if and when the Fed begins to normalize its balance sheet.</span>
<h3><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2660" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/c_interest.png" alt="c_interest" width="378" height="436" /><b>US Treasury – annual interest expense</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now consider that this near-record interest expense is accumulating when benchmark </span><b>10-year Treasury bonds are at their lowest rates</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in over two generations:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2661" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Long-term-govenrment-Bond-yeild.png" alt="Long term government Bond yield" width="1125" height="433" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, </span><b>the government is paying record high interest when rates are at their lowest in modern history.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Can we imagine if treasury rates simply doubled, back to longer-term averages near 5.0%? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such would mean that the US government’s interest expense would approach $1 trillion per year, assuming no further debt was added into the equation – and of course, new debt keeps being added to the pile each year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What if 10-year yields returned to 7.5%, as they averaged for nearly 25 years from 1970 – 1995?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We must remember, when the Fed states that it intends to normalize its balance sheet, it is saying that </span><b>it intends to sell its recently-purchased treasury bonds, and thus allow interest rates to rise</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Can the Fed realistically be expected to sell much of its balance sheet in the face of record US interest expense, and thus force the government to roll over its debt at higher and higher rates?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The practical answer is: no.</span>
<h3><b>Most Only Know Falling Rates</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us observe: anyone who has been investing in the western world since 1980 knows only falling interest rates as a macroeconomic backdrop. Assuming the average investor begins his or her career at age 22, this means that </span><b>anyone born after 1958 knows only that interest rates keep falling, year after year</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A reversal in 37-years of falling interest rates is what the Fed is proposing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe the Fed has backed itself into a corner, and it will have to renege on its normalization-speak. If it allows interest rates to rise significantly, the central bank will crush the funding mechanism of the US government. If it continues to suppress rates through newly-created money, it will begin to lose credibility as an independent and impartial body.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A loss of confidence in the very institution of central banking in the United States and likely spreading around the western world is the potential if the Fed is not careful.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such will not happen overnight, but the Fed is walking a tight line between its own credibility and the ability of the United States government to fund its operations.</span>
<h3><b>A Third Central Bank Failure?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us not forget: two central banks have already failed in the United States: the First Bank of the United States was dissolved in 1811, and the Second Bank of the United States did not receive a charter renewal in 1836.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Central banking was not present nor required in the United States during the great technological revolutions of the mid-1800’s through early 1900’s, including the implementation of the railroad, the light bulb, the telephone, radio, automobile, and air travel. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Could we be seeing the first warning signs that a third central bank has caught itself in an unsolvable situation and will follow a similar fate as the first two?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In an era of faltering faith in central-bank promises, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> stands to assume its historical function as the premier asset class of last resort – the only financial asset with no counterparty risk and which is nobody else’s liability. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The history books are not written, but the fundamental data points and the quandary the Fed faces are there in plain sight for all to see. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, we watch to observe how the Fed handles its intentions for normalizing its balance sheet at this Wednesday’s meeting, and through the remainder of this year.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you need <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/sell-to-us/diamonds-nyc">to sell your diamond jewelry</a>-it is important to arm yourself with the necessary information before heading to your local jeweler or dealer. Doing the correct research can give you the confidence that you need to get a better price for your valuables.</span>
<h3><strong>Here are some tips to on how to sell your diamond jewelry:</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get a free appraisal from a good jeweler, a professional diamond buyer, or even a pawnbroker in order to give you some insight about what you have. Tell the appraiser the truth about your plans to sell,  so that they can provide you with the most realistic idea of the resale value. Getting free appraisals from two or three different stores will help you get a good idea of how valuable your diamond jewelry actually is.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approach this process without unrealistic expectations about your diamond jewelry. Keep in mind that dealers and jewelers are in this business to make a profit, and if they agree to purchase your jewelry then they, in turn, have to make a profit out of it.Having unrealistic expectations will only lead to disappointment.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Familiarize yourself with the relevant information needed to </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/sell-to-us">sell diamond jewelry</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The basic criteria that all dealers use to grade diamonds are the 4 Cs:</span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Color</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The value of a diamond is determined based on its color. The most valuable diamonds are those without color, as their reflective qualities are superior compared to colored diamonds.  The closer the diamond is towards the no color range, the higher its demand. The exceptions to this rule are pink and blue diamonds, which are far more valuable. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cut</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:   Little known fact: the shape of the diamond is different from the cut. Diamonds come in round, square, and oval shapes, among others.  The cut is the angle and the finish of the diamond, which determines the brilliance of the light reflecting abilities of the stone. Both shape and cut are very important for a valuable diamond. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Clarity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The stones will be measured for their flawlessness. There are two types of flaws a jeweler looks for in a diamond: imperfection and inclusion. Imperfections are scratches on the stone or if the stone is chipped. Inclusions would be an air bubble, other mineral content, or cracks within the diamond. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Carat</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This refers to the weight of the diamond. One carat is equal to 200 milligrams. Don’t confuse </span>karat<span style="font-weight: 400;"> with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">k</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arat. Carat is used to measure the weight of diamonds and other stones, whereas karat is used to measure the weight of precious metals like gold and silver.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best thing you can do is to obtain certification for your diamonds. One of the best certification institutes is the highly trusted GIA or Gemological Institute of America. They won’t be able to help you with a monetary estimate, but they can provide detailed information about the four Cs of your diamonds. With this certification on hand, you will be an educated seller, deterring sellers from quoting you a low price. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get your diamonds and jewelry cleaned professionally before you take them to a buyer.  Smudges and dirt can distract a potential buyer or make it difficult to determine the exact value.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Know your options for where to sell diamond jewelry<span style="font-weight: 400;">. You have many different options. You can take it to a dealer or a jeweler, or you can also sell it online on e-commerce sites such as eBay, or even opt for consignment shops. If you want fast cash, then a jeweler or a dealer is your best option. If you plan to </span>sell diamond jewelry<span style="font-weight: 400;"> online, there are greater risks and it may take time for you to learn how best to sell your products on the different platforms available. This choice is much simpler if you already have experience selling online. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Familiarize yourself with the second entity of your diamond jewelry, the metal that your diamond is bound in. You will need to know the type of metal, its weight, and its karat or purity before you sell it. You will also need to know if the piece is an antique, if it was created by a specific designer or brand, or if the design is particularly rare. If you know that your diamonds are high-quality diamonds devoid of any imperfections or inclusions then they are more valuable out of their settings, as it allows the potential buyer to examine the diamonds freely and you will get a better price. If your diamond has flaws or inclusions which the setting is hiding and the diamond looks better in the setting than it would otherwise,  leave them in place, which may fetch you a better bargain. </span></li>

		<title>Gold is Testing Important Support</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/09/25/gold-is-testing-important-support/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2017 18:17:20 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[juliap]]></dc:creator>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the decline seen in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/">gold</a> prices over the past three weeks, let us update our technical roadmap for the international store of wealth.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the week as a sum, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> closed lower by 2.1% or nearly $28 to finish at $1,291 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the long-term gold chart below, it is critical to note that the precious metal is now coming back into the zone (green shading) to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the broken long-term 2011 – 2017 downtrend (magenta line). Oftentimes, markets will break out of an important technical boundary, only to reverse and revisit that same price zone several weeks or months later. This is what is now occurring in gold.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2732" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Gold-2008-Present.png" alt="Gold 2008-Present" width="1034" height="727" />
<h3><b>Why do Retests Occur?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Retests occur as short-term traders take profits following an important breakout.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a successful scenario, we expect a return to the breakout point to be bought aggressively by second-chance investors – those who missed the initial move, and who now scoop up gold when the market returns to the same price zone.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, in this case, gold broke its declining long-term downtrend at $1,265 back in mid-August. Because the trendline was downward sloping, if gold were to retest the technical breakout today it could fall all the way back to $1,250 without violating the line from the upper side. It is important to know that retests of technical trendlines may indeed occur at lower prices than their original breakout points.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who only view the price in isolation will be missing an important point: a trend change higher is unfolding on the long-term chart.</span>
<h3><b>Short-Term Support Levels</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold</a> could fall back to $1,250 as part of its trendline retest, our highest probability scenario is that it will not fall that low. Instead, we expect a low to form in the $1,283 - $1,301 region, shown below by the green callout.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2733" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Trump-Reversal-Resistance.png" alt="Trump Reversal Resistance" width="1000" height="749" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This expected low is derived from a confluence of important support levels identified in this range. In technical analysis, whenever we see a confluence of support levels within a narrow band, it represents a high probability target scenario. The specific levels are:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,301 – the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the entire July through September rally (light silver line).</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,300 – important horizontal resistance (black dashed line), which held prices lower for most of 2017, and was then decisively broken during the last week of August. When a level which formerly acted as resistance is finally broken, it should then serve as support the next time prices return there, as second-chance buyers look to enter positions, having missed the initial advance.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,283 – the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the entire July through September rally (light silver line).</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, we have three technical support levels within an $18 price region between $1,283 - $1,301, and this represents a high-probability zone for gold to bottom on the present retracement.</span>
<h3><b>Next Up: 2016 Highs</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The actual high two weeks ago was $1,362, and this figure is close enough to the July 2016 peak at $1,378 that we can call this most recent attempt a functional test of the 2016 resistance zone. The retracement that we are now seeing is expected to be the final drop before the next advance brings gold to fresh highs above 2016 levels.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We watch for lows to develop in the $1,283 - $1,301 range as an ideal short-term technical retracement. We encourage investors to use any price points for spot gold in the $1,200’s as final opportunities for accumulation in these ranges. New highs above 2016 levels should be in store for gold by the end of 2017 if prices continue to hold above the now-broken long-term downtrend on any retest.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver</a> is lagging gold on a relative basis, and next week we will focus more in-depth on what to expect for gold’s cousin on the next move.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have not had a good look at <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> in several months, so let us take the opportunity this week to do so.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the stats: for the week ended Friday, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> fell by 1.8% or $0.31 cents, to close at $16.68 as of the final tick for the December futures contract on the New York COMEX. It was the third weekly loss for silver in a row, matching the streak for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>. Silver is down some 8.8% or $1.62 from the recent high of $18.30 in September.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What should we expect going forward? Let us turn to the charts:</span>
<h3><b>Silver Short-Term</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2793" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Flash-Crash-1.png" alt="" width="570" height="515" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If silver continues to falter over the short run, we see minor support near $16.30, at the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the advance starting with the July flash crash lows through the recent peak at $18.30. More important support begins at $16.10 (labeled Initial Support above in black), a level which has held prices higher on five occasions since May 2016. We expect this support zone will hold as <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> now retests its long-term downtrend.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As silver moves higher, significant resistance will still be seen in the region between $18.30 - $19.00, an area representing at least five pivot highs since October 2016. All things considered, we expect sellers to emerge in this region again. This is labeled Primary Resistance on the chart above.</span>
<h3><b>Silver Lagging Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver has been lagging gold since the 2016 peaks for both metals at $21.25 and $1,378, respectively. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In stating this, we are referring to the fact that as of September 2017, gold has come to within 1.2% of its 2016 high at $1,362, while silver has only come to within 14% of its relative 2016 high at $18.30.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, in September silver made a lower high at $18.30 than either of its previous 2017 peaks, both of which just touched $18.50. Meanwhile, gold clearly exceeded its 2017 previous high of $1,295 in September. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Referring back to last week’s article, we continue to expect that gold will exceed its 2016 high on the next rally, either late this year or early 2018. However, our model shows that silver will continue to lag, and not exceed 2016 highs at the same juncture as gold. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Should this lagging be a concern for silver investors?</span>
<h3><b>Silver Underperformance in Perspective</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A common fallacy in the precious metals world is that silver must “confirm” every move in gold, or else the advance in gold is suspect or doomed to failure. We are not sure where this idea originated from, but it is absolutely false when we study the relative performance of both metals at key junctures throughout history.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us consider an example from the past that shares similar technical “basing” characteristics to the current time period for both metals.</span>
<h3><b>2000 – 2004 in Gold and Silver</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver lagged gold notably during the 2000 – 2003 timeframe, as we can observe from the following chart:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2785" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gold-2000-2003.png" alt="Gold 2000-2003" width="537" height="472" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After lengthy bear markets were nearing their terminal stages at the turn of the millennium, notice how gold began to turn upward and finally eclipsed its February 2000 peak at $323 per ounce by December 2002. Meanwhile, silver lagged gold for all of its advance. For example, silver remained well below its related 2000 peak at $5.60 even in December 2002, only reaching $4.85.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Was this underperformance by silver a reason to discount gold’s advance? Or was silver’s lag effect actually an opportunity in disguise for investors who were following the broader market context?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us advance the chart above by one additional year:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2786" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Silver-2011-2017.png" alt="Silver 2011-2017" width="537" height="473" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite lagging for most of the 1999 – 2002 timeframe, silver began to play catch up to gold in early 2003. In fact, silver rose over 90% from the point where our first chart ended in February 2003 through the April 2004 high. During this time, gold advanced only 17%.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors should be aware: most of the “work” in silver investing comes during the waiting. Silver can lag gold for weeks, months, or even years. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when silver does finally begin to catch up, it often does so rapidly and with little warning. The payoff tends to be worth the wait, even if it is frustrating to those with short time horizons.</span>
<h3><b>Expectations for Silver</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite lagging gold recently and our expectation that it may lag for some months further, silver remains in a healthy basing pattern on the long-term chart. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver’s long-term base will eventually be seen to be all price action underneath the key $25/oz level. We expect silver will continue to trade from the mid-teens through the low twenties per ounce for the next 12-24 months, even as gold looks to start a more significant advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During this basing period, metal will be quietly transferred from weak hands to strong.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the basing process completes and silver breaks $25, an entirely new trajectory will begin. But this is likely still 2-3 years into the future.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2794" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Silver.png" alt="" width="566" height="510" />
<h3><b>Takeaway on Silver</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver will play catch up to gold when many least expect it. For now, let us not fall into the trap of assuming that silver underperformance means moves in both metals are suspect. History shows that gold leading silver indicates an early-stage of an emerging advance, not a doomed market.</span>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Christopher, as a bullion dealer, it stands to reason that you'd be bullish on metals.  However, I'm not seeing any underlying principles in your projections to support it.  Do you expect political turmoil in the world, economic uncertainty here in the US, or, maybe, a burst in the stock market bubble, to propel metals forward?  Can you elaborate?
Basing your future projections solely on past statistics is not sound, IMO.  Those fluctuations in the past may have had many different causes that may very well not repeat in the future.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Ronald A,

Thank you for your interest and I appreciate your opinion. Traditionally, we want it or not, there is an inverse relationship between past statistics and future predictions for precious metals.  I expect prices to go up, not because I'm a bullion dealer, but I am also a market analyst, that allows me to explain the science and art of predicting prices. In general, the longer the term for which one would like to predict the prices, the more important are the fundamental issues and look into the previous market's events. As for political turmoil in the world, first, we have to wait until the new Fed Chief will be announced and then it will be more clear should we expect the burst in the stock market bubble or not. Thank you!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold has fallen further over the past week from the correction zone between $1,283 - $1,301 which would have constituted an ideal 38.2% - 50.0% Fibonacci retracement of the July through September advance. However, as discussed in the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/09/25/gold-is-testing-important-support/">gold update</a> two weeks ago, the precious metal could fall all the way back down to $1,240 at this juncture without violating the technical model. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The message of the market remains: <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is retesting the breakout from it's long-term 2011 – 2017 trendline, shown below in the magenta color. The retest zone is now highlighted in green for greater clarity on the intermediate-term chart:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2816" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/a_gold.png" alt="a_gold" width="1061" height="794" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the week as a sum, gold fell nearly $10 or 0.8%, to close at $1,275 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX for the December futures contract.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> bucked the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> trend and finished higher for the week by $0.11 cents or 0.7% to close at $16.79. This represents a falling in the gold to silver ratio (the number of ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold) over the short term.</span>
<h3><b>Lessons from a Falling Gold to Silver Ratio</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The notable action in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> versus gold last week warrants an updated look at this important ratio. (For the chart below, we must switch over to the trading desk because it allows us to view intraday price data, as opposed to COMEX-only price data, as with our usual provider.)</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2817" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/b_ratio.png" alt="b_ratio" width="1108" height="757" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The important points to recall regarding the gold to silver ratio from 2011 through the present:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2011 – 2016 rising channel in the ratio generally corresponded with falling precious metals prices, as gold held its value better on a relative basis. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major 2016 surges in both gold and silver occurred amidst the ratio breaking lower through the rising channel in April 2016, falling from 84 down to 64 ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold by July 2016.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since July 2016, as both metals have corrected in price, the gold to silver ratio has been in a general rising trend again.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the depth of silver’s Flash Crash in July, the ratio peaked at 85, just touching the lower broken boundary of the 2011 – 2016 channel. </span>This was a retest of the broken channel, labeled on the chart, and it represented a spike high – a level which was quickly rejected by the market.</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, the 2011 – 2016 rising channel was decisively broken during 2016’s metals surge. </span><b>This was an important signal of a long-term trend change, of which we are still in the early stages.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect the next major surge in both metals prices to occur when the gold to silver ratio breaks lower from its secondary rising trendline, which is shown on the chart above beginning in July 2016. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, this level would come in at 70 ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Precious Metals Prices This Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If indeed the low for the present retracement has been seen as of Friday with gold touching $1,260 and silver briefly dipping to $16.30, gold will have made a correction that falls still within the valid retest zone of it's long-term 2011 – 2017 downtrend.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The outperformance of silver on Friday is an early positive sign for the sector as a whole.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We continue to expect gold will eclipse its 2016 high of $1,378 on the next primary wave higher, while silver may lag on a relative basis with respect to the time required to break its own high of $21.25. Any such lag in silver should be looked at as an opportunity.</span>

		<title>Gold: Record-Breaking Volume as Base Nears Resolution</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have maintained a target of $1,485 - $1,535 per ounce for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> by the end of 2018 for several months now. This target is based on a measurement of three technical levels which all occur within this $50 swath. As a reminder for new readers of this column, the three target levels we are referring to are:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consolidation from December 2015 through August 2017 featured an amplitude of $330 per ounce, from the low of $1,045 to the high of $1,375. This consolidation took place in the form of a giant triangle on the charts. In technical analysis when a triangle-consolidation break, the target is derived from an equal measurement of the amplitude ($330), added onto the apex of the triangle ($1,205). This calculation gave a target of $1,535. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is clear horizontal resistance visible on the long-term <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> chart at $1,525 (black line). This level formerly acted as support on three occasions in 2011 – 2013 and then failed on the fourth attempt in early 2013. Generally, strong former support levels will subsequently act as intermediate-term resistance on the next attempt to overcome them, as those who previously purchased gold at these higher levels will choose to exit the market at break-even.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire 2011 – 2015 gold decline comes in at $1,485. Fibonacci levels are derived from a pattern which exists in many aspects of nature (such as seashells, hurricanes, and the spirals of the galaxies) called the Fibonacci sequence. Financial markets often follow these similar patterns, the markets being a component of (human) nature.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, when we have a strong confluence of resistance levels within a tight range, this represents a high probability zone for the next target. </span><b>For gold this comes between $1,485 - $1,535.</b>
<h3><b>Record-Breaking Volume a Clue</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, we see clear signs that gold is gaining strength over the short run. As discussed in past articles, gold has already broken it's long-term 2011 – 2017 downtrend. What more, trading volume is picking up, to the extent that Q3 2017 (just closed on September 30) featured </span><b>the highest quarterly volume of gold contracts traded of all time: </b>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2848" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gold-2011-Present.png" alt="Gold 2011-Present" width="566" height="423" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, we can see that this volume surge is occurring still as prices remain at or below 2013 levels. It is often said in a technical analysis that “volume precedes price movement”. These volume spikes are happening now, during the final period of what is still a 5-year basing process (overall flat prices since 2013). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What is shown in these volume spikes is an acceleration in the transfer of gold from weak hands to strong hands, as this base nears its terminal stages?</span>
<h3><b>The Nature of Gold’s Base</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The question surrounding gold’s target remains the timing – and for this we must evaluate the developing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shape</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the ongoing 5-year basing pattern:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2849" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gold-Quarterly-Price.png" alt="Gold Quarterly Price" width="559" height="331" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we can see from the chart, gold’s 5-year basing pattern continues to fit the profile of an early-stage parabolic growth curve, in colloquial terms resembling the “cup” profile (blue). </span><b>The lower range of the early parabolic curve has just been tested with gold’s low price of $1,262 from two Friday’s ago.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Note the blue-callout which points to this location of gold’s recent test of the parabolic curve.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If gold can maintain its early-stage parabolic base pattern (green arrows, above) throughout the remainder of 2017, it argues that our $1,485 - $1,535 target will be reached sooner rather than later, likely by Q2 2018. This may seem improbable for the casual observer of the metals markets, as we have not seen prices that high since early-2013, but it is indeed what is expected given an early-stage parabolic curve which remains unbroken. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If gold fails to maintain this parabolic base (red arrows, above), nothing changes about the target of $1,485 - $1,535. It is only the timing that will change – such will be pushed out toward the end of 2018, possibly to extend into Q1 2019. In sum, in this scenario, more consolidation will need to occur between the recent low of $1,262 and the 2016 peak ($1,378), before gold is ready to advance.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Record-breaking volume is being witnessed coming into the gold market. This is occurring amidst a period of five years in which prices have moved generally sideways as a net sum. The message here is of a market that is picking up interest and nearing the later stages of its basing process.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The remainder of the price action in 2017 will give us strong clues as to how soon our stated target zone will be reached. A continuation of an initial parabolic curve will bring a quicker target, while a breaking of this curve will result in a lengthier consolidation prior to the targets being reached.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us keep our eyes on gold carefully over the next three months.</span>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/06/19/fed-rate-hike-and-gold/">The Fed gathers to set interest rate</a> and monetary policy at its once-per-six weeks meeting: on October 31 – November 1.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Trump is due to announce his candidate for the new Fed chair, and thus by default likely ousting current chairwoman Janet Yellen.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Rate Hike Odds</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the interest rate front, the futures market is pricing in overwhelming odds that there will be no hike at the coming meeting. The odds are 98.5% that the Fed maintains the current target rate, at 1.00% - 1.25%, as seen in the probability chart at right:  </span>

<img class="wp-image-2894 aligncenter" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/a_prob.png" alt="a_prob" width="452" height="294" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, our proprietary Fed-watch indicator, which relies on 3-month US Treasury yields as a leading signal for Fed interest rate hikes, is offering a slightly different perspective. [For context: 3-month yields have generally been rising 1-2 months before each Fed rate hike, as can be seen by the green highlights below.]</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note how although yields are still not back to their short-term July peak, they are indeed steadily rising again (blue callout):</span>

<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2895" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/b_3mo_gold.png" alt="b_3mo_gold" width="579" height="599" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If yields meet or exceed their July peak at 1.15 before December, we predict the Fed will indeed hike by another 0.25% at the December meeting.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The critical point on the above chart is to recall that each Fed rate hike since 2015 (itself the first in a decade) has witnessed a sequentially higher associated <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> price (black arrows, above). Thus, the expectation of another rate hike to come deserves our continued monitoring.</span>
<h3><b>Yellen Out?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chairwoman Yellen’s term is set to expire in February. Reports over the last week from unnamed Fed officials have hinted that Trump may choose to not renew Yellen’s term. The leading replacement candidate is Jerome Powell, who is currently a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2896" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/c_Fedchair-1.png" alt="c_Fedchair (1)" width="624" height="223" />
<h3><b>Yellen to be replaced by Powell?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If Trump indeed chooses to not renew Yellen’s position, it will mark the shortest tenure of a Fed chair since    G. William Miller was ousted by President Carter in 1979 after less than 18 months in office.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Steven Beckner, a Federal Reserve analyst, offered this summary on Miller’s short time in service at the Fed:</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under Arthur Burns, who chaired the Fed from 1970 to 1978, and under G. William Miller, who was chairman… to August 1979, the Fed provided the monetary fuel for an inflation that began as a flicker and grew into a fearsome blaze... If Nixon appointee Burns lit the fire, Miller poured gasoline on it during the administration of President Jimmy Carter. Without question, the most partisan and least respected chairman in the Fed's history, this former Textron executive worked in tandem with fellow Carter appointee, Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal, in pursuit of monetary policies that were expansionist domestically and devaluationist internationally. The goals were to spur employment and exports, with little thought to the dollar's value. By early 1980, inflation was running at 14 percent per year.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">May we then ask: why do reports suggest that Yellen will have the shortest term since Miller, who was responsible for the highest inflation rate in US history? What is occurring inside the central bank to cause Trump’s apparent distrust of Yellen? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A non-renewal after just one term in office is as close to firing a Fed chair as possible without the political embarrassment associated. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Something is not right within the US executive branch / Federal Reserve relationship. We suspect that recent analysis showing a long-term top being put into place in the US dollar is partly related to this instability within the central bank, which may be further expressed within the next two weeks in a Yellen departure announcement.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two central banks have previously been dissolved in the history of the United States. Stay tuned – the lasting success of this institution is not written in stone.</span>

		<title>Gold or Silver – Which One to Choose?</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently I needed to sell some of my long-term precious metals holdings. The reason? To pay for some unforeseen business expenses.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the prospect of selling some physical metals first dawned on me, at first I felt resistance to the idea. How could I sell now, at current prices? What if prices rose after I sold? Would it be better to sell my <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"></a>or <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a>? Maybe I should take out a business loan instead?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These were all questions that arose soon after I began to contemplate the logistics of the transaction. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And they are important questions: after all, some of these precious metals I have been holding for well over a decade.   </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, I decided that I would indeed sell the metals as opposed to taking out a loan. While one could argue that with today’s low-interest rates, I might have been better off locking in a low-rate loan, it felt more sound for me to pay for the expense outright at this juncture. Perhaps the value of keeping life simple is worth more than a specific amount of dollars during certain time periods.</span>
<h3><b>Questions to Ask Oneself</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In completing the transaction, I began to review how many personal factors go into the decision to buy or sell precious metals. In this series of articles, we often focus on macroeconomic trends and price analysis, but there is an equally important number of personal factors that must go into each individual’s investment planning:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, let us consider the simple question of choosing whether to invest primarily in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> or in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> (or <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> or <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">palladium</a> for that matter). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What on the surface seems like it should be a simple question is often found to require a multi-faceted thought process. For example, one must consider:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Does one intend to hold the metals personally, or have them stored in a vault? </b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of holding the metals personally are that one does not have to pay for storage, and no third party ever has a record of the transaction, so privacy is maintained. However, the downsides are that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/how-to/where-to-hide-bullion-home">storage space</a> may be limited, and one’s living space may not be suitable for this. Concerns of theft may also exist. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And indeed, at the present gold to silver ratio of 75-1, the amount of personal space and/or fees required to store $10,000 worth of gold (approximately equivalent to eight 1-ounce coins) is extremely small compared to the space needed to store the same dollar amount of silver (560 1-ounce coins). These practical considerations are paramount for some.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>What are the individual’s risk tolerance and time horizon? </b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold is known to be more stable in value than silver – both when the metals are rising and when they are falling. For example, from the December 2015 low in both metals to the July 2016 highs, gold rose 32%, from $1,045 per ounce to $1,378. Meanwhile, silver rose 56% over the same timeframe, from $13.65 per ounce to $21.25. Clearly a nice outperformance by silver.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, let us consider another time period: 2011 – 2015. From gold’s peak in 2011 at $1,923 to its low over four years later at $1,045, the metal lost 45% of its value. Meanwhile, silver, which peaked at $49 in 2011, lost an incredible 72% in falling down to $13.65.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The point is: in choosing between gold and silver, an individual’s own time horizon and risk tolerance must be weighed. In a rising metals-price backdrop, silver tends to lag gold initially, and then play catch up on a greater percentage basis later in time. It may, therefore, be more appropriate for long-term investors with a higher risk tolerance. However, when the metals fall, gold tends to hold its value more so than silver. Gold provides a buffer to the extreme volatility of silver’s fluctuations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These two broad topics – storage and risk tolerance – are just two of the important issues an investor must ask himself when engaging in physical precious metals transactions. Of course, there are other considerations as well: premiums paid above spot price, taxes, and the ability to easily travel and/or barter with the metals are all factors that may or may not be important for an individual.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, there is never anyone right or wrong answer – the questions lie with the individual. No single plan of action will serve all investors. A realistic examination of one’s own goals and tolerances for risk must be considered:</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Know thyself.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">-Ancient Greek proverb, Temple of Apollo at Delphi</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2954" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/a_Delphi.png" alt="" width="706" height="469" />
<h3><b>Which Did I Choose?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So in the end, which did I end up selling to pay for the business expenses: gold or silver?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not what I prior thought I might have sold in such a situation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While I do have a long-term time horizon, and my risk tolerance is high, I actually choose to sell some silver to raise my funds.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? I’m planning a move in the near future, and the thought of discreetly carrying a few <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold coins</a> with me to my new home was more appealing than transporting a box with hundreds of ounces of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/bars">silver</a> to a new neighborhood.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, this might not have been the right choice for everyone – nor myself even in a different circumstance – but for the present moment, it was right for me.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the end, I felt a sense of gratitude to have had the capital – crystalized in precious metals form – available for when I needed it. Ultimately, I have seen that the disciplined accumulation of capital is one of the most powerful benefits of regularly investing in precious metals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Which do you choose as your precious metal of choice – gold or silver – and why?</span>

Thank you for your opinion. Yes, indeed thousands of dollars can fit the pocket if its gold. That's the right approach. Talking about packaging, you can always manage this question with using different supplies and storage options.  You can check our supplies collection.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I like both gold and silver. But if I had to pick one, it'd be gold simply because of the storage space required is far less than silver. Like stated, several thousands of dollars worth of gold can discreetly fit in a coat pocket or similar. The same can not be said bout silver. Going off topic here, I do think the Perth Mint should consider putting the gold kangaroo coins in mint tubes versus the capsules. The mint tubes are much easier for transport.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Bitcoin Hits $6,500 High for the first time ever.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday saw an all-time high for bitcoin, setting a new record at $6500.00 at the time of writing. Bitcoin has been continually posting record highs of late, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/10/12/bitcoin-hits-time-high/">breaking through $5,300 level</a>, but Wednesday's rise appears to be a new record, based on the price of bitcoin across the US, Japan, South Korea, and Europe.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders suggest this jump was caused by news that the exchange operator CME Group was planning to introduce bitcoin futures.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This year the price rise has been driven by increasing mainstream adoption and awareness of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally. At least 55 cryptocurrency hedge funds have sprung up this year, many of them focusing on bitcoin.  Bitcoin has been rising by over 500% against the dollar this year. However, traders suggest that the main factors affecting Bitcoin surrounding the possibility of the Chinese government, resuming cryptocurrency trading after the reelection of President Xi Jinping later this year, and the strong performance of the Japanese market have contributed to the price surge of bitcoin over the past weeks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin traders are also speculating that this week's bull run is partly helped by a new coming "<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/01/bitcoin-forked-creating-new-bitcoin-cash/">fork</a>" in bitcoin's underlying software.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Differing predictions come from economists, but now may be a good time to report that bitcoin has had a great year. Sure, there have been some ups and downs, but bitcoin has been the clear winner. Furthermore, there have been increasing uses of bitcoin as legal tender around the world, and this trend would lead to hundreds of billions of dollars being allocated into bitcoin in the upcoming years and will allow bitcoin to achieve new highs.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The one-of-a-kind 2016 anniversary edition of the 1 oz. Proof Silver American Eagle Coin will be released by the US Mint on September 16, 2016, at 12 PM, Eastern Time.</span>

<img class="wp-image-743 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-W-1-oz-Proof-Silver-American-Eagle-30th-Anniversary-wBox-COA.jpg" alt="2016-W-1-oz-Proof-Silver-American-Eagle-30th-Anniversary" width="800" height="800" />

<b>Get your unique </b><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/2016-w-1-oz-proof-silver-american-eagle-w-box-coa"><b>2016 1 oz. Proof Silver American Eagle Coin</b></a><b> with smooth, lettered edge celebrating 30</b><b>th</b><b> years of minting excellence!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/government-mints/us-mint"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Mint </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrates 30 years since the release of this exceptional coin. The first Proof American Silver Eagles have been produced in 1986. Since their release up until 1992, the coins carried the “S” mintmark of the San Francisco facility. Between 1993 and 2000, the coins displayed the “P” mintmark, being produced at the Philadelphia facility while starting with 2001 (except for 2009 when the US Mint didn’t issue any Proof Silver Eagles) the coins carry the “W” mintmark and are struck at the West Point facility. The splendid 2016 Proof Silver American Eagle Coin consists of one troy ounce of .999 pure silver, has an exceptional mirror-like finish, comes with the $1 face value, and its weight and purity are guaranteed by the US Government.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the obverse side of the coin is displayed the prize worthy image designed by Adolph A. Weinman, the famous American sculptor-engraver. The image represents the well-known Walking Liberty design which was previously struck on the Walking Liberty Half Dollars and features the Lady Liberty holding laurel and oak branches in her left hand while moving confidently towards the sunlight - the symbol of our Nation’s strength. The graceful full-length figure of Liberty is enveloped in the US Flag’s folds and surrounded by the inscriptions “Liberty”, “In God We Trust”, and “2016”.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-746" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-W-1-oz-Proof-Silver-American-Eagle-back.jpg" alt="2016-W-1-oz-Proof-Silver-American-Eagle-back" width="800" height="800" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reverse design of the Proof Silver American Eagles was created by the former US Mint Chief Sculptor-Engraver, John M. Mercanti, and showcases the image of the majestic heraldic eagle, holding an olive branch in its right talon, arrows in its left talon, a banner with the words “E Pluribus Unum” in its beak and carrying its shield. This representation is the symbol of the preparedness to defend the United States of America, as well as the desire for peace. The thirteen stars symbolizing the thirteen original colonies are displayed above the eagle’s image, which is encircled by the engravings “One Dollar”, “United States of America” and the weight and purity of the coin.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-747" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-W-1-oz-Proof-Silver-American-Eagle-30th-anniversary.jpg" alt="2016-W-1-oz-Proof-Silver-American-Eagle-30th-anniversary-edge" width="800" height="800" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The exclusive feature of the stunning 2016 1 oz. Proof Silver American Eagle Coin is the unique smooth edge with the incused “30</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Anniversary” lettering instead of the regular reeded edge. This splendid anniversary edition is offered by the US Mint in an elegant satin-lined, blue velvet presentation box, accompanied by the special 30</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-anniversary Certificate of Authenticity. Besides having the Proof Silver Eagles in their original packaging, we will also offer you the 30th anniversary coin in Proof 69 (PF69) &amp; Proof 70 (PF70) versions, from both PCGS and NGC, with the designations of Early Release and First Strike, as well as the highly desired First Day of Issue (FDOI) </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/coins/us-silver-coins/certified-silver-eagles"><span style="font-weight: 400;">certified coins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

		<title>Gold Tests Important Trend &amp; Dow / Gold Ratio Update</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/10/04/important-trend-dow-gold-ratio-update/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since the December 2015 bottom in precious metals, gold has risen $272 or 26% from the low of $1,045 per ounce, to close at $1,317 last Friday. From a technical observation, gold is now directly meeting with its rising linear trendline from the absolute lows (shown in blue). This line acted as support to mark the end of the correction in early June. Of course, the line simply represents big buyers who have been showing up in the gold market at increasingly higher levels over the last six months -- and we now want to see if they will show up again this week, just above $1,300.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-783" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_Gold-price-2015-2016.png" alt="gold-price-2015-2016" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

It will be an important test for gold. If the trend channel from the lows is going to hold, it will exert itself within the next 2-3 days, and the price should fail to close below the line for more than one day. This would then set up gold to attempt to break its long-term downtrend (magenta color) by mid-October.

Should the trendline fail -- it will constitute a technical breakdown in the short-term, but all hope will not be lost for the intermediate outlook . The support zone in the region of $1,306 -- which extends down to $1,285 and is shown in green -- has held <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> higher on four separate occasions over the last three months, and it is expected to continue to do so should the linear trend no longer remain in tact.

As investors in the volatile metals, we must expect the prices to move in a series of surges, consolidations, and corrections over the course of the next several years.

Nearing the bottom of the most recent trading range, the mood in the precious metals community has turned decidedly negative in the short-run, despite what has been less than a 5% correction in the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> since late-June. Recent headlines from Bloomberg this week include "Bulls Feeling Frayed as Gold's First-Half Run Fades Into History" and "Gold-Mining Investors hit by the Hitters as Share Rally Sputters".

It is said that corrections can manifest either in price or in time -- and in this case it is clearly happening in the later. Yet no matter which form they take, both price and time corrections serve to set the stage for the next round of advances as weak hands get flushed out of the market and new investors arrive.

When viewing mainstream articles that focus mostly on sentiment, it is helpful to remember that sentiment must necessarily be worst in the terminal stages of a correction, as quotes and headlines come from those who have already sold. And when a critical majority has sold, this is when a bottom in price is imminent.
<h2>Dow / Gold Ratio Update</h2>
The <strong>Dow to Gold ratio</strong> provides an excellent way to view the long-term real value potential for gold relative to the broad US stock market.

As discussed in past articles, the ratio has approached a 1:1 reading twice prior in the last century at precious metals peaks: in 1932 when the Dow crashed to the low 40's and gold was revalued from $20 to $35 per ounce, and again in 1980 when the Dow sat at 850 and gold exceeded $850 per ounce.

We expect that the ratio will hit 1:1 again before this cycle is completed in favor of precious metals.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-784" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/b_Dow-Gold-ratio-long-term.png" alt="dow-gold-ratio-long-term" width="1340" height="737" />

&nbsp;

Updating the analysis, with the Dow at 18,308 as of Friday, September 30 and gold at $1,314 per ounce, the ratio stands at 13.9 : 1. The 1:1 target could thus occur with stocks staying flat and gold approaching $18,000 per ounce, or the Dow falling to 2,500 and gold rising to meet it at $2,500 per ounce. Either way, the result should be over a 90% loss in value in real terms for US stocks before the next precious metals peak occurs.

Although such gains for gold or drops in the Dow may seem extreme given current prices, imagine that the same must have been felt with gold at $35 per ounce and the Dow at 900 in 1968. Yet the two did meet 12 years later.

Presently, the Dow / Gold ratio is in the later stages of a counter-cyclical uptrend, shown by the blue line above, amidst the generational downtrend shown in magenta.

Zooming in above on the counter-cyclical uptrend in favor of stocks since 2011, we see that the advance in the ratio has been halted by the declining long-term downtrend, and is now forming an ugly topping pattern, seen as a bearish-slanted head &amp; shoulders formation in the Dow / Gold Ratio:

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-785" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/c_Dow-Gold-ratio-2012-2016.png" alt="dow-gold-ratio-2012-2016" width="1240" height="737" />

&nbsp;

Once the support of the right shoulder is breached, the intermediate downward target for the pattern is measured at 9.0 on the Dow / Gold ratio, which should correspond to either the loss in value in stocks or the surge in price in gold -- both of which will cause increased attention toward precious metals amongst mainstream investors.

		<title>Gold &amp; Silver Technical Updates</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/10/10/gold-silver-technical-updates/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week gold broke down through both its rising linear trendline and the $1,285 - $1,305 horizontal support that had been supporting <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">prices</a> since the June Brexit vote. By the end of the week gold had closed at $1,257. The importance of these trendlines is apparent as once they were broken to the downside, a cascade of selling was observed in the futures market.

The first point is we must acknowledge the determination of the sellers who showed up each time at the declining long-term (magenta color) downtrend. These long-term trendlines are critical to monitor for exactly the reason that their strength can be so high -- as can be the significance of their eventual breaking.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-794" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_Gold-downtrend-2016.png" alt="gold-downtrend-2016" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

Our best assessment is that the potential for the next low to form will be in the range of $1,200 - $1,251 for gold. Although this is a wide range that is not suitable for short-term trading, there are a confluence of support levels in this region where we place the highest likelihood for a low to now form in gold:
<ul>
 	<li>$,1251 - the 61.8% Fibonacci level of the primary December through July advance.</li>
 	<li>$1,232 - an equal-distance decline of the $$73 amplitude of the June through September consolidation between $1,305 and $1,378.</li>
 	<li>$1,212 - the 50% Fibonacci level of the same advance.</li>
 	<li>$1,200 - horizontal support which held from February through June.</li>
</ul>
When there is a confluence of four technical support levels within such a range, we place a high likelihood for the next intermediate low to form within this price zone.

We should also note that immediately below this support zone is what is labeled "Must Hold Zone" for gold. This region is defined by the 38.2% Fibonacci level of the primary advance at $1,173 and broken October 2015 resistance-turned-support which is appearing near $1,200. This zone represents the lowest possible support for which we could still maintain the thesis that gold is in a new bull market. A break below $1,173 would raise the scenario that gold would form a new low below $1,045 in 2017. We place the probability of this scenario as low at present, but the support region must be mentioned in the course of due diligence.

<strong>Silver Update</strong>

Silver has now come to the lower range of our likely support zone at $17.50, which is also matching the rising linear trendline of the entire advance since the January lows. This further matches closely with the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the advance at $17.42.

The rising linear trendline from the lows has been broken. A recovery of the trend within 1-3 days would constitute a false breakdown in our analysis, but we would need to see <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">prices</a> stabilize above $17.95 by Tuesday for this scenario to manifest.

The bullish posture for silver will remain in tact as long as prices remain above the swing low of $15.85 from June. Such would place the current low at higher than the June low, and maintain the series of higher lows that is essential to the early phases of a new bull market.

We do not have a similar "Must Hold Zone" for <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> as <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is seen to be the primary determinant for the precious metals complex at this juncture.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Chinese Buyers Away Last Week?</strong>

An interesting theory has been circulating that last week's declines in precious metals were purposefully orchestrated to coincide with the ironically-named "Golden Week" period in China. During this semi-annual 7-day holiday, the Chinese financial markets are closed, including the new Shanghai Gold Exchange. As China is still the world's largest consumer of gold, there is merit to the idea that Chinese firms would have withdrawn their bids for physical metal prior to the week, which would have left the market more vulnerable to short sellers.

Ultimately we cannot know the exact extent to which the holiday impacted the losses in the metals last week. We must play the cards we are dealt, and that includes the breakdowns seen over the last several trading days. No matter who did the selling, we want to chart that activity as accurately as possible. My ultimate belief is that any attempts to manipulate markets can only succeed in the short run. The longer a market is suppressed, the more imbalance builds up beneath the system, and like a beach ball held under water, one day it will eventually shoot higher into the air. Throughout history groups have attempted to prop up or suppress one market or another, but they universally fail -- and this time will be no different.

		<title>Gold Predicts Advance in the US Dollar</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/10/17/gold-predicts-advance-us-dollar/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The big driver impacting the precious metals market this past week has been the US dollar. We have been watching this converging wedge formation in the dollar index, a measure of the US dollar versus a basket of foreign currencies, for several months, and this past week the formation broke higher in favor of the dollar (see red highlight circle in the chart below).

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-801" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_gold-price-USD.png" alt="gold-price-usd" width="1240" height="737" />

&nbsp;

As we know, over the short run <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold tends</a> to move inversely to the US dollar.

Interestingly, gold had broken below its $1,305 consolidation support <em>a week before</em> the dollar broke higher from the pattern above. Gold, essentially, anticipated the strengthening of the US dollar prior to it actually occurring.

We can see the inverse correlation between the dollar and gold on the chart below clearly over the last 3 weeks.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-802" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/b_USD-Gold-correlation-october.png" alt="usd-gold-correlation-october" width="838" height="559" />

&nbsp;

Now since October 6, gold has been giving the opposite signal to the preemptive drop from late September. Essentially, gold has moved sideways in a consolidation since that date, even as the dollar has continued to rise.

What gold is saying over the last few weeks is that it doesn't "believe" the dollar's most recent advance is going to last.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Watching for a Top in the US Dollar</strong>

Refer back to the US dollar index chart at the top of the article.

Again, the dollar has broken higher from the wedge consolidation defined by the two converging trendlines since May of this year. Closing at 98 on the dollar index last week, it has been the 3 point move higher from 95 to 98 which has resulted in gold's drop from $1,315 to $1,250.

The dollar is now nearing another test of the 100 level on the index, a measure which has acted as resistance for the last two years.

&nbsp;

We will be watching the action in the US dollar index carefully over the next few weeks. <strong>Should the dollar further levitate toward the 100 resistance zone while gold continues to hold its recent lows, it will be a strong signal that the dollar is putting in a long-term top in this region.</strong> Accordingly, the most recent decline in gold will be seen to be simply the first minor correction in the early phases of a long-term secular advance higher, an advance that ultimately should correspond with a worldwide awakening to the knowledge that all currencies -- not just the US dollar -- are inherently flawed in their present fiat form.

That said, and as we have witnessed, we should expect the most sizeable moves in gold to occur opposite the US dollar, as a weakening in the world's reserve currency will have an outsized impact on the entire world financial system as it is defined in the post-Bretton Woods era.

Let us watch the related moves in the dollar index and gold closely over the next several weeks.
<h2>Gold Analysis</h2>
For the week, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> was up $3 from the Friday prior to close near $1,255 on the New York COMEX exchange.

The historic store of wealth is attempting to stabilize in the strong support zone we have identified below in green. Notably, thus far despite several intraday drops into the zone, buyers have stepped in each time and the precious metals has closed each day above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire December through July advance. This level comes in at $1,251.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-803" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/c_Gold-downtrend-october.png" alt="gold-downtrend-october" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

The higher within the zone of $1,200 - $1,251 that gold can stabilize, the more likely that the long-term downtrend line (magenta color) will be broken on the next series of attempts, which early estimates suggest could occur as early as December.

As technical-based analysts also looking at downside potential, we continue to identify the $1,173 price level as the final "must hold" zone for gold's new bull market. If this level were to breach, it would tell us that -- despite the fundamentals that we know to be true (worldwide central bank money printing, unprecedented low interest rates, unsustainable debt levels) -- another fundamental factor must then be impacting the markets that we must not be fully aware of.

One of the founding principles of our investment philosophy is we cannot possibly know ever factor that is impacting a set market at a given time, because the market is composed of hundreds of millions of individuals, each with their own set of hopes, fears, strengths, weaknesses, assumptions, research, and goals.

Yet to be successful, we do not need to know what each individual is thinking. By paying attention to the sum of the market -- which manifests in the price that is printed each day -- we can align ourselves with the strongest trend as it is occurring.

We have no desire to be right on the fundamentals but wrong on the actual market, a problem which plagues many fundamental-only based investors. As of now, it still appears that the December bottom was an important long-term flexion point... but if anything changes this outlook, we will be sharing it with you here.

		<title>US Dollar and Gold Continue Positive Correlation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The positive correlation we were monitoring last week between the US dollar and the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> has become even more pronounced since the last update. The US dollar, as measured by the Dollar Index, has continued to rise toward medium-term resistance on the charts near the 100 level. Meanwhile, gold is refusing to break down below its recent low of $1,243 set on October 7.

These time periods in which both the US dollar and gold move in the same direction are rare, but not unheard of altogether. They tend to happen during one of two main scenarios:

1) Market panics -- when both assets are viewed as safe-havens, and rise simultaneously (or after the panic ends, when both fall simultaneously).

2) At major inflection points -- when one market is advancing, but the other market does not "believe" the legitimacy of the other market's move.

We see no panic in the stock or currency markets recently, so it appears that as of today, it is gold which is not believing the US dollar's continued advance.

The update below continues from our chart last week, and shows both <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and the US dollar since the recent gold low of $1,243 on October 7 (UUP is the proxy ETF for the US dollar index, GLD the proxy for gold):

&nbsp;

In the absence of a market panic, this simultaneous movement by both gold and the US dollar in the same direction will not last forever.

One of these markets will soon be proven "wrong".

Should the dollar continue to advance toward the 100 level while gold remains firm, the precious metal will be signaling that the dollar is due to put in its final medium-term top of the nearly 2-year consolidation shown below, before the next reversal should take it below 92 into 2017:

&nbsp;

However, should the dollar advance above 100 in a meaningful way, we would need to monitor the action in gold closely, as it could represent a major headwind for the precious metals market for at least the next year.

As of present gold continues to show little respect for the dollar's advance.

Note that on the chart above, the RSI indicator (top section) has once again approached the overbought level above 70, which has marked previous tops in the dollar to within a few weeks through 2015.

Because the dollar is approaching important long-term resistance, we will continue to show the dollar/gold relationship on a regular basis over the coming months. Especially with the possibility of a Fed interest rate hike before the New Year, and with the US election only two weeks away -- the major currency markets are primed for trend-setting action through December.

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Gold Update</u></strong>

As of the New York COMEX close on Friday afternoon, gold had gained $12.20 for the week or nearly 1%, to close at $1,267.70.

Looking ahead, initial resistance will be showing up in the former support zone which was broken during the early October decline, between $1,285 and $1,305. With a high probability, we expect buyers will need at least two distinct attempts to break through this resistance level.

For support, we are looking for gold to continue stabilizing above or within the zone of $1,200 - $1,251, shown below in the green band. If gold can maintain the recent October 7 low of $1,243 as the bottom for this correction, it will be setting up a bullish posture to overcome the declining long-term downtrend (magenta color) as early as December, and at latest by March.

We continue to believe the overcoming of this long-term downtrend will represent a major shifting point in the psychology of the precious metals market, and should precede a significant dollar-negative event by 6-12 months.

We note that the RSI indicator (top of chart) had become the most oversold since just prior to the December 2015 bottom. In a bull market, RSI readings below 30 generally signify medium-term bottoms, although this does not preclude the possibility of further time needed within the support zone over the coming months.

As the US election is just over two weeks away, during the next two weeks we will have increased commentary on how the election results may impact the markets, most notably the US stock market, and of course the precious metals.

		<title>Americans Wary of Both Candidates - How Will Markets Respond?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The US election is only eight days away, and the race has tightened over the last week. While Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton remains ahead in most polls, Republican candidate Donald Trump has recently taken the lead in key swing states such as Florida and Ohio.

Our general stance on the election is largely agnostic. We are not hugely fond of either candidate. Trump certainly would be a wild-card should he be elected, while Clinton would likely remain more tied to the existing political establishment, continuing the general trajectory of most of Obama's initiatives of the last eight years.

Yet from our viewpoint, it is not so much which candidate ends up winning the election, but rather the recent polls showing Americans' negative sentiment toward both candidates which is most noteworthy.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone wp-image-865 size-full" title="clinton-trump-unfavorable-rating" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_clinton-trump-unforable-rating.png" alt="a_clinton-trump-unfavorable-rating" width="650" height="596" />

&nbsp;

Indeed, polls released this week show that <strong>for the first time ever, the majority of Americans view both candidates as "unfavorable".</strong> (Note: the most recent percentages are now higher than even the chart above shows, at 52.4% unfavorable rating for Clinton and 59.1% for Trump.)

The level of distrust amongst Americans toward their politicians is at an all-time high.

As a corollary, it is fascinating to note that Americans' trust of the mass media is also now at multi-decade lows. The most recent 2016 poll from Gallup shows that the percentage of Americans who have "trust and confidence" in what they are told from mainstream news outlets has fallen to just 32%.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/b_Americans-trust-mass-media-chart.png" alt="b_americans-trust-mass-media-chart" width="600" height="370" />

&nbsp;

Something unprecedented is happening here both politically and culturally. This is at least one reason to hold some physical precious metals outside the banking system, regardless of what happens to the prices in the near term.

&nbsp;

<strong>Markets and Elections</strong>

Historically speaking, since 1900 the data we have available does show that democratic Presidents correspond to better performances in the broad stock market over their terms in office, statistically higher than the performance seen with republican Presidents, as shown in the chart below.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-867" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/c_DJIA-stock-market-change-president.png" alt="c_djia-stock-market-change-president" width="1067" height="1136" />

&nbsp;

However, correlation certainly does not equal causation.

For example, the data does not take into account the myriad of other factors that could have impacted the market averages over these years, such as central bank policies, debt accumulation due to war, or the bursting of market bubbles.

The data is also only expressed in nominal terms. When inflation-adjusted or priced in gold, the data would reveal quite different results.

We also know that there are delays as new policies work their way into an economy. Could higher stock market performances in certain years came as a result of policies implemented in prior administrations?

We cannot know any of this for certain. What we can do is observe the correlation and attempt to decipher what it will mean going forward: democrats do tend to see better stock market performances during their years in office.

&nbsp;

<strong>The Election and Precious Metals</strong>

Turning our attention to precious metals and the election outcome, let us first consider the above-mentioned factor concerning higher stock prices under democratic Presidents. Because stocks and gold are often (but not always) counter-cyclical assets, broadly speaking we can surmise that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> should be expected to perform better under a republican President.

We can observe that the two most significant bull markets in precious metals over the last 50 years began under two republican Presidents: the 1971 - 1980 advance of 2,400% in gold began under republican President Nixon, and the 2001 - 2011 advance of 760% in gold began under President Bush II.

Yet we must recall that the seeds of these precious metals bull markets were sown in the years prior to the republicans taking office, as unsustainable debt and currency depreciation during the prior years eventually forced a revaluation higher in the world's ultimate monetary reserve: gold.

Again, just as we are hesitant to give sole credit to democrats for outperformance of the stock market, we cannot give sole credit to republicans for outperformance of the gold market.

&nbsp;

<strong>The Brexit Effect</strong>

In the coming election, a Trump victory would clearly be a wild-card outcome, as it is not something seen likely in current electoral polls.

Essentially, we believe most markets are siding with the polls and "pricing in" a Clinton victory.

However, markets -- and polls -- are not always correct.

As we saw in Britain with the June Brexit decision in which polls prior to the vote still hinted that the UK would not leave the EU, markets can indeed be fooled.

Since a Clinton victory is already priced in, a Trump surprise win would be a shock for most major stock and currency markets.

As such, we contend that a surprise Trump victory might cause a spike in gold similar to the $110 intraday surge seen on June 24 as votes were being tallied in Britain. Yet this time, the gold spike, should the markets get this surprise, would come not from a falling British pound, but instead from a falling US dollar and/or US stock market.

&nbsp;

<strong>How Will Americans Express Their Distrust?</strong>

No matter who ends up winning the American election on November 8, the most critical trend to follow is the general population that now distrusts <em>both</em> primary candidates and also the mainstream media.

To use the analogy of the popular game, there are not too many dominos that need to fall between the majority of Americans distrusting their government leaders, and at least a portion of those Americans deciding to vote with their wallets and to buy a modest allotment of <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> or <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>.

If you can't trust the President, and you can't trust the media, who can you trust?

It is estimated that still today, only 1% of Americans own any precious metals whatsoever.

Can we begin to fathom what would happen to prices if that percentage were to double, to say 2%? What if 10% of Americans wanted to have 10% of their net worth in gold and silver?

The fundamentals behind this sort of movement into the only asset outside of government control are as strong as they could possibly be. The key question remains timing. It is still early in this cycle. When will more people wake up?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last autumn month brings you the 3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coin - the </span><b>2016 Walking Liberty Half Dollar Centennial Gold Coin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - completing the highly anticipated </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins/us-commemorative-coins/2016-centennial"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centennial series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the US Mint. Commemorating 100 years since the coin’s first mintage, this gorgeous anniversary edition will be offered for sale on November 17</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at 12 noon ET and is expected to sell out quickly, as the previous issues of the series.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-874" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-1-2-oz-Walking-Liberty-Centennial-Gold-Coin-1916-2016-100th-Anniversary.jpg" alt="2016-1-2-oz-walking-liberty-centennial-gold-coin-1916-2016-100th-anniversary" width="800" height="700" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Celebrating 100 years of excellence in the mintage of three iconic 1916 designs, the </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/government-mints/us-mint"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Mint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued the following 2016 renditions of the highly regarded coins:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/2016-1-10-oz-mercury-dime-centennial-gold-coin-100th-anniversary-w-box-coa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury Dime Centennial Gold Coin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (April)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/2016-1-4-oz-standing-liberty-centennial-100th-anniversary-w-box-coa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Standing Liberty Quarter Centennial Gold Coin </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(September)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/2016-1-2-oz-walking-liberty-centennial-100th-anniversary-w-box-coa"><b>The Walking Liberty Half Dollar Centennial Gold Coin</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (available on 17</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> November)</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of these highly anticipated gold collectibles are treasured additions for any numismatist due to their legendary design struck with exceptional craftsmanship by the US Mint professionals. These splendid gold coins have borrowed the original designs of the 1916 circulating coins, honoring the remarkable work of their creators and refining them with stunning business strike finishes.</span>

<img class="wp-image-878 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-1-2-oz-Walking-Liberty-Centennial-Gold-Coin-back.jpg" alt="2016-1-2-oz-walking-liberty-centennial-gold-coin-1916-2016-100th-anniversary" width="800" height="700" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the reverse and obverse sides of the coin showcase the basic design of the iconic Walking Liberty minted from 1916 to 1947 and reconstituted on the extremely popular American Silver Eagle coin, produced from 1986. The images are courtesy of the famous American sculptor, Adolph A. Weinman, whose “W” initial has been added to the coin’s head (one of the few differences between the centennial and original coins). On the obverse side is engraved the graceful full-length figure of Lady Liberty, displayed in full stride and enveloped in the United States flag’s folds. She is depicted as holding branches of laurel and oak in her left hand and having her right arm extended, encircled by the engravings “Liberty”, “In God We Trust”, and “2016”.  On the reverse side is represented the majestic American eagle which is rising from a top perch of a mountain, framed by the inscriptions “Half Dollar”, “E Pluribus Unum”, “United States of America”, along with the “W” mintmark, purity and weight of the coin (another unique feature of the anniversary edition).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This astonishing coin will be re-struck at the US Mint West Point Facility from ½ troy ounce of 99.99% pure (24 Karat) gold and will come with business strike finish and reeded edge. The half-ounce size is representative to the centennial coin’s denomination of half a dollar. The 2016 Walking Liberty Half Dollar Centennial Gold Coin has a limited mintage of just 70,000 pieces (lower than the limits for the previous centennial coin issues) and a 3-coin household order limit. Each coin will be individually encapsulated and displayed by the mint in a hand-packed and custom-designed elegant black matte hardwood presentation case which will contain the coin’s Certificate of Authenticity.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-879" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-half-oz-Walking-Liberty-Centennial-Gold-Coin-with-Box.jpg" alt="2016-half-oz-walking-liberty-centennial-gold-coin-with-box" width="800" height="700" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first centennial edition – the 2016 Mercury Dime Gold Coin – sold out in less than one hour and the mint offers only a few of the 2016 Standing Liberty Quarter Centennial Gold Coins. The low issue of the centennial Walking Liberty promises that this thrilling coin will also be a sought-after keepsake, so don’t miss your chance to own the last issue of the series.</span>

		<title>Gold &amp; Silver Technical Updates. The Presidential Election</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With no change announced to interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve meeting this week, the markets instead focused mostly on the upcoming <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/10/31/americans-wary-candidates-how-will-markets-respond/">US election</a>. Polls continued to show the gap between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton narrowing, now to 1.6%. The correlation between gold and Trump's poll odds has been striking over the last two weeks... and one way or another, the question as to who will lead the United States for the next four years will be decided this Tuesday.
<h2>Gold</h2>
In sum, gold rose this week by $27 to close at $1,304, a gain of 2.2% from a week prior.

As emotions can become extreme at such critical fundamental crossroads, we find it useful to return our attention at these moments to the charts for what is always the primary driver for the entire precious metals complex: the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">price of gold</a>.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-887" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Gold-price-elections.png" alt="gold-price-elections" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

The language of the charts shows us that gold is now directly hitting up against the upper boundary of the broken support zone which held it higher from June through early October, at $1,305.

It would be rare for a market to break down from such a support zone (as happened in October) and then recover it on the first attempt higher, so we would expect to see gold back off in this region, and spend more weeks consolidating between the support established in at $1,245 and the recent high of $1,305. This would then set gold up to make a second attempt to break $1,305 later this year or early 2017. This is what markets "should" do from a technical perspective.

However, a Trump victory would certainly be one of those fundamental triggers that could cause a major breakout on the chart pattern prior to our typical expectation.

For now, we will have to step back and watch the outcome this week. The trading on Tuesday should be fascinating to observe. Whether it is sooner or later, the support and resistance zones that will define the next stages of gold's trajectory are clearly defined, and the most important question we continue to monitor is: "When will gold break its long-term downtrend?"

That break is going to coincide with a fundamental spark that will reveal itself just at the right time. Again, the charts can give us great insight into "what" is happening... the "why" always remains to be seen.

&nbsp;
<h2>Silver</h2>
Silver finished higher for the week by $0.58 cents to close at $18.37, a gain of 3.2%, although well off the high of $18.75 hit on Wednesday.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-888" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Silver-price-elections.png" alt="silver-price-elections" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

As we can see above, silver got stopped in its tracks just above $18.50, the former support seen in late August. From a technical perspective over the short term, $18.50 matches very closely with the $1,305 resistance in gold. A break and sustained close of either of these levels by either metal would give us a strong indication of a breakout to come in the other.

Strong support for <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver price</a> exists between $17.00 and $17.40.

The critical test for silver is that we observe when it breaks the downtrend shown above in blue. We continue to believe <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> will break this trend line within the same timeframe as gold's break of its long-term downtrend (magenta color, page 1).

<strong> </strong>

<strong>A Note on the Fed Statement</strong>

As referenced above, the Fed meeting was generally a non-event this week. However, the language used by the Fed in the non-decision strongly hinted that a second rate hike is due to come, perhaps as early as December:

"<em>Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. </em><strong><em>The Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives</em></strong><em>. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."</em>

This point bears repeating, as the misinformation from the mainstream media is constant and is repeated in almost every major Fed interest rate article: throughout history rising interest rates have corresponded with rising gold prices, not the opposite, as the mainstream press often states.

What we are now witnessing is the very beginning of the <u>slowest</u> rate-hike cycle the Fed has ever engaged in.

Typically over the last 70 years during rate hike cycles, the Fed would raise 0.25% every meeting over the course of 3-5 years. Such was the case, for example, from 2003-2007 as the Fed raised rates from 1% to 5.25% in 0.25% increments, every 6-12 weeks.

Yet during the current cycle, the Fed has raised rates only <u>once</u>, and it has now paused for a full year since that singular rate hike in December 2015. This is the only time in history the Fed has raised rates once, and then paused for the next year. We are witnessing a slow-motion collision course between unsustainable debt levels that cannot afford higher interest rates, and a wave of inflation that is already working its way into various segments of the economy.

Newton's Third Law says: "For every action there is an opposite and equal reaction." The unprecedented interest rate policy we are living through is going to have unprecedented consequences, it is only a question of timing.

		<title>Trump&#039;s Unexpected Victory, Markets Reverse Course</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Donald Trump clinched an unexpected victory for the US Presidential election on Tuesday, which sent major world markets into a temporary panic.  Gold surged, stocks dropped limit-down in the overnight hours, and it appeared gold was on the verge of the technical breakout from the long-term downtrend that we have been monitoring for almost half a year now.

Yet just 12 hours after the election results became known, the markets saw quick reversals of the prior movements, with precious metals and other safety assets being dumped, and risk assets including broad stocks and industrial commodities being bought strongly.

We remain long-term bullish on precious metals for the fundamental reasons that we all know to be true: central bank money printing, government bailouts of private corporations, uncontrollable debt, and negative interest rates in several major nations worldwide.

Yet the challenge at this moment is to come back to a central investment principle: do not fight the market.

What this means is that, as individuals and investors, we may have opinions on what the market should do. We may have fundamental data from sound research to back up those opinions. We may have done thorough due diligence. Yet despite all this, if the market moves opposite to our fundamental research, we must consider that there is more information impacting the market than we are factoring into our equations.

The old investment adage is helpful to remember: "The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."
<h2>Markets Turn After Trump's Victory</h2>
Immediately in the aftermath of the Trump election victory, most major world markets reversed course abruptly and strongly.

Gold and silver, which were up significantly in the hours after Trump's win was decided, reversed suddenly and finished lower for the week. Gold hit a high of $1,335 in the early morning hours on Wednesday, only to close the week near $1,225, almost a $110 drop in just over 48 hours.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-903" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a_TrumpVictory-stocks-dollar-gold-silver.jpg" alt="trump-victory-stocks-dollar-gold-silver" width="1500" height="1125" />

&nbsp;

Similarly, the US dollar and the US stock market, which were showing 2.5% and 5% losses in the overnight hours after the election, reversed course and both finished higher by over 1%, respectively. These are notable intra-week swings.

But it was not only gold and precious metals that fell after the initial surge on Tuesday night. Long-term 20+ year US bonds also dropped, falling over 6% in the last three trading days of the week. This is a huge drop for the bond market, to the extent that 20-year interest rates rose from 2.26% to 2.58% in just one week. This is one of the largest single-week drops in bond prices / increase in bond interest rates seen in the last 20 years.

In sum, after the initial fear reaction as a result of Trump's victory, most major markets did a 180-degree turn and reversed. Safety assets were sold across the board, and risk assets recovered to turn positive.

Let us switch the above chart to view the action in metals only. We are including both precious and industrial metals in the following chart.

&nbsp;

First, we see that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-copper">copper</a> was the outstanding performer this week, indicating demand for the industrial metals was seen as positive after the Trump election. <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">Palladium</a> came in second, which is, of course, a precious metal with major industrial demand, especially from the automotive industry.

In contrast, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> all fell, the first two being the historic monetary metals.

It appears that markets are pricing in increased industrial demand from the Trump administration and a lesser need for safety assets. We can only speculate as to the reasons for this -- we wonder (half-jokingly): is the wall that Trump intends to build along the US-Mexico border going to be made primarily of copper?

Silver is the outlier. As we know, silver's demand equation still is composed of roughly 80% industrial usage. Why did silver fall more than gold, and not finish the week somewhere in between gold and copper (as it "should" when safety assets fall but industrial assets rise)? What happened to the industrial silver buyers?

Manipulation theories aside (we do not completely discount them, but do not consider them sufficient for making investment decisions), based on the declines seen in US bonds, gold, and platinum, we can only conclude that silver saw large selling from those who were previously holding the metal for its safety / monetary role. We may not agree with their decision to sell, but sell is what they did.

A quick view of the copper chart from 2010 through present reveals the significance of the surge seen in the primary-industrial metal this week: no less than a breakout from the long-term declining trendline since the 2011 highs. [Note: this is the same relative trendline that has been so elusive for gold, from which it has failed to break higher for the past five months. From the copper surge seen this week it should be apparent why we place emphasis on the potential breaking of these long-term trends.]

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-905" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/c_Copper-spot-price-elections.png" alt="copper-spot-price-elections" width="1067" height="799" />

&nbsp;

In sum, copper was up an incredible 10.7% for the week and looks like it is entering a new bull market after five years of declines.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold Analysis</h2>
For the week, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price per ounce</a> fell $80 or 6.1% to finish at $1,224. Yet more significant was the nearly $110 swing from $1,335 on Wednesday to the Friday close.

<strong>The Wednesday reversal consisted of the highest ever single-day volume of contracts traded on the New York COMEX exchange, at 780,000.</strong> This is nearly four times the average daily volume.

Because this historic volume occurred on a reversal day, the $1,335 high is going to require multiple attempts or an equally-high record-breaking volume surge to break through this level on any subsequent rally.

Viewing gold technically, the metal is making a lower low within the strong support zone that we would expect to hold if gold is still in a new bull market. This zone extends down to $1,200, precisely.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-906" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/d_gold-spot-price-elections.png" alt="d_gold-spot-price-elections" width="1125" height="843" />

&nbsp;

The "Must Hold Zone", as defined by $1,173, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the advance, would be the lowest level that we have observed new bull markets to fall while still being in a primary overall advance. A break below that level and quick retests of $1,045 would occur at minimum.

		<title>Gold in Foreign Currencies - Clues to Gold in US Dollars</title>
		<link>https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/12/19/gold-foreign-currencies-clues-gold-us-dollars/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Given the potential for the pending low we are expecting across the precious metals in the next 2-3 months, it is important that we review gold priced in other major world currencies at this juncture.

If gold is going to form a bottom in US dollars, it is going to form concurrent bottoms at different but related key technical zones in other currencies during the same timeframe.

Conversely, if we observe major breakdowns in key technical levels in gold as priced in foreign currencies, it would give us clues that US dollar gold may be heading for new lows.

Although <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold priced in US dollars</a> is the worldwide standard for both trade and mining valuation, the bull market that we are expecting over the coming years is believed to be a worldwide phenomenon. Whereas in the 1970's gold's advance was mostly related to US dollar weakness after President Nixon severed the link to gold, today every currency in the world is fiat, and we have observed the precious metal moving higher over the last decade in multiple currencies.

This situation of not having a single currency backed by <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, in and of itself, is unprecedented, and so we now turn to gold as priced in four other major currencies for perspective on the faith (or lack thereof) other western citizens are placing in their own central bank's regimes.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold in Canadian Dollars (CAD)</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1042 size-full" title="Gold in Canadian Dollars (CAD)" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/a_Gold-in-Canadian-Dollars-CAD.png" alt="a_Gold in Canadian Dollars (CAD)" width="1223" height="727" />

Gold in Canadian dollars hit a high of just over $1,800 over in the summer, with a second attempt to break this level negated following Trump's victory.

Canadian dollar-gold has since given back nearly $300 to close just above $1,515 this week.

The critical technical position of gold in Canadian dollars is evident on the chart above by the long-term (magenta color) trendline that is now being tested. This test represents the second distinct hit on the trendline since breaking the 2011-2014 downtrend in mid-2014 (red callout, above). This trendline dates all the way back to 2005.

We can observe a fairly uniform rising channel having formed since CAD gold bottomed in 2013 at $1,250, with four successive higher highs and four successive higher lows since then.

If gold were to break down through the long-term trendline, it would give us reason for additional caution on US dollar gold.

If gold in US dollars is going to form the interim low we expect in early 2017, gold in Canadian dollars should hold its long-term rising trendline immediately and exceed $1,800 by 2018.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold in British Pounds (GBP)</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1043" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/b_Gold-in-British-Pounds-GBP.png" alt="Gold in British Pounds (GBP)" width="1204" height="715" />

Gold in British pounds had bottomed at £700 in late 2015, before the 2016 advance reached over £1,050 post-Brexit. Since the US election, British pound-gold has given back £150 to close just above £900.

Gold in pounds is now retesting its Brexit breakout point at £900. This is the price below which the metal consolidated for most of 2016 prior to the vote.

From a technical perspective, we would expect to see second-chance buyers in the UK step in between £850 - £900 for an interim low.

If gold in US dollars is to form a double bottom in 2017 and then begin a new bull market, we expect, based on the ongoing weakness across pound sterling exchange rates, that gold in GBP will make new all-time highs as early as 2018.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold in Euros (EUR)</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1044" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/c_Gold-in-Euros-EUR.png" alt="Gold in Euros (EUR)" width="1208" height="718" />

Gold in euros bears many similarities in trajectory to gold in Canadian dollars, yet with the swings in each direction since 2013 showing lesser volatility. Euro-gold bottomed in 2013 at just above €860, broke its downtrend from the 2012 high in January 2016, and has since formed a rising trend channel similar to that seen in CAD gold.

Since hitting €1,250 in July, euro-gold has come back into the middle of its rising trend channel just below €1,100. We will want to see this long-term (magenta color) lower trendline hold for an interim low, with a higher high to form sequentially by 2018 above €1,250.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold in Australian Dollars (AUD)</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1045" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/d_Gold-in-Australian-Dollars-AUD.png" alt="Gold in Australian Dollars (AUD)" width="1202" height="715" />

Gold as priced in Australian dollars is unique in that the price actually broke down in early 2013 from its long-term rising trendline, shown by the red highlight. Since then, AUD gold has formed a cup consolidation, retesting the 2011 high at $1,800 last summer.

<img class="alignright wp-image-1046" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/e_AUD-gold-Cup-Handle.png" alt="AUD gold Cup Handle" width="437" height="387" />

Notably, AUD gold has failed to regain the broken trendline on five separate occasions since 2013 (red arrows). In technical analysis, broken support often becomes resistance, even in a trending market.

Yet the decline from the recent high down to $1,550 still fits in with the model of a consolidation. In this model, we are looking at a cup and handle continuation pattern, which, as shown in textbook example to the right, is derived from a tea cup setting of the same name.

Should AUD gold make a new all-time high above $1,800, it would be an early-warning signal that gold in other western currencies may be headed in that direction within a few years. (It is quite possible for a long-term trendline to break as it has for AUD gold, but for the market to continue on to new highs, albeit at a lesser rate of acceleration.)

A break below the $1,300 level would indicate the likelihood of a long-term double top at $1,800.

At present, the action between $1,300 and $1,800 must be viewed as consolidative in nature until one of those levels is broken.

This article will reveal the top 10 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best gold coins to buy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2017. From the Nation’s beloved Gold Eagles and Buffalos to top-selling foreign gold pieces, you will find the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best way to buy gold coins</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and make thoughtful investment decisions.</span>
<h2><b>Top 10 </b><b>Best Gold Coins to Invest to</b><b> in 2017:</b></h2>
<h3>1) American Eagle 1 oz. Gold Coin</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most highly anticipated coin of each year, the American Gold Eagle is a classic addition to your coin portfolio. This beautiful coin series has proved to be a symbol of the Nation’s greatest values of patriotism, freedom, and equality. It’s legendary Lady Liberty, and bald eagle design makes it an essential keepsake for any investor or collector and a highly liquid asset.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although its gold purity is only .9167, the American Eagle 1 oz. Gold Coin is the single exception approved to be included in a Precious Metals IRA. The US Mint also offers the coin in rolls and monster boxes, making it an excellent option for bulk investments. The</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-1-oz-gold-american-eagle-bu"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">BU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-w-1-oz-proof-gold-american-eagle-box-coa"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">proof coins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are already ready to be purchased in original mint packaging, as well as in certified cases from NGC and PCGS.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1683" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gold-American-Eagle-300x300.jpg" alt="Gold American Eagle" width="300" height="300" />
<h3>2) American Buffalo Gold Coin</h3>

This series has been introduced by the US Mint to compete with highly pure foreign gold coins, such as the Gold Britannia or the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf. However, this stunning coin became tremendously popular because it’s a rendition of the famous 1913 Buffalo Nickel.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It features on its obverse side the magnificent profile portrait of a Native American while on its reverse is depicted the majestic American Buffalo inspired by the Black Diamond Bison that lived in the Central Park Zoo in 1910. Its high fineness and beloved design make it a treasured addition for any investor or collector.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1673" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Buffalo-300x300.jpg" alt="American Buffalo" width="300" height="300" />
<h3>3) Canadian Maple Leaf 1 oz. Gold Coin</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">RCM’s beloved</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-1-oz-canadian-gold-maple-leaf-bu"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Canadian Maple Leaf 1 oz.

Its renowned maple leaf reverse design is a world-famous symbol of the Canadian historical heritage, and along with its .9999 gold purity makes this superb coin a must-have for any passionate numismatist and a great choice for IRA savings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Canadian Maple Leaf 1 oz. Gold Coin is also favored for its exclusive bullion security enhancements: the micro-engraved leaf privy mark with the last two digits of the mintage year, the radial lines light-diffracting background pattern, and the Bullion DNA anti-counterfeiting technology. Due to its high-tech innovative security features, this coin is basically impossible to be counterfeited, for which many investors chose it over other options. RCM also offers this fantastic coin with various privy marks, as well as in rolls and monster boxes.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1674" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Canadian-Maple-300x300.jpg" alt="Canadian Maple" width="300" height="300" />
<h3>4) British Britannia Gold Coin</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The meaningful</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-great-britain-1-oz-gold-britannia-bu"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">British Britannia Gold Coin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a renowned international gold bullion coin. In 2017, this splendid piece celebrates its 30</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anniversary since the Royal Mint first released it in 1987. The mint issued a </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-great-britain-1-oz-gold-britannia-30th-anniversary-coin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">special privy mark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gold Britannia to commemorate this event.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This outstanding coin showcases on its reverse side the confident figure of Britannia who is the personification of the British Isles since the 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century.

		<title>15 Most Valuable US Coins</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Coins are valued by consumers for various reasons: investment, aesthetic appeal, numismatic value for collectors, and gifting are the top few. The value of a coin is directly related to how much it weighs, its content, purity, age and most importantly, its rarity. It is possible for a rare copper coin minted in the 19th century to be far more valuable than its intrinsic value but, the value of another similar coin would be a lot less if it is old but it is commonly available. A .9999 gold coin minted this year probably has approximately same value as its intrinsic value but it would be a lot more valuable if it is a limited release of a popular coin series, and is expected to be sold out soon.

<strong>Here is list of the 15 most valuable US coins:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li><b>1794 Silver Dollar </b>
Owning this “Flowing Hair Silver Dollar” minted in 1794 would be a dream come true for any serious numismatist. This rare beauty with her flowing hair has fascinated the numismatic world to such an extent that the coin was sold at an auction conducted by Stack’s Bowers Galleries for an astounding $10 million in 2013. That was a new world record price for any coin. The coin’s mintage was minuscule but was used heavily in circulation and served as a face of the young United States to the world outside. This is a popular image of the 18th century America.
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1771" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1794-Silver-Dollar-1.jpg" alt="" width="471" height="263" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li><b>   1804 Ten Dollar Gold Piece </b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In total only ten of these coins were produced, out of which currently only three are known to exist. Similar to the 1804 Silver Dollar, these coins were also minted in 1834, but dated as 1804. The only auctioned coin was from the King of Siam set and was sold for $8.5 million in 2005.</span>

<ol start="3">
 	<li><b> 1933 Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle </b></li>
</ol>
Although 445,500 Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle coins were minted in 1933, today only a handful of coins are available making this collection highly  rare and valuable. These coins were never released for circulation due to Frank Roosevelt’s executive order suspending gold coinage and confiscating all gold coins in circulation for melting. Only 20 coins were saved from melting process as they were stolen and sold to the collectors. The secret services could recover 19 of them out of which 9 were melted. Nowdays, only a handful  coins remain and they are highly valuable today. One coin was bought by a private owner for a colossal sum of US$7.59 million in 2002.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1773" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1933-Saint-Gaudnes-300x168.jpg" alt="1933 Saint Gaudnes" width="432" height="243" />
<ol start="4">
 	<li><b>  1804 Silver Dollar </b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This coin has the limelight for its rarity and for the well-known fact,that it was sold for a whopping $4.14 million at an auction. There are only 15  coins available in the entire world and the interesting part is none of these coins were actually minted in 1804. All the coins were either minted in 1830 or later. The elegantly draped bust and bowed head Liberty is a design that all numismatists will want to own. The coin's rarity, beauty, and design is extremely popular in the numismatic world. </span>

<ol start="5">
 	<li><b>1870-S Three Dollar Gold Piece  </b>
This coin was produced from 1854-1889 and designed by James B. Longacre. The 1870’s coins are considered to be one of the rarest on the marketplace as only two of these 1870-S Three Dollar Gold Piece were known to be struck and only one is known saved now. Its believed that only one such coin existed and that it was struck to be placed in the cornerstone of the U.S. Mint building in San Francisco. The coin was minted using a special cast and has unique hand carved “S” mark. The coin is hold in the American Numismatic Association Museum in Colorado Springs  and its value is $4 million.
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1808" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1870-s-3-Dollars-300x149.jpg" alt="1870-s 3 Dollars" width="422" height="210" /></li>
 	<li><b>1849 Coronet Double Eagle </b></li>
</ol>
The Double Eagle is a one-of-the-kind coin, which mintage was inspired by the 1848 California Gold Rush, and changed the history of American Coinage forever. Till 1849 the highest coin denomination was $10, but the Gold Rush led to an abundant influx of gold into the US Mint, and hence an idea to produce a higher coin denomination. In 1849 only two pieces of Double Eagle coins were produced in proof condition, one of them is stored at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. and the whereabouts of the other coin is unknown. Many numismatics believe that if the coin was available its value would be $4 million. The coin was designed by James B. Longacre and features a profile portrait of Liberty wearing a small coronet.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

7. <b>1907 Ultra-High-Relief Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle </b>If this coin were not minted at the order of President Theodore Roosevelt, we would never witness this beautiful coin, designed by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. The goodwill to introduce American coinage to the world and Roosevelt's affection for Greek and Roman high relief coins motivated Saint-Gaudens to create this masterpiece. Although the coin was not accepted initially for its impractical design, because the high relief made stacking coins difficult, these coins are considered to be one of the most beautiful and valuable coins in the American history. They say that around ten of these coins is preserved in Fort Knox. Only two coins are out in the world, one is stored at Smithsonian Institute and the other one was owned by Egypt’s King Farouk.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1815" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1907-Ultra-High-Relief-Saint-Gaudens-2-300x168.jpg" alt="1907 Ultra High Relief Saint-Gaudens" width="423" height="237" />

8. <b>1943 Bronze Lincoln Cent </b>

In 1943 the Government of USA tried to conserve copper which was necessary for ammunition in World War II. The U.S. Mint began using steel blanks for the Cents in an effort to conserve copper. Over a billion "Steelies" (as they are known popularly) were struck by the three Mints combined in 1943; Philadelphia alone produced over 684,000,000 examples.  However, a handful of rare 1943 Cents has been discovered struck in error on old-style, bronze blanks. These bronze cents became one of the rarest coins in American coinage, highly sought after by passionate collectors.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1797" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1943-Bronze-Lincoln-Cent-300x168.jpg" alt="1943 Bronze Lincoln Cent" width="416" height="233" /><b></b><b>9. 1913 Liberty Head Nickel </b>

<b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is another rare coin in the American coinage history. This Liberty Head Nickel was produced in an extremely limited quantity and unauthorized by the US Mint, making it one of the best-known rarities among collectors. Only five of these coins are known to exist, and there is not a lot of information about their minting process. However, that was the first coin to break the million dollar barrier when at an auction.It was sold to Jay Parrino for $1,485,000 in 1996. </span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1798" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1913-Liberty-Head-1-300x168.jpg" alt="1913 Liberty Head Nickel" width="441" height="247" />

10. <b></b><b>1793 Chain Cent </b>

<b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the first  regular issued coin produced by the US Mint and also the first large cent in America. This coin was only struck  in 1793. Although, this cent did not pick up much commerce wise, this coin is highly regarded by collectors as a valuable coin.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1799" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1793-Liberty-1-300x168.jpg" alt="1793 Chain Cent" width="418" height="234" />11. <b>1885 Trade Dollar </b>

<b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This coin was designed by William Barber and only five proof coins were struck in 1885. This fact made this 1885 Trade Dollar extremely rare and valuable US coin. In January 2006 an authentic Dollar which was previously owned by  the legendary "King of Coins" banker, Louis E. Eliasberg Sr. was sold for $1.3 Million at an auction in Dallas, Texas, USA.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1800" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1885-Trade-Dollar-1-300x168.jpg" alt="1885 Trade Dollar" width="468" height="262" />12. <b></b><b>1873-CC no-arrows Liberty Seated Dime</b>

These Liberty Seated Dimes were minted at the Carson City mints and considered rare coins , because the mint functioned for only a certain amount of time. The Carson City mint also provided more limited series than other US Mint branches. The 1873 Liberty Seated Dime is considered to be one of the rarest coins in the American history. Due to the CC Mint record, 12,400 of these coins were struck when the standard for coin weights were changed. These coins were presumed to be melted and re-coined with the standardized weight and the addition of arrows on either side of the date. However, few of these coins escaped melting for assay purpose and a some pieces were saved for the mint storage. The last time this coin was auctioned in 2004 it was sold for $891,250.

<b></b><b></b>This privately minted coin was produced by the popular gold and silversmith Ephraim Brasher in 1787. Although this coin is not technically part of the US coinage, it is still one of the rare coins produced in the USA. In 1979, a Brasher Doubloon  was sold at an auction for $725,000, which was a record lasted for almost a decade.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1802" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Brasher-Doubloon-1-300x168.jpg" alt="Brasher Doubloon" width="447" height="251" />14. <b>1893-S Morgan Silver Dollar </b>

<b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1893 Morgan Silver Dollars are the rarest coins among all Morgan Silver Dollars. The year 1893 brought several events that ultimately influenced the rarity of this coin. The silver purchase clause of the Act of July 14, 1890, was repealed on November 1, 1893, resulting in a drastically reduced need for silver to be converted into coinage. One of these coins was sold for $414 thousand dollars back in late 2001 at Stacks Auction.</span>

15. <b>1909-S VDB Lincoln Cent </b>

<b></b>When Victor David Brenner designed this popular coin and placed his initials on the reverse, he didn't think that one day these coins will go down in history. When the coins were released,  the public appreciated the coin's design but was not pleased with the prominent initials VDB on the reverse. The mint had no other option but to respond to the public by removing the initials in its next coin release. However,484,000 of these coins were minted at the San Francisco facility while the next releases were minted at Philadelphia facility. The SF mintage was considered to be limited comparing to Philadelphia and  made S Lincoln Cent extremely popular among collectors. Even some coins are in a bad condition, they still sold for a few hundred dollars at Auctions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bitcoin</strong> is the hot topic recently after the Bitcoin price reached a historical high of over USD 2,700 on May 25th, marking an 180% year-on-year increase. Speculations are blooming around the subject. However, the certainty is that for those who made $10 investment in bitcoin in 2010, now they would have $7.5 million. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s review facts first and then talk about the reasons for Bitcoin behavior. </span>
<h3><b>Bitcoin ABC:</b></h3>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin founder - Satoshi Nakamoto.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximum supply of bitcoin is set at 21 million.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It does not pertain to any regulatory institution or country.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first transaction made with Bitcoin: May 22nd, 2010 - a programmer bought two pizzas worth 10,000 bitcoins.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2010 a bitcoin was worth 0.03 cent.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 25th, 2017, it is worth little over 2,700 dollars.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan passed recently a law that accepts Bitcoins as legal currency and payment method.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Why is Bitcoin going up?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Opinions are dispersed, but it is obvious there is no right answer, rather it seems a serious of favorable events caused the bitcoin price up, following the positive, ascending trend noticed for some time now (means, analysts expect bitcoin price continues to grow).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From most of the reviews, Japan is passing the law on accepting bitcoins as currency and payment method has been definitory in raising demand for bitcoins. Currently, more that 40% of bitcoin trade is done in Japan and Korea in Yeni. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some analysts explain that bitcoin price is all about supply and demand. Considering all political uncertainty in the US with Trump, in Europe with Brexit, in Asia with China and bad loans, bitcoin becomes sought out as a “safe haven”, which is not regulated by any country and is considered safe in such times of distress. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is possible that now we see a price bubble, result of economic turbulences and market reaction to events enumerated above, as there are the skeptics who expect bitcoin prices to drop even by 50% in the next period, meaning around USD 1,500, us witnessing the so-called “correction” in prices. On another hand, such event can even be perceived as a great time for investment in bitcoins. Either way, in the long run, the positive trend is expected to be kept. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if more states would follow Japan’ example on accepting bitcoins, this could make the cryptocurrency an even more attractive investment, and it would draw the ones who previously avoided it due to the high risk and price swings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If there were another major financial crisis, we would see bitcoin prices rising even higher, as these are one of the safest investments out there. Bitcoin now is somewhat regarded as “digital gold” by some investors. There are many similarities, they're both issued through a mining process (one real, the other simulated), they are both finite, and they are both seen as a store of value. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why if you’re like Bitcoin, chances are you may also want to diversify your portfolio with gold. However, turning Bitcoin into gold can be difficult, time-consuming and expensive. That’s why Bullion Exchanges offers a great variety of precious metals bullion and accept Bitcoin as a paying option. </span>

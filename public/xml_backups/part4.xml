<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar slipped against the bucket of major currencies on Thursday. After two speeches from Fed officials, the US Dollar to Euro exchange rate has remained close. The first-time filings for U.S. unemployment benefits rose slightly last week, supporting the view that the labor market would tighten further. Gold prices rose on Thursday, supported by the weaker dollar and weakness in US Treasury yields. Among other precious metals, silver gained about 1 per cent. Platinum touched its highest in a week during the session, palladium also slightly rose today.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2435.46 (+0.03%) and NASDAQ Index 6239.06 (+0.09%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21411.28(+0.01%).</span>

U.S. stock market indexes opened slightly changed on Thursday, as oil prices remained near multi-month lows, undermining efforts by major producers to stabilize the market.  Oil prices rose on Thursday, but investors worry over whether OPEC-led output cuts would be able to rein in a three-year glut continued to keep prices around 10-month lows.

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,259.20 (+0.49%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.81 (+0.83%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $930.30 (-0.06%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $885.35 (-1.01%), Dow Jones index 21,368.56 (0.13% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
U.S. Dollar Index futures are trading lower on Friday. While the news would usually be good for US oil exporters, the price of crude has instead dropped even lower than earlier this week.The dollar is under pressure from falling U.S. Treasury yields and worries that weak inflation will keep the Fed from raising rates later in the year. Gold prices edged higher on Friday as the dollar softened and risk aversion due to geopolitical events buoyed the safe-haven appeal of the metal. The Fed has mentioned it will most likely raise rates one more time.  Among other precious metals: silver gained about one percent, platinum and palladium lost a few points.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US. stocks on Friday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2433.80 (-0.02%) and NASDAQ Index 6228.80 (-0.14%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21368.56(-0.13%).</span>

This week economic data was pretty light. Investors will keep an eye on key US economic data due next week. US data due next week include the June consumer confidence indicator, pending home sales, crude oil inventories, revised first-quarter GDP and the PCE price index. Oil is not in short supply with U.S. producers drilling and pumping as soon as oil prices rise over $50.

<b><i>After last week that produced zero “high” rated events, this coming week will see a lot of economic data for investors. </i></b><b><i>Fed speakers comments will also be an important focus this week</i></b><b><i>. </i></b><b><i>Overall, improved data can remedy the source of weakness for the US Dollar now: markets don’t believe the Fed’s prescribed path for raising rates and normalizing policy. </i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After being weaker last week, the US Dollar Index started Monday on a stable note. The US Dollar Index lost strength last week because of a weak support from US economic data and increased concerns about the another one interest rate hike by the Fed. This week the market focused core durable goods orders, CB Consumer Confidence, pending home sales, and US GDP scheduled to release. Gold price fell today about 1 per cent the lowest point since May. No-one has a clue what happened; some investors suggest this drop was a result of an erroneous order. Among the other precious metals: silver price slightly decreased, platinum and palladium prices are also lower on Monday.   </span>
<h2><b>Stock Market Today</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2441.50 (+0.13%) and NASDAQ Index 6259.15 (-0.11%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21394.76 (-0.01%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an important scheduled economic data this week. Meanwhile, geopolitical concerns will continue to be a factor in US market.The market analytics consider the market could be weighted down because of the trouble in a  lot of places like North Korea, Syria, even the European Union or the United Kingdom. This week investors will be also focused on financials after the Italian government agreed to spend billion to wind up two of the Italy's banks. In politics, the U.S. President Donald Trump will meet the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi at the White House on Monday, for discussing the ideas about fighting terrorism and promoting economic growth.</span>

<b>Economic data for this week: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durable Goods orders,Chicago Fed national activity Index (</span><b>Monday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), June Consumer Confidence, Fed Chair Janet Yellen in London on global economic issues (</span><b>Tuesday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), May Advance Trade in Goods (</span><b>Wednesday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Final GDP revision (</span><b>Thursday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, May Personal Consumption Expenditure Core, Personal income (</span><b>Friday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span>]]></content>

		<title>Gold vs. Commodities</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have seen weakness in the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> over the past two weeks, and if gold fails to break higher from its ongoing consolidation over the next 3-6 months, a significant culprit will selling amongst broad-based commodity funds. Below we zoom in on a detail of the CRB Commodity Index, which gold measures an average price level of 19 commodities including <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/coins">silver</a>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum/coins">platinum</a>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium/coins">palladium</a>, the industrial metals, the energy complex, and agricultural products.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that the CRB index has recently broken below its 15-month support zone between 176 – 179, which had held since April 2016.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2174 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CRB-1024x767.png" alt="CRB Commodity" width="840" height="629" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our technical target for the CRB over the short run is 158 on the index – in other words, a retest of the 2016 lows. This target is calculated by subtracting the amplitude of the failed advance above the support zone (19) from the breakdown point (177). Fundamentally, it represents an equal number of long contract holders who are likely to liquidate below the breakdown point as who bought above the support zone over the past year.</span>
<h3><b>Gold Sometimes Grouped with Other Commodities</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although gold is certainly not simply another commodity like the rest of the CRB index, during times in which investor psychology is preoccupied with “hot” markets such as technology stocks (Amazon, Facebook, etc.), real estate, and crypto-currencies, sentiment tends to fade against all commodities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We might disagree with the market fundamentally, i.e. we know currency debasement and unsustainable debt continues to increase every day, but a key point of our philosophy is to put our own fundamental opinion second, and to respect the market first.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At present, the market is seeing less of a need for safety due to a focus on hot risky asset classes, and so that component of gold demand is absent. We are thus witnessing gold and silver have a high correlation with the rest of the commodity complex. In such an environment, when institutional funds place sells orders for their diversified commodity holdings, gold is dumped in tandem with the group.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, gold has been outpacing the rest of the commodity complex since the late 2015 lows. However, such relative strength is not always sufficient to stop precious metals from falling in a general commodity liquidation over the short run. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If we see gold break down below $1,230, a key short-term support level, a continued decline in the CRB index will be a major contributing factor.</span>
<h3><b>Commodity Index Long-Term</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we back out the chart for the CRB index from 1974 – 2017:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2175 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CRB-Commodity.png" alt="CRB Commodity" width="1019" height="763" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be noted that </span><b>broad <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/02/06/gold-silver-commodities/">commodities</a> are now the cheapest they have been in 43 years nominally</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and by far the cheapest in real terms (adjusted for inflation). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The low of 2016 is in the process of being retested, which is what may lead to near-term weakness in gold – but in viewing the chart above we must seriously ask the question: how much lower can commodities fall from 43-year lows?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are tangible materials of finite supply in the earth’s crust, which the ever-growing world population consumes every day – a reality that will not change in our lifetimes unless technology to harvest minerals from asteroids arrives soon, a scenario still the realm of science fiction works.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The CRB Commodity Index cannot go to zero as a currency or individual stock can, yet this is the lowest that commodities have been in four decades. <b>When things that cannot go to zero are priced at their lowest in over a generation, we must view the relative risk/reward proposition as favorable from a long-term perspective.</b> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our assessment is that even if moderate weakness continues for several months to 1-2 years, broad commodities are much closer to a long-term bottom than a top. <img class="alignright wp-image-2176 size-medium" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Cycle-300x155.png" alt="The relative risk" width="300" height="155" /></span>

<b>Commodity Cycles</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Commodities are cyclical in nature. The chart at right shows the three major cycles that the commodity complex has seen since the 1970’s, divided into two sub-phases each of boom and bust cycles (green and red shading, respectively). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Booms and busts are an inherent feature of the typical 10-20 year delay that it takes for the mining lifecycle to move from:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a) mineral discovery through </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(b) mine permitting to </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(c) construction to </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(d) successful production which then</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(e) increases supply in the market. </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is said that in commodities “low prices are the solution for low prices”, as marginal mine supply is eliminated when prices fall, eventually forcing prices higher again. We are seeing this phenomenon already in many junior oil and precious metals companies: deposits which were once economic are no longer at today’s low commodity prices, and thus the mines are placed on care and maintenance, reducing supply until higher prices emerge.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Commodities in Relation to Gold</b></h3>
Even if weakness continues in the commodity complex through the remainder of this year, our assessment is that most commodities are much closer to long-term bottoms than long-term tops. Of course, each commodity will move at different times and with a different set of fundamentals. Yet the macro analysis shows a world preoccupied at the moment with the bull markets in digital technology – but as day must follow night, higher commodity prices must follow a period of lower prices. Gold selling due to broad commodity weakness is thus limited in the big picture, even if weakness over the short run cannot be ruled out.

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,250.60 (+0.57%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.72 (+0.41%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $925.60 (+0.21%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $871.00 (-0.89%), Dow Jones index 21,411.56 (0.01% increase). </i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar is falling against the bucket of main currencies on Tuesday. The US dollar index has lost 6.3% in recent months. The continued decline in long-term perspective has come despite a 1% bounce in the US dollar index in the past weeks. Gold rose on Tuesday after hitting a six-week low in the previous session. A huge sell order of total 1.85 million ounces pushed gold to a six-week low on Monday, although the markets stayed pretty silent about this drop. Analytics consider there is a risk that the Fed delivers more interest rates rises than expected, and it will create a positive boost for the Dollar, which may weigh down gold. Among other precious metals: silver rose 0.6 %, platinum price climbed today, palladium price lost a few points. </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened slightly lower S&amp;P 500 2437.15 (-0.08%) and NASDAQ Index 6226.38 (-0.33%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21411.56(+0.01%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street started Tuesday mixed as yesterday economic data battled pressure and housing markets received a weak reading on home price growth. Some of the international most influential bankers will speak on Tuesday. Also, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to appear at a conference in London at 1 p.m. ET. The Bank of England will announce its Financial Stability Report, providing insight into its views on the current economic situation in the U.K., which is also important for US markets. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Weaker-than-expected durable-goods orders released yesterday may also limit gains for the markets. Durable-goods orders slipped 1.1% in May following a similar drop in April, disappointing investors who expected a smaller decline.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar is weaker in morning trades on Wednesday. The US Dollar slipped down this week after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen made her first public remarks yesterday since the US central bank raised rates on June 14. While there was no clear indication from the Yellen’s comments that plans for tightening monetary policy had accelerated or decelerated, she did feel it necessary to mention that US asset valuations are somewhat ‘rich’ by traditional metrics. Gold prices climbed today, rising for the second straight session at the bullion market today. As always weakness trend in the dollar raised demand for the precious metals as a safe-haven. Among other precious metals: silver also increased today, platinum price climbed today, palladium price lost a few points.  </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2431.84 (+0.51%) and NASDAQ Index 6168.48 (+0.38%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21426.81(+0.55%). </span>

U.S. stock futures traded higher on Wednesday after the European Central Bank tried to walk back comments made by its president. In economic news, consumer confidence data for June topped investors' expectations. Investors keep an eye on a report on U.S. international trade in goods for May, which will be released today.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar dropped to its lows for the year today as the comments from major central banks signaled the era of easy money might be coming to an end. Support for the dollar disappeared as investors realized the US Federal Reserve might not be the only game in town when it came to higher interest rates. Gold lost some points today even </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">US dollar weakened against other currencies on bets that central banks in Europe were preparing to scale back monetary stimulus, but the bullion's gains were capped by a surge in equities. Among other precious metals: silver slightly lower today, platinum and palladium decreased today.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened mixed S&amp;P 500 2438.66 (-0.09%) and NASDAQ Index 6202.56 (-0.54%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21459.61(+0.02%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street was mixed on Thursday after the European Central Bank tried to walk back remarks made by ECB President Mario Draghi a day earlier.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices rose to a two-week high, extending the rally into the sixth straight session after a decline in weekly US production eased concerns about deepening oversupply. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The markets were also little changed after data showed the US economy slowed less sharply in the first quarter than initially estimated due to unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger jump in exports. </span>

US Dollar is slightly higher against the bucket of the major currencies on Friday. Yesterday the US Dollar Index was holding below 95.40, headed toward the lowest close since late September. Gold price Gold and silver prices slipped this week in the international as well as US markets. Gold prices are higher today. Rising interest rate scenarios, weak investment demand, and optimism about the US economic growth and hints from leading central bank have been causing troubles for gold prices. Although dollar index is standing at nine-month lows, it is not offering any support for precious metals. Among the other precious metals: silver slightly dropped, palladium also lost a few points, platinum price increased.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2428.82 (+0.38%) and NASDAQ Index 6162.95 (+0.28%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21389.47(+0.48%). </span>

Wall Street Indexes were higher in early trading on Friday, considering that US markets could close out the week with not mixed results. Friday marks the final trading session of the 1st part of 2017, a period marked by strong stock market returns and low volatility. Taking a look at the second part of 2017, investors believe it unlikely that low volatility will persist indefinitely. Investors also keep an eye on more data releases, such as personal income rising more than the expected gains. Consumer sentiment is slated to come out today. No significant earnings or bond auctions are scheduled.

		<title>Gold – A Large Move is Approaching</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">On a semi-regular basis, we find it helpful to revisit the longer-term perspective for the precious metals, so that short-term price action does not dominate our focus. This will be important shortly as, despite what may seem like a volatile market over the past few months, </span><b>we have reason to believe that the volatility in the gold market is set to increase massively throughout the second half of 2017 and into 2018</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> is in the process of forming a long-term bottom, but the challenge is that long-term bottoms often feature prices which can see a series of retests and/or nominal new lows throughout a multi-year basing period. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 20-year <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold chart</a> below, we see a confluence of four major technical support levels between the $850/ounce and $1,045/ounce levels. Whenever there is a confluence of technical targets within a certain price band, it represents a high-confidence level for a major low to form. While the following zone is too wide for short-term traders, it should give a reliable long-term support target for investors with a multi-year time horizon.</span>

<strong> The levels are labeled below:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2008 – 2015 horizontal support at $1,045.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term rising linear trendline which started in 2001, now at $900.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the entire 2000 – 2011 advance, which comes at $890.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former 1980 all-time closing high, which comes at $850.</span></li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2200 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Gold-2008-2015-P1.png" alt="Gold 2008-2015 P1" width="1125" height="495" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains possible that the absolute low for gold was formed in December 2015 at $1,045, but the likelihood of a retest of that level and/or nominal new lows is still significant. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A break of gold’s long-term declining 2011 – 2017 downtrend would give us increased confidence that the absolute low has already been formed, but this key <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/04/17/gold-breakout-approaching/">technical breakout</a> has remained elusive despite multiple attempts over the previous year.</span>
<h3><b>Gold Short-Term</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Zooming into the 18-month view, gold is extremely “tight” on the short-term chart, caught between its falling long-term downtrend (magenta) and its short-term rising trend from January (dashed teal color). These two trends are converging within the next six weeks, and when this happens one must necessarily break. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The immediate area of concern is highlighted below in green:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2201 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Gold-2011-2017-Downtrend-P2-1024x767.png" alt="Gold 2011-2017 Downtrend P2" width="840" height="629" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A break lower from this short-term green triangle opens up an initial decline to the $1,160 level in Q3, corresponding with the rising blue trend forming the lower boundary of the pennant-shaped consolidation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a break higher would be an important signal of a market set to start a new multi-year advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We truly are approaching a crossroads for the precious metal on the short-term chart.</span>

<b>Volatility Confirms Significant Move Ahead</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That a large price move is coming for gold can also be seen by examining volatility. Below is an index which trades on the Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE), which tracks the daily volatility of gold futures contracts. The index is shown since 2010:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2202 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GVZ-Gold-Volatility-P3.png" alt="GVZ Gold Volatility P3" width="878" height="437" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we can see, gold volatility is now at 8-year lows. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility is inherently a neutral market expression – in other words when volatility is low, it only tells us that a period of higher volatility is set to follow. However, it does not tell us in which direction the strong movement will occur.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The CBOE volatility index is confirming that either a surge or a significant decline is to come in gold, depending on which direction the consolidation breaks.</span>
<h3><b>How Would This Look on the Long-Term Chart?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term chart on page 1 is now stripped of its annotations so that we can envision how either a breakout higher or lower – as predicted by both our technical analysis and the record low volatility of present –  would manifest in the market:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2203 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Confluence-of-Support-Levels-Bottom-Zone-1024x451.png" alt="Confluence of Support Levels -Bottom Zone" width="840" height="370" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical analysis is about identifying high probability scenarios based on observable trends in the marketplace. It is no crystal ball, but it does help establish reasonable expectations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again: the breakout either higher or lower must begin by Q3 – Q4. This is based on the convergence of the pennant consolidation visible in the 18-month gold chart.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout higher should see an initial advance to target 2016 highs near $1,375 per ounce, followed by a modest retracement, en route to the $1,535 in 2018.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a break lower should see a rapid plunge to retest 2015 lows at $1,045, followed by a modest recovery, which would then open up the possibility of new lows within the green support band below $1,000.</span>
<h3><b>Worst Case Scenario</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We maintain that even the worst-case scenario of a drop below $1,000 will represent part of a larger multi-year bottoming process – and so: </span><b>how one should consider preparing is largely dependent on one’s individual time the horizon and risk tolerance.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those with shorter-term time horizons should be cautioned that if new lows formed, it could take gold several more years of basing to regain its upward trajectory. Yet accumulation throughout any final plunge would be a healthy plan for those looking to accumulate holdings as part of a long-term strategy.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,225.20 (+0.03%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.07 (+0.18%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $914.00 (+0.33%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $842.75 (-0.15%), Dow Jones index 21,403.07 (0.35% decrease)</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After pulling back last week, the US Dollar Index is on a stable note this week. US dollar slightly fell on Thursday after a round of weaker than expected market data, giving space for raising interest rates by the Federal Reserve. The greenback was already on the slipping way after Wednesday's issue of the Fed's policy minutes failed to provide a clear picture of future interest rate increases. Gold price is pretty steady on Thursday, as Federal Reserve at least released a few comments how about future interest rates and how inflation might affect the rate hikes. Investors concern that higher interest rates tend to boost the dollar and weigh down the gold price. Among other precious metals: silver is slightly increased, platinum price is up, and palladium price is still lower this week. In general, it seems that all the main metals are having troubles moving higher, and geopolitical tensions with North Korea just add issues to this situation.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2422.28 (-0.42%) and NASDAQ Index 6123.25 (-0.45%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21403.07(-0.35%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading lower today because of the combination of geopolitical tension and some signs that global central banks are running closer to the idea that rising bond yields are hurting investor sentiment. Investors are also becoming risk-averse due to rising concerns about the North Korea’s test launch this week. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, President Donald Trump took time during his speech in Poland, on Thursday to comment on the economic situation in the US and the recent situation for the stock market.</span>

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekly Bill Settlement, Chain Store Sales, Jobless Claims, Fed balance sheet, Money Supply. </span>]]></content>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar Index is on a positive note this week and stable in the early hours today after Thursday showed a rise in non-manufacturing sector activity in June. That was an especially supportive result for the US Index. Gold price fell on Friday, and it was its biggest weekly loss in two months. Gold has been weighed down by overall bearish sentiment toward the sector. A stronger-than-expected NFP report could increase the odds of another Fed rate hike later in the year so this news is likely to be bearish for gold prices. Among the other precious metals: silver lost over 2 percent, Platinum price is down, palladium dropped in Friday trading and this is its lowest level since June 2.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2416.59 (+0.28%) and NASDAQ Index 6126.25 (+0.60%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21364.85 (+0.21%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today after the Labor Department released the June hiring and unemployment figures on Friday morning showed the U.S. added 222,000 jobs in June and this is the second largest gain this year. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the latest official data of the state of the American economy, covered the unemployment rate and non-farm payrolls results. The government employment report also added more support for the Federal Reserve to continue its plan to normalize monetary policy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors wait for a two-day meeting of G20 leaders that starts on Friday in Hamburg. Along with President Trump, others attending include Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan.</span>

&nbsp;

<b><i>Here is a new week ahead, which will bring a lot of economic data on inflation, sales and production, the aftermath of the G20 meeting and geopolitical developments, also Fed chair Yellen’s Humphrey Hawkins testimony. The important data release on the calendar this week could help clarify the near-term perspectives for the Fed and the markets.     </i></b><b><i>
</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
US Dollar Index is trading slightly higher on Monday, being supported by bigger than expected increase in U.S. jobs release. The report suggests the US economy is strong enough for the Fed to continue with its increasing rates plan. Even, the Fed has signaled last week willingness to raise interest rates even with the economy holding back. The  US Dollar was also supported by higher U.S. Treasury yields. Gold price was steady early Monday and then slightly decreased. Last week gold fell more than 2 percent and reached the lowest level since March.  Among other precious metals: Silver was trading lower on Monday, platinum and palladium prices also lost points.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2428.81 (+0.15%) and NASDAQ Index 6167.38 (+0.23%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21428.67 (0.09%).</span>

Wall Street started a new week on a positive note with the higher indexes. The first aftermath after G20 meeting gave increasing hope about the strength of the world economy. By many means, the June jobs report was a pretty good one. The US economy added 220,000 new jobs. Both the employment rate and the labor force participation rate higher.

President Trump's participation in G20 and visit to Poland haven’t caused any significant changes in the global market. The major issue on the summit was that the US left the climate change agreement and Trump’s meeting with Russian President-Vladimir Putin.

<strong>The economic data this week:</strong> Consumer credit <strong>(Monday)</strong>, Job openings, Wholesale inventories <strong>(Tuesday)</strong>, Janet Yellen testimony <strong>(Wednesday)</strong>, Weekly jobless claims, along with the June Federal budget <strong>(Thursday)</strong>, Consumer Price Index, Retail Sales, Industrial Production <strong>(Friday)</strong>.

		<title>Silver’s Flash Crash</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> saw a “flash crash” on Thursday night EST / Friday morning in Asia, falling momentarily by at least $1.50 before recovering somewhat during the day.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The actual low print is up to some debate, depending on which exchange and contract one refer to the low bid for the spot market (shown below) according to our trading desk was $14.16, while some other platforms are showing the low as $14.50.<img class="alignright wp-image-2229 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Flash-crash.png" alt="Silver &quot;Flash, crash&quot;" width="579" height="448" /> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will be conservative and call the low $14.16. Either way, clearly the exchanges were overwhelmed with whoever decided to sell such a quantity of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> in such a short period.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many futures traders were stopped out at significant losses during the "flash crash". However, as discussed in recent articles, we have been monitoring negative leading signals in both the CRB commodity index and the gold/silver ratio for the past month, and so we were largely expecting the recent drops in metals prices.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Several analysts are calling this "flash crash" the final bottom for silver’s recent decline: they are likely premature in these calls. It is important to understand what happens during a "flash crash": someone dumps a huge amount of paper silver on the market at a single instant. Stops are taken out, and selling begets further selling as traders panic to avoid losses. The selling only stops when a significantly large entity – who is using lower leverage and thus does not run the risk of being stopped out by the waterfall decline – steps in with a sufficiently-large bid to absorb all the panic selling.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is: we now know where large entities are willing to buy silver. That figure is down near $14.16 or slightly above.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bad news is: that level is likely to be retested at least once, if not on multiple occasions over the next 3-6 months. In a worst-case scenario, the large bidder will be exhausted (though he will have absorbed most of the sellers), and a final low will occur marginally below the bidder’s established price ($14.16 at the lower range).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, we have here, in this flash crash, a strong piece of evidence to suggest that the low for silver’s current decline will occur in the low-to-mid $14 range. We will, of course, use other forms of technical analysis to zero in on this low as it approaches.</span>
<h3><b>On Manipulation</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a final note on silver: yes, we would consider this type of selling to be “manipulation” of the markets, by some entity. However, our goal is to be pragmatic: such manipulation is going to occur periodically in silver, so let us at least protect ourselves and possibly profit from these occasions, as opposed to standing by as mere victims as many commentators seem content to do in the precious metals world. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the long run, silver will eventually be moving higher.</span>
<h3><b>Silver Intermediate Outlook</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning to the silver chart itself, for the week gold’s cousin fell $1.20 or 7.2%, to close at $15.43 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.  The technical damage is reflected on the near-term chart and outlook:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2230 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Primary-resistance.png" alt="Silver technical damage" width="586" height="529" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our view is that, in percentage terms, the majority of silver’s decline is already behind us. A final drop to the low $14’s or mid $13’s would not constitute a significant further percentage drop – but it would sufficiently harm investor sentiment such that a functional retest of 2015 lows could mark the most important buying opportunity for the remainder of the decade.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The advance that occurs following a double-bottom scenario of the $13 - $14 region (equivalent to the 2015 lows) should be just as strong as the surge that began in first-half 2016… so let us remain prepared.</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - July, 11</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,213.10 (-0.18%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $15.72 (-0.25%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $899.30 (-0.91%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $846.70 (+0.02%), Dow Jones index 21,409.50 (0.98% increase)</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
US Dollar Index is trading higher, supported by the economic reports and a weaker Euro and Japanese Yen. The investor's actions are slow this week ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s remarks before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. Analytics and traders hope Yellen’s testimony gives the clues about the timing of the next Fed interest rate hike. The major predictions suggest next rate hike could be in December. Gold price started Tuesday lower on the stronger US Dollar. Bullion prices are also looking ahead to Yellen's testimony. Precious metals are incredibly sensitive to rising rates because they push up bond yields, increasing the opportunity cost of holding non-interest-bearing gold. Among other precious metals: silver price slowly decreased today,  platinum price lost about 1 percent, palladium price is slightly increased.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2424.76 (-0.11%) and NASDAQ Index 6179.70 (+0.07%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21409.50 (+0.98%). </span>

Wall Street Indexes are trading mixed today with little changes less than 1 percent. The overall market trend is lower this week because investors keep their attention on upcoming economic data later this week. After the strong jobs report on Friday last week another release of U.S. Job openings will be released today at 10 a.m.

On the geopolitical field after G20 meeting aftermath last week market analysts and economists believe that the geopolitical risk will continue to weigh down global markets. Rising tensions between countries ever since President Trump came to power keep traders and investors on their next course of actions.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index seems to be ready to rebound on Wednesday after the regular session opening. The market is reversing earlier weakness ahead of the first day of Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s first day of testimony before the Congress. Based on the current price and the earlier price actions the direction of the index is likely to turn from weaker position to the higher level in the short-term perspective. Gold price held steady on Wednesday as investors are awaiting testimony from US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and central bank officials expressed caution about further interests rate hikes. Any pause in US interest rate would be highly beneficial for gold price and help it to recover. Among other precious metals: silver rose about 0.75 %, platinum and palladium prices gained over 1% in an early trading session.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2439.00 (+0.55%) and NASDAQ Index 6243.03 (+0.84%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21500.97 (+0.43%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street main indexes advanced on Wednesday, after the release of prepared congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen who said earlier that the interest rate increases will be gradual and would not need to rise much further.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest political news about the emails between Donald Trump Jr that were framed as part of the Russian government's support for Donald Trump added some tension in stock markets, offering warnings that investors should be aware of all upcoming changes.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
US Dollar looks steady on early morning trading, following Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s speech. Janet Yellen started her two-day testimony to Congress yesterday with a more dovish take on a monetary policy that sent the greenback on the lower level. Yellen said on Wednesday that the U.S. economy was healthy enough for further rate hikes. Gold price slightly dropped on Thursday, while a weaker dollar could be supportive for gold over the short term, the continued strength in US equities remain a drag. Meanwhile, gold prices have seen only a mild recovery following Yellen's testimony on Wednesday; there has not been any convincing reversal as such, only a slight pullback. Among other precious metals: silver price is lower, platinum and palladium prices lost over 1 percent.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2447.52 (+0.17%) and NASDAQ Index 6269.11 (+0.13%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21563.06 (+0.14%).</span>

Wall Street Indexes edged up higher in Thursday trading, Weekly jobless claims and the Producer Price Index for June will be released today. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is set to testify before the Senate Banking Committee in Washington at 9:30 a.m

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals  </b></h3>
U.S. Dollar Index is trading lower today shortly before the release of reports on U.S. Consumer Inflation and June Retail Sales. Generally speaking, US Dollar was on the better level this week after Fed Chair Janet Yellen showed deeper concerns over the persistently weak inflation during her testimony before the Senate Banking Committee earlier this week. Gold price jumped higher exactly after the results of Yellen’s speech because investors don’t want the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates anytime soon. Among other precious metals: silver price rose this morning, platinum and palladium prices are also up.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened mixed S&amp;P 500 2447.45 (-0.02%) and NASDAQ Index 6286.79 (+0.21%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21536.48 (-0.08%).</span>

Wall Street Indexes were mixed today ahead of the first set of earnings from the big Wall Street banks.

The Consumer Price Index and retail sales report for June will be released today. Data on industrial production for June also will be released.

Geopolitical tension keeps weighing down the global markets. After North Korea successfully launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4, US Administration may enforce new sanctions on small Chinese banks and firms for their connections to North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,236.50 (+0.28%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.23 (+0.49%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $935.40 (+0.55%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $864.35 (+0.49%), Dow Jones index 21,629.88 (0.04% decrease)</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a new week ahead which will bring us the major economic events: meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, profit reports from JPMorgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo. In the U.S. economic news investors are also waiting for more highlights coming out of Washington on the Russian investigation. Across the globe, investors and analytics will be watching the news from the European Central Bank will have to say about interest rates.    </span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals  </b></h3>
US Dollar Index was steady in early morning trading, based on the current price the direction of US Dollar Index is likely to be in a positive direction.The dollar index has also been influenced by the movement in the Euro. Gold price is also trading higher today in the early session on Monday. However, the futures market showed no dynamic following the disappointing U.S. economic data on Friday. Gold traders should focus on the direction of U.S. Treasury yields and not so much on the direction of U.S.Dollar.  Among other precious metals: silver price slightly rose, platinum and palladium prices are also higher today.
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened mixed S&amp;P 500 2458.60 (-0.03%) and NASDAQ Index 6315.45 (+0.05%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21629.88 (-0.04%).</span>

Wall Street indexes were little changed on Monday; investors are looking ahead to key quarterly results which will be released later this week. Corporate quarterly results could help to shed light on whether current levels are justified by economic activity at American corporations. While investors are concentrated on earning reports, economic analytics suggest tax legislation remains the most important issue for  US  stocks.

The criticism about a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Kremlin-linked lawyer in June 2016 also adds tension in US stocks market.

<strong>Economic data for today:</strong> Empire State Index (Monday), Import prices, Home builders’ index (Tuesday), Housing starts (Wednesday), Weekly jobless claims, Leading economic indicators (Thursday), Friday-nothing scheduled.]]></content>

		<title>Gold Technical Update</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week we noted that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver </a>had broken its year-long support zone between $15.75 - $16.15 during the prior week’s <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/10/silvers-flash-crash/">flash crash</a>. What does this apparent breakdown mean for gold? Let us update the technical perspective for gold for the short and intermediate timeframes:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2258" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Gold-for-the-short-and-intermediate-timeframes.png" alt="Gold for the short and intermediate time frames" width="1058" height="792" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the week as a sum, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> rose 1.5% or $18 to close at $1,227 as of the final trade in New York on Friday afternoon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks ago, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> broke short-term rising support at $1,232 (turquoise line, above). This trendline was rising, and we must recall that retests of rising trendlines can indeed occur at a different (in this case higher) price level than the original breakdown point.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, our best assessment is that gold is set to move moderately higher for the remainder of July and into August below its broken short-term support. This means that gold should continue moderately higher for the next 4-6 weeks below $1,250. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect gold will not regain its broken (turquoise color) trendline yet, and so the precious metal should then begin to turn lower again by late August, toward a test of its lower (blue) boundary of the pennant consolidation. This level now comes in at $1,175 and is rising by the day.</span>
<h3><b>On a Gold Recapture of Broken Trendline</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If gold were to negate its recent breakdown and recapture $1,250, the convergence of this short-term (turquoise) trend and the long-term (magenta color) 2011-2017 downtrend would occur at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly the same price level</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by late-August: $1,250. So, it would be one of the clearest technical signals we could ask for to indicate a new strong rising trend had begun, as both a breakout from a short-term and long-term resistance level simultaneously. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Officially, there are 5.5 months left before the giant pennant-shaped consolidation shown above must resolve in one direction or another. This would be quite literally at the end of the calendar year in December, visible at the far right of the chart above. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the vast majority of historic examples, these patterns will resolve several months before the actual apex occurs. The August – October timeframe is our best estimation, as for confirmation to whether we will have a legitimate bull market on our hands or the beginning of a decline to new lows perhaps below the 2015 bottoms. There will be opportunities to profit and/or protect ourselves in either scenario, but we must get the primary direction correct first. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, short-term traders are cautioned that </span><b>whiplash is likely</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as gold is officially “trendless” – having broken both its short-term downtrend since June and its intermediate rising trend from January lows – all within the confines of the much larger consolidation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect volatility to begin lessening and for gold to appear almost comatose during the last several weeks immediately prior to either a breakdown or breakout in the August – October timeframe.</span>
<h3><b>Investment Considerations</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">How one chooses to position prior to the resolution of gold’s giant consolidation pattern is largely a factor of personal goals, time horizons, and risk tolerance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, an investor on a long-term accumulation plan, who is investing 10% - 20% of his/her assets into gold as either long-term savings or a “wealth insurance” policy, would likely welcome a period of lower prices should they manifest. After all, buying an asset for lower prices over the short-run can lead to a lower dollar-cost average price for the long-term holding.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, those with a shorter-term time horizon might choose to pay closer attention to the resolution of the chart pattern shown above. If the pattern resolves higher, gold is calculated to see a surge of $200 - $300 within the following 12 months. However, if the pattern resolves lower, an equally large decline is what the target calls for. These might sound like two extreme scenarios – yet these are exactly the types of moves that are predicted from the resolution of converging consolidation patterns.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are now in the terminal last months of gold’s consolidation. Readers should not assume that gold will remain so quiet going forward as it has over the past year. Please stay tuned as we zero in on leading indicators over the next few months which should help us gain insight into gold’s coming resolution in one direction or the other.  </span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,242.50 (+0.39%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.30 (+0.67%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $936.30 (+0.41%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $871.95 (-0.37%), Dow Jones index 21,629.72 (0.04% decrease)</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals  </b></h3>
One of the biggest news today, that the U.S. Dollar dropped to its lowest level since August 2016 against the major currencies on Tuesday, after Republicans discarded the previous plan to repeal Obamacare. Collapse appeared on late Monday meeting when Republicans leaders did not even have enough votes even to begin to debate on the regulation. US markets and investors are losing confidence that President Trump will be able to deliver his promised plans about tax reforms. Gold price rose to a two-week high on Tuesday supported by the weaker dollar and at this moment gold is likely to be on the increasing track. Among other precious metals: silver is trading higher today, platinum rose and touched one-month high, palladium price slightly dropped.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened mixed S&amp;P 500 2459.14 (-0.01%) and NASDAQ Index 6314.43 (+0.03%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21629.72 (-0.04%).</span>

Wall Street major indexes were mixed in early trading, weighed down by the latest earnings reports from some big companies and concerns ability to follow on its economic agenda, following a setback to the health care bill. At the same time, economic data shows that confidence in U.S. economy's future after Trump's election.

Oil prices rose on Tuesday as demand soaked up some of the surplus supplies from OPEC and the United States, but investors consider there are a few signs of big short-term moves.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals  </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index is trading slightly higher on Wednesday morning. There has been no change in the main fundamentals so what investors witness today is probably short-term change ahead of central bank meetings in Japan and Eurozone. Weighing on the dollar was expected yesterday after the collapse of Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare in the Senate. Gold price slightly increased today despite stronger US Dollar Index, market analytics consider the gold price will continue to rise higher or at least remain bullish level and stay above this steady level. Among other precious metals: silver price slightly rose, platinum lost a few points, palladium price is also up.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,243.00 (-0.06%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.37 (-0.06%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $926.75 (-0.12%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $845.00 (-0.18%), Dow Jones index 21,622.43 (0.08% decrease). </i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals  </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar Index is trading lower today against a basket of major currencies, weighed down by weaker than expected economic data over the past several months. Some market experts believe that a weaker dollar can help to boost earnings of Wall Street Indexes. Gold price slightly dropped as the dollar edged higher. Market analytics are waiting for a meeting of the European Central Bank later on Thursday. Among other metals: the major precious metals prices dropped today. </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened slightly higher S&amp;P 500 2475.36 (+0.06%) and NASDAQ Index 6386.31 (+0.03%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21622.43 (-0.08%).</span>

Wall Street Indexes are mostly weighted by political uncertainty recently; market analytics say it’s uncommon that the President’s Administration affects the market so often.  The current Wall Street roller coaster cannot last forever.

The European Central Bank will take center stage on Thursday. Investors are highly focused because the bank might keep interest rates steady. Investors will be on alert for any change in language when president Mario Draghi speaks.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals  </b></h3>
US Dollar Index was trading lower on Friday morning, weighed down by the European Central Bank's discussion in the fall a plan to pare back its bond purchases. The dollar is also staying under pressure because of concerns the Russian investigation could slow down tax reform and other pro-growth policies of the Trump administration. Gold price market has been supported by the weaker dollar. Gold price is steady on Friday and stays on positive track after reaching a three-week high this week.

Among other precious metals: silver price slightly rose today, platinum and palladium prices are also trading higher.

Wall Street Indexes opened lower today with no economic data to focus on, much of the market’s direction was driven by the companies earnings out early Friday.

Most investors have kept their eyes on companies earnings reports this week and geopolitical tension.

After the previous light economic week, here is a new week ahead, when global financial markets will focus on the results of Wednesday’s Federal Reserve policy meeting for any new clues about the next U.S. rate hike. There are also several key U.S. economic reports, with the U.S. advanced second-quarter GDP on Friday. Investors’ focus will also be on headlines coming out of Washington, where the Senate is expected to continue working to repeal Obamacare.The investigation about U.S. President Donald Trump campaign’s ties to Russia will also continue to get investors and analytics attention.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
US Dollar Index gained points on Monday, but still being affected by the political issues. The dollar’s index is weaker against a basket of major currencies and pressured by the US political front of the Trump’s administration’s plan on tax reform and infrastructure spending. Gold price is on the highest level in four weeks today, supported by political uncertainty and unsteady US Dollar. Investors are getting more careful about what is going to happen this week and consider gold as a safe haven.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading lower on Monday ahead of busy economic data week, that could be a make-or-break week for U.S. stock market. Investors also stayed focused on the outcome of earnings reports this week. </span>

		<title>Silver Fundamentals and the Gold/Silver Ratio</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> have recovered moderately over the past two weeks, yet still remain within the confines of the ongoing consolidations we have been monitoring over the last several months. For the week, gold rose 2.2% or $27 to close at $1,255 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile, silver posted a gain of 3.3% or $0.52 cents, to close at $16.46. Over the short run, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver's</a> recovery and close on a weekly basis above the key $16 level is certainly a positive sign that buyers remain ready to step in anytime the price drops into the $15’s.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is periodically beneficial to focus not only on gold and silver themselves in isolation but to examine the ratio between the two metals. In other words, we are referring to the number of ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a backdrop, readers should know that in general throughout history, a falling gold to silver ratio has tended to correspond with rising prices in both precious metals, whereas a rising gold to silver ratio has tended to correspond with falling prices in the metals. Of course, there are exceptions to every rule, but this is the prevailing trend that we observe when examining the ratio throughout history.</span>
<h3><b>Why does a falling gold to silver ratio correspond with rising gold and silver prices?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several reasons for this phenomenon. First, the silver market is extremely small compared to the gold market. For example, in 2016 just over 1 billion ounces of silver were produced from mining and scrap supply. Yet of this, approximately 80% or 800 million ounces were used for industrial fabrication: a combination of jewelry, silverware, electronics, solar panels, and photography. This silver was essentially “consumed” by industry or permanently taken off the market. What this means is that in 2016, only 200 million ounces were available for investment demand.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the industry has consumed the majority of silver for several decades, it is estimated that only 2-3 billion ounces exist above ground in readily investible form, meaning coins and bars. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare this to gold, in which the industrial demand is tiny in that only 16% of the 128 million ounces purchased in 2016 were used for fabrication. Of course, this means that 84% of the gold produced in 2016 is still available to the market in one form or another.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taken as a sum, we can see that in dollar terms, the total physical silver available in investible form pales in comparison to the total quantity of gold available. Most of the silver brought to market has been consumed by industry over the last 50 years. Not so with gold.</span>
<h3><b>What Happens in a Rising Gold Price Environment?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the much greater quantity of gold than silver that exists above ground for investment purposes, we must consider what happens in a rising precious metals price environment. Gold prices initially begin to rise due to purchases from larger players: central banks, institutions, sovereign wealth funds, and some forward-looking individuals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the rare exception (Warren Buffet bought 130 million ounces in 1998), silver is generally not the target of the central bank or institutional demand. Yet, importantly, silver is the target of individual investor demand. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The real power in the silver market lies in the potential for it to become the primary target for the individual investor. In a rising metals price backdrop, there will come a point when the average person does not have the resources available to purchase an ounce of gold. Where will he turn?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout history, the answer is silver.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine that an investor desires to move $10,000 into precious metals and that he chooses to split this investment evenly at 50% gold and 50% silver. With that split at today’s prices, he will just barely purchase 4 ounces of gold, yet over 300 ounces of silver (ignoring premiums). Again, let us remember that despite their vastly different values, there is more physical gold available above ground than silver. So here, by splitting a purchase evenly between the two metals, a single investor has taken possession of a much greater quantity of the world’s investable silver than of that for gold.</span>
<h3><b>What if 10% of the Population Wanted to Buy 10 Ounces of Silver?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now consider a scenario for the future, that as gold exceeds $1,500 in the years ahead, the average investor is largely priced out of the gold market. Again, where will he turn?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If 10% of the United States’ 320 million citizens each wanted to purchase 10 ounces of silver, the entire available investment supply for the year would be wiped out. What if 10% of the world’s 7.5 billion people each wanted to own 10 ounces? </span>
<h3><b>Returning to the Gold to Silver Ratio</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential for the precious metals, and especially silver, is significant over the years to come. While the ongoing corrections could continue for some time further, investors should carefully consider the underlying supply and demand fundamentals for the precious metals which will eventually exert themselves. In a rising gold price environment, silver will often lag initially, but when it does begin to gain interest from the average investor, even a modest inflow of capital into the “lesser” metal will have an oversized effect on its price. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We close with a long-term look at the gold to silver ratio. Currently, at 76 ounces of silver to purchase one ounce of gold, at the last precious metals peak in 1980, this ratio hit 17. As we can see, there have been several multi-year uptrends in favor of gold, amidst what appears to be a generational decline in the ratio (in favor of silver). Our expectation is that by the time the current cycle ends, the ratio will once again reach levels last seen in 1980.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>

Gold price increased on Friday after recovered economic reports from second-quarter. Among other precious metals: silver price is slightly higher, platinum is also up, palladium price dropped today.

Wall Street Indexes are trading lower on Friday, weighed down by the disappointing US companies earnings. Meanwhile, the US economy grew 2.6 % in the second quarter of the year; the U.S. Commerce Department announced earlier today.

Investors and market analytics keep watching the U.S. political landscape closely to any ultimate news from Trump’s Administration.

		<title>Daily Market Review - July, 31</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,269.30 (+0.24%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.91 (+0.23%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $943.60 (+0.13%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $898.30 (+1.12%), Dow Jones index 21,830.31 (0.15% increase)</i></b>

Here is a new week ahead with global financial markets’ focus on this week’s US employment report and how it will impact the Fed’s view on monetary policy through the end of the year. Market investors will also focus on a monetary policy decision from the Bank of England amid recent calls from policymakers for higher interest rates in the months ahead. This will be a busy week in the US as a new month begins. There is no Fed meeting in August so that investors will rely on U.S. economic data for a long-term direction and any boosts for US Dollar Index.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
US Dollar Index started this week on the higher level, but still couldn’t break its ongoing downtrend which was stable in the recent weeks. Stocks are focused on the positives of generally US companies earnings news, and any signs of improved economic activity.  Gold price climbed on early  Monday sessions, being steady and around its highest seven weeks level. Among other precious metals: silver price gained some points on Monday, platinum and palladium prices were also trading higher.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened mixed S&amp;P 500 2472.10 (-0.13%) and NASDAQ Index 6374.68 (-0.12%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21830.31 (+0.15%).</span>

Wall Street Indexes were higher on Monday, suggesting stock futures would close out one of its strongest months of 2017 with this start of the month.

The earning season has largely provided positive surprises for investors and helped stock market indexes to rise recently, even there is still a huge political tension. North Korea tested a new ballistic missile last week which landed in the Sea of Japan, raising concerns that more parts of the US could be at risk. President Trump announced that China should be doing more to control North Korea and that the US would rethink the economic and political lines to Asia for resolving a  North Korean problem in a peaceful manner.

		<title>US Dollar Approaching Critical Support</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important for precious metals investors to follow the valuation of the US dollar versus other foreign currencies because as a general principle, being the world’s reserve currency still to this day, when the dollar sees periods of rapid decline investors tend to seek safety… and some of that safety flow will move into precious metals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we chart the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies including the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, and the Canadian dollar. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the false breakout at multi-decade highs last January, the US dollar has declined with such ferocious momentum that it has surprised even our initial outlook from this past spring. Our initial target to the downside was 95.5 (green callout) and this level has not only been hit but exceeded. In the wake of a dovish indication from the Federal Reserve last week that it may not desire to “normalize” its balance sheet as quickly as many assumed, the USD has continued to plummet all the way down to the nearly 3-year “Critical Support Zone” labeled below in black. This zone extends from 91.9 to 93.1 on the dollar index.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2312 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/US-Dollar-Index.png" alt="US Dollar Index" width="830" height="491" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having closed at 93.1 for the week, the dollar is now effectively testing this critical support zone.</span>
<h3><b>Dollar Set for a Technical Bounce</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the short term, we would expect the dollar to bounce in this region. </span><b>The nature of the bounce will be important to monitor.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The false breakout pattern at a multi-decade high is a rare and significant technical signal for a possible long-term reversal, and so we expect that a bounce from current levels for the dollar will not be anything more than a relief rally, not to exceed the declining (dashed blue) downtrend line. This scenario is highlighted in green.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A less probable scenario would be that the dollar stages a more significant relief rally which breaks its new downtrend, but which does not exceed the resistance zone between 99.5 – 100.5.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The strength of the expected bounce will tell us much about the dollar going forward. Should the dollar stage a larger rally, it will be signaling that the decline we expect over the coming years will be slower and more grinding in nature, perhaps taking an equal 8-years to fall to all-time lows near 72 on the index, levels last seen in 2008.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, should the dollar merely show a weak bounce, staying below its new trendline, not exceeding 95.5 on the way higher and then plunging through the critical support zone, the stage will be set for a more immediate and precipitous drop in the US currency over just the next 12 months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Take, for example, the period to the far left of the chart from mid-2014 to early-2015, in which the dollar rose from 80 to 100.5 within eight months. It is entirely conceivable that in a precipitous dollar decline, the greenback could return just as quickly to the 79-80 region over a similar time frame. This would equate to nearly a 15% further drop in just a year.</span>
<h3><b>Long-Term Dollar Indicator</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider our monthly momentum indicator for the dollar, dating back to the mid-1980’s. According to this model, </span><b>the top just seen in the dollar was the most significant of the past 30 years, </b><b>registering an even more overbought reading than the 2001-2003 top</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For reference, recall that the decline which began in the dollar in 2001 at 118 on the index coincided with the all-time low in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> at $255 per ounce.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2313 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/US-Dollar-Index-Monthly.png" alt="US Dollar Index Monthly" width="1047" height="736" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider, too, that the decline which followed the 2001 top resulted in over a 40% loss in the value of the dollar in just six years. Were such a percentage decline to occur again from this greater-magnitude signal, the target would be 62 on the index by 2023, or of the Y-axis below the chart. </span>
<h3><b>Metals Have Not Responded to USD Weakness… Yet</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, what remains to be seen is: when do <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> begin to respond to the dollar’s decline? From 2003 – 2008, there was a strong day-to-day inverse correlation between the dollar and gold. Recently, however, precious metals traders have been largely ignoring the bulk of the decline in the US dollar up to this point.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When will traders begin to notice the decline in the world’s reserve currency? We cannot say for certain, but we will begin to pick up the change in behavior when it registers on the charts, as we should begin to see $10 - $20 spikes in gold on specific days when the dollar falls by 0.5% - 1.0% on the index.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whichever form the pending bounce takes will tell us much about the strength or lack thereof for the dollar to be expected over the next several years.</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - August,1</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,268.20 (+0.22%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.79 (-0.29%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $948.00 (+0.81%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $897.00 (+1.18%), Dow Jones index 21,955.67 (0.29% increase)</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
The U.S. dollar index increased on Tuesday, presenting a slight recovery after 15-month low hit, however investors continue to be concerned about weak dollar index, U.S. inflation and reduced bets on the Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes. Low US inflation is likely to encourage the U.S. Fed to consider another interest rate hike before the end of this year. Gold price increased on Tuesday, supported by the uncertainness in the future direction of US currency and soft inflation. Investors are looking ahead to the US non-farm payrolls data later this week and how that could affect the dollar. Among other precious metals: silver slightly lower today, palladium and platinum prices are also higher.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2475.08 (+0.19%) and NASDAQ Index 6359.51 (+0.17%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21955.67 (+0.29%).</span>

Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today, supported by the latest economic reports and geopolitical tension. Donald Trump announced on Monday that U.S. would “handle” North Korea, which has tested ballistic missiles.

The biggest news investors are waiting for today- “bitcoin cash”. The digital currency specialists officially completed the process to split the currency in two. The analytics confirmed the official coding the new bitcoin cash blockchain starts on Tuesday. Analysts estimated the divide into bitcoin and "bitcoin cash" would also occur later today.

		<title>Bitcoin has forked creating the new Bitcoin Cash</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The leading digital currency has officially forked today. Bitcoin power brokers couldn’t adopt a single solution which would have preserved the integrity of the famous cryptocurrency, forcing it to split in Bitcoin and the newly created Bitcoin Cash, causing BTC trade slightly lower this Tuesday morning.</span>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">**</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The civil war between developers and miners over Bitcoin’s future has caused the well-known cryptocurrency to fork today. While core developers wanted to keep bitcoin network’s blocks intact to protect it from hacks, some miners have aggressively promoted their solution of speeding up the network by increasing the block’s size.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The risk of getting Bitcoin transactions stuck in limbo for hours or days, therefore, increasing the next blocks’ cost (since the miners’ fee will also get higher), determined the Bitcoin community to come up with a new solution of speeding up the Bitcoin transactions’ approval process by forking the digital currency.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A fork is a "change to the software of the digital currency that creates two separate versions of the blockchain with a shared history." There were disagreements on whether to adopt a soft or hard fork – to create a new chain and ‘wipe out’ the weakest one or to permanently split the chain and create two Bitcoin versions. In the end, the hard fork was the one adopted after Tuesday’s morning deadline, generating a new Bitcoin – the Bitcoin Cash. The major difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is the block size, 1MB vs. 8MB, which is a promise of a faster transaction approval.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The hard fork created an identical blockchain, so it mirrored the people’s existing bitcoin wealth in Bitcoin Cash. The new digital currency was immediately bootstrapped by in-built value. Futures for the new Bitcoin gave back all of an initial 48% hike to $422 but traded 12% lower near $255 as of 1:53 PM, ET.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Forks had occurred in cryptocurrencies before, like the Bitcoin's rival, Ethereum, which also forked in 2016 and created the form of the digital currency we know today. Bitcoin miners have been able to mine for new bitcoins since this morning yet the first Bitcoin cash was reportedly mined at about 2:20 PM. Some analysts noted that Bitcoin Cash required the same amount of computational work as the original Bitcoin, but a significantly smaller number of miners are trying to create the new cryptocurrency.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Cash’s larger block size may prompt investors to forsake Bitcoin in new currency’s favor, which would be negative for the price of the original Bitcoin. Since the Bitcoin Cash has drawn its initial value from Bitcoin's market capitalization, it caused the bitcoin's value slightly drop after its adoption. Though, the entire market is still keeping an eye on the Bitcoin Cash to see " how the situation evolves."</span>

<em><strong>Important: Despite the fork, please keep in mind that if you want to <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/how-to/buy-gold-with-bitcoin">buy gold with Bitcoin</a> at Bullion Exchanges still accepts only the regular Bitcoin (BTC).</strong></em>]]></content>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar index lost some points on Thursday, but seem to be back on the rebounding track ahead of the  U.S. Department of Labor will announce the jobless claims today. The dollar remained under pressure over political turmoil in Washington and recent weak economic reports, which have raised doubts over the strength of US economy. Gold price dropped today from the near seven-week highs hit. Investors consider that US economy will likely to be strong enough for the Fed to increase rates in September. Among other precious metals: silver price slightly decreased, platinum price is also trading higher palladium price also dropped.  </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2474.14 (-0.14%) and NASDAQ Index 6349.78 (-0.19%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22029.44 (+0.06%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today after the Dow Jones Average broke the 22,000 level for the first time in its 121-year history. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A bunch of factors weigh down stock markets this week: the prospect of a hike in U.S. interest rates later this year; worries over China’s rising debt; a U.S. employment report for July that will be released Friday; weaker commodity prices; and tensions between Beijing and Washington over a hostile North Korea. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new ban on travel by US passport holders to North Korea will take effect on September,1. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bank of England will announce its latest interest rate decision on Thursday. It will also release its quarterly inflation report, offering a detailed picture of the British economy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index looks steady today after being </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">near 15-month lows hit earlier this week.The dollar weakening on news of developments in the ongoing US elections investigations also assisted gold quite a bit. However,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investors suggest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">greenback could present unique opportunities for Wall Street Indexes. Gold price significantly dropped today,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">as the US reported stronger-than-expected jobs data for July. Investors are cautious ahead of the upcoming economic data on Friday and that is why it's been a bit messy in morning session. Among other precious metals: silver slightly dropped today, palladium price is also down, meanwhile platinum price is trading higher.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2478.79 (+0.27%) and NASDAQ Index 6356.39 (+0.22%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22074.75 (+0.22%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">after the closely watched July jobs report came in stronger than expected yesterday</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">America has added more than a  million new jobs since President Trump took office. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. economy added a strong 209,000 jobs in July, more than economists had expected. The unemployment rate fell to 4.3%, matching a 16-year low. Just after the Great Recession in 2009, unemployment peaked at 10%.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average crossed the 22,000 mark for the first time.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Now </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">markets are awaiting July's employment report, due later in the session, for clues on whether it will impact the timing of the US Federal Reserve's policy tightening. </span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - August, 7</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,258.10 (-0.15%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.23 (-0.61%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $973.00 (+0.36%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $879.65 (-0.45%), Dow Jones index 22,093.24 (0.03% increase)</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a new week ahead with a  focus on U.S. several important economic data points, with  Friday inflation report, which may affect the timing of the next Federal Reserve rate hike. Several Fed speakers are also scheduled this week, which could bring us more insights about the central bank monetary policy. This week also brings a rare quiet moment in politics, with President Trump on a 17-day vacation.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
US Dollar Index is trading lower today, compared with the last week when greenback was supported by the stronger-than-expected jobs data last week. Gold price slightly dropped at the beginning of the week, weighed down by recovering US Dollar. Investors think gold is going to trade in a very tight range this week, because of the low level of liquidity in the market due to the holidays in Asia. Among other precious metals: platinum climbed today, silver price and palladium price decreased at the beginning of the week.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2476.77 (+0.01%) and NASDAQ Index 6360.47 (+0.15%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22093.24 (+0.03%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today, Dow Jones Industrial Average </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hit an intraday record shortly after opening Monday, adding to last week's record-setting performance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week will be filled with retail companies releasing quarterly results, which continue to be supportive for stocks. Economic data have also been mostly positive lately. Last week, the Labor Department announced the U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs last month, much more than expected that likely clear the way for the Fed to announce a plan to start shrinking its massive bond portfolio. </span>

<b>Economic data for this week:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Consumer credit </span><b>(Monday), Job openings</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Tuesday), Wholesale inventories </span><b>(Wednesday),</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Weekly jobless claim </span><b>(Thursday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Consumer Price Index </span><b>(Friday).</b>

		<title>Are Gold and the Japanese Yen Equal? (Part I)</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In past articles, we have discussed the generally-antagonistic relationship between <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold </a>and the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/31/us-dollar-approaching-critical-support/">US dollar</a>. Still to this day the world’s reserve currency, as precious metals investors we must always keep a close eye on the value of the dollar, as gold stands to be a primary beneficiary if in fact the dollar ever loses a significant amount of value in the future.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the value of the dollar versus all foreign currencies must regularly be considered, there is one cross-pair that deserves special attention for its relationship with gold. And that is the dollar versus the Japanese yen. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise labeled “JPY/USD”, we are hereby referring to the value of the Japanese yen as priced in US dollars. How is JPY/USD related to gold?</span>
<h3><b>JPY/USD and Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The clearest way to show the importance of the JPY/USD cross-pair and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is to plot a direct comparison between the two. Below we show JPY/USD (multiplied by 100 for scale) on top, with the price of gold immediately below, since the 2011 peak in gold at $1,923 per ounce:</span>

<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2353" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Japanese-Yen_comparison.png" alt="Japanese Yen_comparison" width="531" height="549" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The similarity between these two charts is striking. For example, note how the absolute highs for both gold at $1,923 per ounce and for JPY/USD at 1.32 occurred in Q3 2011. Note too how the large drop in gold which occurred between October 2012 and June 2013 when the metal fell from $1,800 down to $1,175 coincided precisely with the JPY/USD decline from 1.30 down to 0.98. Both continued to bring lower until 2015.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both assets also surged simultaneously during the first half of 2016, only to give back much of those gains in tandem during the second half of the year.</span>
<h3><b>Ratio Plot</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to view the relationship between these two assets is in the form of a ratio. Below we plot JPY/USD divided by the price of gold, since 1998. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In plain English, this ratio asks: “How does the value of the Japanese yen compare to the value of gold?”</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2354" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Japanese-Gold-ratio.png" alt="Japanese ,Gold ratio" width="1144" height="588" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see that over time the graph has moved lower. This means that over the past two decades the Japanese yen has lost considerable value versus gold; in other words, gold has risen as priced in yen. This should generally be expected, as we know all fiat currencies are being debased by their respective central banks over time.</span>
<h3><b>The Yen / Gold Correlation</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">What is perhaps not so expected is to see the tight correlation since late-2011 that has developed between the Japanese yen and the price of gold.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This correlation can be seen on the lower right corner of the chart via the blue converging trendlines, with the nearly flat price action since 2011.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When a ratio such as this flat lines, it tells us that the two components are highly positively correlated: the two assets are moving closely in tandem. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this instance, the flat line in the ratio confirms that the Japanese yen to US dollar cross pair is behaving nearly identically to the price of gold. In other words, </span><b>since 2011 the yen and gold are behaving as the same asset class.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The proof for this statement is visible in the first set of charts that we have shown.</span>
<h3><b>Yen and Gold – the Same?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, fundamentally we know that the Japanese yen and gold are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the same asset classes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, one is a fiat currency which may be printed ad infinitum by a central bank, while the other is a finite element which has served as a store of wealth for at least 5,000 years.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundamentally, the yen and gold are certainly not equal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, as we see from the graphs above, the market is treating the two as essentially the same since 2011. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are we, as investors, to make the nearly perfect correlation between the Japanese currency and gold? Why are these two markets so tightly intertwined? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, when will the correlation cease, and how can we use this knowledge in our investment plans going forward?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will address these questions and more in Part II of this series on the Japanese yen versus gold, next week…</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index edged slightly lower on Tuesday against the bucket of the major currencies, following the aftermath of the last week economic data. The greenback continues to be supported by strong nonfarm payrolls data, which met expectations that Fed will follow its plan for a third rate hike this year. Gold price is higher today as the dollar is still weak and there is no full clarity about Fed monetary policy. Among other precious metals: silver rose today, platinum and palladium also gained points. Palladium touched its highest level over the week in a  previous session.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2481.74 (+0.03%) and NASDAQ Index 6386.19 (+0.04%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22129.03 (+0.05%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today, with investors waiting for US inflation numbers later this week. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive economic data and strong company earnings have helped nudge the stock market mostly higher in recent weeks. Market analytics have welcomed the positive earning growth by pushing the market indexes further.  </span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,274.80 (+0.46%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.88 (+0.80%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $982.50 (+0.24%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $989.35 (-0.44%), Dow Jones index 22,046.92 (0.30% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
US Dollar turned on positive track on Wednesday after the stronger-than-expected economic data from the Labor Department yesterday and market speculation about future Fed interest rates. Gold price increased today because of the rising tension between the United States and North Korea. On Wednesday North Korea announced the possible plan for a missile strike on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, just a few minutes after Donald Trump said that any threat to the United States would be met with “fire and fury.” Investors think that North Korea situation will continue to provide little support for prices but not enough to push them significantly higher. However, geopolitical risks can boost demand for safe haven assets such as gold. Among other precious metals: silver slightly rose today, platinum gained a few points, palladium decreased.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2465.52 (-0.36%) and NASDAQ Index 6324.03 (-0.71%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22046.92 (-0.30%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street indexes dropped today weighed down by the geopolitical situation between the U.S. and North Korea. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tensions have risen since North Korea carried out two nuclear bomb tests last year and two ICBM tests last month.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The ratcheting up of tensions rattled global financial markets and prompted warnings from U.S. officials and analysts not to engage in rhetorical slanging matches with North Korea.</span>

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wholesale inventories, Unit Labor costs.</span>]]></content>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar index is trading slightly higher today being supported by yesterday’s market volatility.The strong economic data recently increased the chances of a next Fed rate hike later in the year, but they became weaker after increasing tensions between North Korea and the United States. Based on today’s early morning news the U.S.Dollar is not being treated as a safe-haven asset. Meanwhile, geopolitical uncertainty keeps gold price on a high-level today. All the other main precious metals also increased today.</span>

		<title>Are Gold and the Japanese Yen Equal? (Part II)</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/07/are-gold-and-the-japanese-yen-equal-part-i/">Part 1 of this series</a> last week, we examined the relationship between the Japanese yen and gold. We showed that both yen and gold have been highly correlated since 2011, moving closely in tandem during both corrections and surges since their respective peaks nearly six years ago.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As precious metals investors, what are we to make of this correlation? And how can we use the correlation to our advantage in the future?</span>
<h3><b>Why Does the Correlation Exist?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, let us address the “why” behind the yen/<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> correlation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line is that no one truly knows why the correlation exists because correlations between diverse asset classes never exist for solely one reason. Anyone who claims to have “the” answer in reality only has one of the said answers – because markets are made up millions of individuals, each acting on their own particular causes and assumptions. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, we can look to identify some contributing causes. Much of the correlation has to do with the perceived safety status of the Japanese yen. Although still a fiat currency, the yen in recent years has come to be known in the international trade as one of the safest currencies in the world, perhaps even more so than the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/31/us-dollar-approaching-critical-support/">US dollar. </a></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan is notable for its low inflation relative to other developed world economies. Although the country has a large public debt, much of that debt is held domestically by investors. Japan also has a significant trade surplus, selling more to foreign trade partners than it imports. The yen-carry trade, a popular funding mechanism of the past decade in which investors borrow Japanese yen to buy assets in foreign countries, is a testament to the perceived stability of the Japanese economy and its ultra-low interest rates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these reasons contribute to the safe-haven status of the yen, which in turn drives the correlation with gold.</span>
<h3><b>Looking for Confirmation Signals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there is a myriad of reasons why the correlation is in place, for our purposes it will be more valuable to accept that it does indeed exist, and to next look for ways to utilize this information. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the more valuable forms of analysis we can thereby perform is to monitor for either confirmation or non-confirmation signals between the yen to dollar cross-pair (JPY/USD) and gold. These can help us gauge major turning points in the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in June 2015 gold began to make new lows under the $1,200/oz mark, eventually hitting $1,045 in December of that year. However, note that the Japanese yen failed to make a new similar low, instead of increasing marginally from 0.7950 to 0.8125 during this time:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2394" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Jap-Yen-to-US-Dollar.png" alt="Jap Yen to US Dollar" width="652" height="685" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall the main chart from last week’s article, showing the near perfect correlation over six years between the pair. Here in 2015 was a non-confirmation signal for gold’s final plunge in 2015. The yen and gold were, in fact, moving in opposite directions as a net sum over the final months of the decline.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What did this non-confirmation in the yen signal for gold? We will let the charts speak for themselves, by extending out the above by another seven months:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2395" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Japanese-Yen-to-US-Dollar.png" alt="Japanese Yen to US Dollar" width="645" height="691" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is clear that the non-confirmation signal in the yen in late 2015 was an excellent predictor of what is now seen as the final low for gold’s 2011 – 2015 bear market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an important signal for those who are interested in gauging likely turning points in the gold market. Of course, no signal will be perfect 100% of the time. But we can push the odds of probability into our favor for the gold market if we pay attention to these confirmation or non-confirmation signals in the Japanese yen.</span>
<h3><b>Watch for the Correlation to End</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A final point on the topic for the time being: no correlation will last forever. There will come a time when – for fundamental reasons which will only be revealed after the fact – the tight correlation between the yen and gold will sever.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What more, the </span><b>period of time following the breaking of this relationship will be important for precious metals investors to pay attention to</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because it will signify either a rapid acceleration higher in the price of gold, or a severe plunge, depending on the direction in which the correlation breaks. To illustrate, refer to the following set of imbedded charts of the yen/gold ratio:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2396" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Japanese-Yen-and-Gold-ratio.png" alt="Japanese Yen and Gold ratio" width="932" height="874" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will know the correlation is ending when the yen/gold ratio breaks either above or below the converging set of (blue) trendlines which have defined the relationship since 2011. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When zoomed in (bottom chart), due to the extension of the y-axis on this timescale, it appears that there is much variability which can still occur in the confines of this relationship. However, when we refer back to the original (top) chart, we can see that in the grand scheme of these two asset classes, the correlation is still very tight indeed. A breaking point could come at any time within the next 12-24 months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the convergence breaks higher (less likely) it will signify that the yen is set to gain value relative to gold. Conversely, if the ratio breaks lower (more likely) it will hint that after six years gold is finally ready to resume leadership amongst the safe-haven assets again, with a price rise in all currencies including the yen.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
The US Dollar Index seems steady enough on Wednesday after strong US retail sales economic data confirm the<span style="font-weight: 400;"> chance of another Federal Reserve rate hike this year and while Asia stocks inched slowly as North Korea delayed a decision on firing towards Guam. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, gold price is trading lower on Wednesday as the dollar steadied with investors and traders are waiting for the Fed’s  minutes of the last meeting scheduled for today. Among other precious metals: silver slightly increased, platinum price is also higher, palladium price is mostly unchanged.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2469.68 (+0.21%) and NASDAQ Index 6343.32 (+0.18%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22056.60 (+0.26%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street indexes seem pretty positive on Wednesday, as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. retail sales announced their biggest increase in seven months in July. The economic data is very supportive for the market and helped U.S. stocks touch its higher level. Investors consider this jump as a market’s rebounding in the last sessions after a standoff between the United States and North Korea. </span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
The US Dollar edged higher against the major currencies on Thursday, supported by the latest economic reports. The greenback gained points after yesterday's data showed that the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week was less than expected. The key results of the Fed meeting in July also helped US Dollar to rise. Gold price increased on Thursday after it’s been pressured by a significant tension between North Korea and the United States earlier this week. Among other precious metals: silver price is slightly increased, platinum price is also higher, palladium price reached its one of the highest levels in last weeks.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2460.30 (-0.31%) and NASDAQ Index 6320.19 (-0.39%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21973.75 (-0.23%). </span>

Wall Street Indexes dropped lower today after President Trump announced that he would disband his advisory councils filled with leaders of corporate giants. The results of Fed's July meeting showed a split among FOMC members who wanted to keep the course and continue to raise rates and those who preferred the Fed slow down the process. Investors hope Fed will finally take a path for normalizing interest rates.

Wall Street traders expect to see if the retailer is making progress in the upcoming reports today.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
US Dollar Index dropped down today after news of a terrorist attack in Barcelona combined with Wall Street indexes going lower. The market was also distracted by the news that Gary Cohn was resigning as an economic adviser to President Donald Trump, but the White House didn’t confirm this information. Gold price moved higher but was still below the previous high levels. Among other precious metals: silver price was mostly unchanged, platinum and palladium prices are also up.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2424.47 (-0.23%) and NASDAQ Index 6216.12 (-0.13%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21721.76 (-0.13%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street indexes dropped down on Friday after Spain attack and political news that an economic adviser to President Donald Trump might resign. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Market participants are still focused today on the terror attack in Spain with a van plowing into crowds in one of Barcelona’s busiest venues, killing at least 14 people. European stocks were also sharply lower on Friday following the attacks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">US traders are mostly keeping an eye on the international news, because US Congress is currently on its summer recess, and this gives a little less political tension.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the main market’s uncertainty leads to the same doubts over whether the Fed will be able to raise rates again this year and clearly investors are growing more nervous about this concern.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,290.90 (+0.56%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.14 (+0.81%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $990.50 (+0.64%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $936.60 (+0.99%), Dow Jones index 21,657.63 (0.08% decrease).</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a new week ahead with a pretty quiet week for economic data, but with a new reason for investors' nervousness-changes within the Trump's Administration. Friday’s unexpected exit of Steve Bannon dominated investors attention. The President’s closest political advisor no longer has an access to the White House. The investors will also keep an eye on Central bankers annual meeting in Jackson Hole.The meeting will take place Thursday through Friday with the highlight being a speech about financial stability from Janet Yellen on Friday.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
The US Dollar Index is getting lower on Monday. Last week U.S. dollar held its ground against most of the major currencies. The prospect of escalating military tensions has been a key driver for the dollar recently. Gold price is little changed today as investors are waiting for the further direction after the last week of geopolitical uncertainty in the US and Europe terroristic attack and also ahead of the Central bankers’ meeting later this week. The gold reached its highest level since November on Friday. Among other precious metals: silver price is slightly higher, platinum and palladium prices are also up.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened mixed S&amp;P 500 2427.10 (+0.05%) and NASDAQ Index 6220.84(+0.07%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21657.63 (-0.08%). </span>

US stock indexes are trading mixed today, but mostly lower. Some analysts suggest that geopolitical tension and surprises in Washington have been keeping market away from the recovering path.

There are a few President Donald Trump’s speeches this week: the first one is about a path for U.S. strategy in Afghanistan in a nationally televised speech on Monday. On Tuesday, Donald Trump is scheduled to speak at a campaign-style rally in Phoenix as a response to the white-supremacist violence in Charlottesville.

Markets are also looking ahead to a top central bankers meeting later this week in Jackson Hole, where U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's speech will be monitored for clues on further interest rate hikes this year. The outcome of this meeting could affect both the gold price, because it is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, as much as the US Dollar Index.

<b>Economic data for this week: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago National Activity index </span><b>(Monday), </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing scheduled </span><b>(Tuesday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, New Home Sales </span><b>(Wednesday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Weekly jobless claims, Existing  Home Sales </span><b>(Thursday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Durable Goods Orders </span><b>(Friday).</b>

		<title>Gold Breakout – Higher Targets in Sight</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks ago <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> broke higher through the long-term declining downtrend which has defined the period of falling prices since 2011. That year, gold peaked at $1,923 per ounce, while <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> peaked just shy of $50. Over the past six years, despite many attempts to gather momentum to the upside, gold has been unable to overcome this key technical resistance level. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the surge of first-half 2016, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> has made no less than seven attempts to overcome this downtrend. Those attempts are highlighted on the chart below by the magenta-colored arrows. Each time gold reached this declining trend, sellers showed up, and forced the price back lower – sometimes by only $40 - $50 per ounce, yet sometimes by over $200 per ounce, as was seen last November.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2441" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Gold-2011-present.png" alt="Gold 2011- present" width="1060" height="793" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold has now made its most legitimate breakout attempt – and furthermore, it has sustained the breakout for two full weeks. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we examine price projections, we must note that for the breakout to remain valid, </span><b>prices must remain above $1,260 on a daily closing basis</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If this level were to fail, it would invalidate the breakout, and we would have (once again) another failed attempt. False-moves are possible in all markets, and the best way to handle them is to have a defined price point whereby if a failure occurs, we can examine alternate scenarios. Again, $1,260 must hold – and thus far, prices have done so.</span>
<h3><b>Breakout Importance</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of this trend break should not be underestimated. Many technical-based buyers have remained on the sidelines for the past six years as gold prices moved lower and then drifted sideways. A sustained break above a declining trendline is often a signal that investors will use to tell them the period of falling prices is likely over. We expect these investors will begin entering the gold market in the near future, and momentum will begin to build.</span>
<h3><b>Short-Term Resistance Levels</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next several weeks, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/05/gold-a-large-move-is-approaching/">gold</a> still must overcome the $1,300 zone as initial resistance. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,300 has held prices lower since the reversal which took place on the night of Trump’s victory, last November. This is presently the third attempt for gold to overcome this price, and each attempt represents a “chipping away” by buyers at the overhang of sellers who are exiting their positions near break even. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What will typically happen as a specific horizontal resistance level is preparing to be broken is that the reactions lower on each failure will become less and less severe, indicating buyers are stepping in at higher price points at every sell-off. In the near future, we expect $1,300 will be broken – and at that point, a whole new class of buyers will begin paying attention to the precious metals market.</span>
<h3><b>Intermediate Price Targets</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming gold can remain above $1,260 and soon recapture $1,300, thus solidifying the long-term downtrend break, we have much higher price targets ahead over the next 6-18 months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Three specific price targets occur within a close proximity, and this confluence represents our highest probability target:</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consolidation which took place from December 2015 through August 2017 featured an amplitude of $330 per ounce, from the low of $1,045 to the high of $1,375. This consolidation took place in the form of a giant triangle-shaped formation. In technical analysis when triangle-consolidation breaks, the target is derived from an equal measurement of the amplitude ($330), added onto the apex of the triangle ($1,205). This calculation gives a target of $1,535. </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is clear horizontal resistance visible on the chart at $1,525 (black line). This level formerly acted as support in 2011 – 2013 and then failed on the fourth test in early 2013. Generally, defined former support levels will subsequently act as resistance on the next attempt to overcome them as sellers emerge.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire 2011 – 2015 decline comes in at $1,485. Fibonacci was an Italian mathematician of the 12</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century who discovered that many aspects of nature – sea shells, hurricanes, flower petals – all follow a similar ratio pattern. Financial markets often follow these similar patterns, the markets being a component of (human) nature.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, </span><b>we have three strong technical targets between $1,485 - $1,535, and this level represents our highest probability for a future intermediate gold peak</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These targets should be reached within 6-18 months, depending on the host of geopolitical and market factors impacting the precious metals. These represent starting targets only, at which point new analysis will be required.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming gold maintains above $1,260 in the coming weeks, this technical breakout is significant and bears monitoring by investors. We expect that when $1,300 is broken, momentum will begin to pick up notably on the way to the higher targets. Investors may choose to accelerate a certain percentage of purchases as fitting in with an overall investment plan.</span>

Here is a new week ahead of a busy economic data scheduled to release regarding inflation, jobs, and manufacturing followed by the Kansas City Federal Reserve’s central-banker conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. In speeches at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank’s symposium in Jackson Hole, Janet Yellen will be focused on banking regulations and economic improvements in the U.S. economy. US market participants are also trying to analyze the damage from Hurricane Harvey in Texas. The biggest issue that the Texas coast in general accounts for 30% of the entire oil refining capacity of the U.S., and almost 15% are from the region most directly affected by the storm.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
The US Dollar Index dropped lower near 92.30 today, following the speech by Chief J.Yellen at the Jackson Hole Symposium on Friday. The greenback is also pressured after U.S. President Donald Trump suggested a shutdown of the government and threatened<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Gold </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prices turned higher today extending gains from the previous session after US Federal Reserve Chair J. Yellen made no reference to US monetary policy in a speech at bankers meeting last week. Among other precious metals: silver edged up, platinum and palladium also rose today.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading mixed today, giving a slow start to a busy economic data week for investors. After Friday’s speech from Fed chair, market analytics will closely look at the jobs report this week. This week’s calendar also features U.S. data on personal income and spending.Markets continue to be skeptical that the Fed will raise rates a third time this year due to worries over the subdued inflation outlook. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most market headlines on Monday are focused on the hurricane Harvey in Texas, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blew through critical areas for the country’s oil and gas industry and has already caused some disruptions in production. Several companies announced that they are shutting down operations their refining and petrochemical complexes because of flooding. The reports say Harvey has already knocked out 11% of U.S. refining capacity.</span>

		<title>Thoughts on Precious Metals as Summer Winds Down</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">As summer winds down in the northern hemisphere, first and foremost our thoughts and prayers go out to those who are being impacted by the destruction of Hurricane Harvey in Texas.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer tends to be the slowest time of year for most of the financial markets. The phrase “sell in May and go away” summarizes the strategy that many traders take of exiting their positions at the end of the spring and not returning until after Labor Day. Although the precious metals occupy a unique space within the investment world, some of these same seasonal factors do impact the prices of the metals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us examine the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> seasonality chart, showing average monthly returns since 1975:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2477 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/a_seasonal.png" alt="Gold seasonality" width="681" height="344" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we can see, the May through July period is historically the slowest of the year for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, featuring not only the lowest volatility but often an important price low forming in July.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The strong seasonal period begins in August and continues through September, largely as a result of physical demand from the Indian wedding and Chinese holiday seasons. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we should point out that after what is typically a weak month in October, gold still has four strong months ahead through February. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, the August through February period is the strongest time for precious metals historically, and we are now at the beginning of that period, with gold already having broken through its long-term downtrend technical resistance (<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/21/gold-breakout-higher-targets-in-sight/">see the article</a>, last week).</span>
<h3><b>Volatility Remains at Record Lows</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us not forget, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold</a> is approaching its strongest period of the year amidst what is still the lowest daily volatility observed over the past nine years. Below we update gold’s volatility chart:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2478 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b_vol.png" alt="Gold Index" width="686" height="266" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility is a direction-neutral measure. In other words, it only tells us that a period of higher volatility is set to follow, but not in which direction the upcoming moves will occur. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When we juxtapose strong seasonality factors emerging amidst a market that is within record-low volatility and already showing initial hints of technical breakouts, what we can say is that the precious metals are set for strong moves ahead. Our initial assessment is that those moves will be higher, but we will not take anything for granted and always keep one eye on the charts on a regular basis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The charts we feature here focus primarily on the “what” aspect of the market – they do not tell us the “why”. The metals are like dry tinder at present with lightning visible in the distance. The market is waiting for a spark… what could that be?</span>
<h3><b>Potential Sparks for Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tensions are brewing amongst US economic policymakers, and Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, gave an example of that on Friday. In a speech at the economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Yellen discussed the role that the US central bank had in propping up the financial system after the crash of 2008 through bailouts and increased regulation. The most prescient quote from the speech was as follows:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><b>Because of the reforms that strengthened our financial system</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>and with support from monetary and other policies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, credit is available on good terms, and lending has advanced broadly in line with economic activity in recent years, contributing to today’s strong economy.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we see Yellen hinting that she will not favor the loosening of regulations that were enacted after the financial crisis of 2008, something the Trump administration has pushed for in recent months. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yellen’s term as chairwoman is up this February and speculation is that Trump may not re-nominate her for the position. The speech at Jackson Hole tends to reinforce that a shakeup may be coming at the Fed early next year. And uncertainty in the financial system tends to provide support for gold.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, saber-rattling continues between the United States and North Korea. While gold price spikes based on the fear of isolated geopolitical events tend to not be sustained, certainly if any sort of extended political or military confrontation were to develop between these two nuclear powers, gold would see a sustained bid. At what point do these idle threats that we see quoted so often begin to be taken seriously by one side or the other?</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2479" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/c_korea-1.png" alt="" width="620" height="313" />
<h3><b>Takeaway on the End of Summer and Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial technical breakouts have already been observed on the charts in recent weeks.  Gold is entering its historically-strongest period of the year due to seasonal demand from India and China, amidst a backdrop of decade-low volatility. The precious metals are set to react strongly when a fundamental spark presents itself. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy your final week of the summer!  </span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,309.20 (-0.64%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.44 (-1.14%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $995.50 (-1.13%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $936.70 (-1.26%), Dow Jones index 21,865.37 (0.26% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar Index is trading at the higher level on Wednesday after touching the lowest levels since January earlier this week.The greenback is still weighted down by the stronger euro and geopolitical tensions after North Korea’s missile launch. Meanwhile, gold price slipped today pressured by gains in the dollar, despite demand for safe-haven from investors. The dollar strength is taking points from the yellow metal. Among other precious metals: silver price decreased today, platinum and palladium prices also dropped.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2446.60 (+0.08%) and NASDAQ Index 6301.89(+0.30%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21865.37 (+0.26%).</span>

Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today after North Korea conducted a test of an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) to counter US and South Korean military drills.

Market analytics consider the tension between North Korea and the US reached levels unseen since 1994. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that “All options are on the table.”

However, the U.S. economy is looking stronger anyway, especially on the jobs front. Private employers added 237,000 working positions in August, according to the report released on Wednesday.

		<title>Daily Market Review - August, 31</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,310.70 (+0.27%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.50 (-0.34%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $992.40 (-0.22%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $938.05 (+0.09%), Dow Jones index 21,892.43 (0.12% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index is trading higher on Thursday against all major currencies, and it’s one more advance for greenback this week. Later today, investors will be focused on important economic reports, which could also drive US Dollar ( Core PCE Price Index, Personal Spending, and Personal Income). Gold price seems steady on Thursday, despite the stronger US Dollar and positive economic data. Among other precious metals: silver price slightly increased today, platinum price is down, palladium price is trading higher. </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2457.59 (+0.46%) and NASDAQ Index 6368.31(+1.05%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21892.43 (+0.12%).</span>

Wall Street indexes are trading higher on Thursday after inflation data raised expectations that Federal Reserve will hold off from increasing interest rates again this year. The weekly data precedes the more comprehensive monthly jobs report on Friday, which will help investors gauge the strength of the labor market as they look for clues on the Fed's next move on rates. North Korea recently conducted a missile test over Japan airspace, adding to tensions in the global political platform.

However, Mr.Trump talked up the latest speech on Wednesday in Springfield, Mo., laying out his plans for tax overhaul. Despite nearly uniform skepticism from mainstream economists, he insisted that much faster economic growth was within reach.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">

		<title>Celebrate Canada’s 150th Anniv. with unique Voyageur coins</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Canada marks its sesquicentennial  150th anniversary by releasing two exclusive pieces: the beautiful </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-1-oz-canadian-gold-150th-annv-voyageur-coin-in-assay">2017 $150 1 oz. 99.99% Pure Gold Canada 150 Special Edition Voyageur Coin </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-1-oz-silver-canadian-150th-annv-voyageur-coin">2017 $5 1 oz. Fine Silver Canada 150 Special Edition Voyageur Coin</a><b>. </b>Canadian Confederation was united into one Dominion of Canada on July 1, 1867. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Both coins feature the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">iconic “Voyageur” design originally created for 1935-1986 Canadian Silver Dollars.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">**</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the last summer day, the renowned Royal Canadian Mint delights its fans with two spectacular issues: the </span><b>2017 $150 1 oz. 99.99% Pure Gold Canada 150 Special Edition Voyageur Coin </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><b>2017 $5 1 oz. Fine Silver Canada 150 Special Edition Voyageur Coin </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">which bear on their reverse the legendary “Voyageur” image created by the talented Toronto sculptor - Emanuel Hahn.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The coin's design showcases a voyageur and a Native paddling a superb canoe swiftly moving past the windswept pines that dot a semi-circular island. Between them is a bundle of wrapped furs marked with “HB” as for Hudson’s Bay Company. In the background, stylized vertical rays represent the northern lights up the sky. This splendid image is a powerful nod to the industry which founded Canada, the fur trade industry, and was designed for the Canadian Voyageur Silver Dollar coins struck between 1935 and 1986. An astonishing symbol of Canadian character and spirit, these impressive coins were the first circulating silver dollars in Canada and were introduced to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of King George V.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The obverse sides of the Canada 150 anniversary releases carry the famous effigy of Her Majesty, created by Susanna Blunt, and the unique RCM bullion security features: the radial line background pattern and micro-engraved “17” maple leaf privy mark. Both coins are Canadian legal tender, have a weight of one troy ounce, struck from .9999 fine <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and .9999 fine <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, with their weight and purity backed by the Government of Canada.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>2017 $5 1 oz. 99.99% Pure Silver Canada 150 Special Edition Voyageur Coin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bears the highest denomination seen on a 1 oz. silver bullion coin - $5 CAD while the </span><b>2017 $150 1 oz. Fine Gold Canada 150 Special Edition Voyageur Coin </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">carries the first-ever face value for a 1 oz. .9999 gold bullion coin - $150 CAD. The <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> piece also has a limited issue of just 15,000 coins and is housed in a fantastic assay card featuring the official Canada 150 emblem and the beautiful aurora borealis. These wonderful features make the coins a treasured addition to any bullion portfolio and a great gift for any RCM fan.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - September, 5</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,332.90 (+0.20%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.98 (+1.30%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $1012.00 (+0.85%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $985.60 (+1.22%), Dow Jones index 21,987.56 (0.18% increase).</i></b>

Here is a new week after long Labor Day holiday. The U.S. Congress returns from summer break on Tuesday and has a lot on its agenda. Debt limit issues and the emergency hurricane will be first and foremost on the list.The devastation from Hurricane Harvey may have increased the U.S. fiscal agenda. President Trump is expected to decide on whether or not to eliminate Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, facing a today’s deadline from conservative states that have threatened to challenge DACA in court. The large US companies and Silicon Valley are making a last-minute effort to press the White House to save DACA program. Fedspeak will dominate the calendar, and after the disappointing August jobs report, the market will be focused on scheduled data for this week.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
US Dollar fell on Tuesday, the first trading day of the week, as tension between North Korea and the West weighted down greenback. North Korea successfully tested a hydrogen bomb on Sunday that can be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile. This was North Korea's sixth nuclear test since 2006 and it's most powerful to date. The tension between the U.S. and North Korea has been escalating more and more recently. Gold price increased on Tuesday because investors around the world increased their exposure to traditional safe-haven assets like gold. Among other precious metals: silver price rose today, platinum and palladium price also up.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2476.55 (+0.20%) and NASDAQ Index 6435.33 (+0.07%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21987.56 (+0.18%). </span>

The U.S. stock market was closed on Monday because of the Labor Day holiday, and all main indexes are trading higher today. Low trading volume, as investors returned from a holiday weekend, added uncertainty to the slightly changing tone on Wall Street. After North Korea sharply raised the stakes Sunday in its standoff with the rest of the world, detonating a powerful nuclear device that it claimed was a hydrogen bomb that could be attached to a missile capable of reaching the mainland United States, investors have been searching for a catalyst that will lead to a steep market correction.
The next four months will be busy ones for investors as markets are heading into the end of the year. For sure, it will be a busy four months for markets analytics and September has historically been one of the most volatile months for stocks.

<b>Economic data for this week: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factory orders </span><b>(Tuesday), </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markit services PMI, ISM nonmanufacturing Index </span><b>(Wednesday), </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekly jobless claims, Unit labor cost </span><b>(Thursday), </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wholesale inventories, Consumer credit </span><b>(Friday).</b>]]></content>

		<title>Gold Breaks 2016 High in Japan… US to Follow?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest news for the precious metals investors this week was not the gain in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> or <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, nor the continued weakness in the US dollar. </span><b>The most important news for precious metals investors was the price increase of gold in Japanese yen terms. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">After several years of tight correlation, these markets are in the process of changing behavior, yet this important shift is still being largely ignored by the mainstream press. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In early August (</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/07/are-gold-and-the-japanese-yen-equal-part-i/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part 1 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/14/are-gold-and-the-japanese-yen-equal-part-ii/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part 2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) we covered the historically tight correlation that has existed between the Japanese yen and gold prices dating back to 2011. If you did not have the opportunity to do so, please check out those posts for a better understanding of the analysis that follows.</span>
<h3><b>Gold in Yen Breakout </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a>, as priced in Japanese yen, broke above its 2016 high in sudden fashion, rising from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¥141,300 per ounce to ¥146,095, a gain of 3.3%. The technical action is highlighted below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2530" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/a_GoldJPY.png" alt="Break above 2016 high " width="540" height="354" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We made the case in the past linked articles that a key determinant for a more significant precious metals advance in US dollar terms would be when the strong correlation between the Japanese yen and gold prices begins to break down.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is the updated long-term ratio between yen and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold</a>, which shows that the two have essentially acted as the same asset class as a net sum since 2011:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2531" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/b_LT.png" alt="Japanese Yen to Gold ratio" width="1040" height="618" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To see the 2016 high for gold in yen exceeded this week tells us that the 6-year correlation is beginning to weaken. It is the breaking of this correlation which will eventually help gold to assume its proper role as safe-haven of last resort.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will look for a major advance at gold prices worldwide to correspond with a breaking of the lower (blue) trend line of the Japanese yen/gold ratio, which should begin with gold breaking above </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¥151,000 per ounce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or a 3.5% further gain as priced in yen from last week’s close. This could occur within the next 2-3 weeks.</span>
<h3><b>North Korea Fires Missile Over Japan… Tests Hydrogen Bomb</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We never like to attribute one single cause to a market reaction. After all, the market is the sum of millions of distinct individuals, each acting upon their own unique beliefs, strengths, and fears. </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2532" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/c_NKorea.png" alt="c_NKorea" width="602" height="550" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, it is likely that a portion of the movement into gold by Japanese investors this week was due to fears over North Korea. The latter is noted to have – for the first time ever – launched a ballistic missile directly over Japan, which then landed east off the coast in the Pacific Ocean. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">North Korea is subsequently reported to have tested a hydrogen bomb on Sunday.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tensions are certainly high between the United States, North Korea, and Japan, and while gold price spikes due to isolated geopolitical tensions are typically short-lived, those which foreshadow lengthy periods of conflict tend to be important early-warning indicators for more sustained price advances to develop throughout time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is too early to say with any certainty how the current standoff between these nuclear powers will end, but by breaking above 2016 highs on the chart, gold priced in Japanese yen is signaling something important for those who would listen: the correlation between the two safe-havens is breaking… in favor of gold.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is unlikely that the 6-year tight correlation will end in one week, but initial hints that this is in progress are plainly visible on the charts. We will continue to monitor this development at regular intervals for the foreseeable future. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All asset correlations eventually change. When gold begins to advance in yen terms it signifies that the precious metal is picking up on new fundamentals, and set to be the safe-haven of last resort. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the upcoming week, we watch to see if gold can match its similar 2016 high in US dollar terms, which comes in at $1,378.   </span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After reaching the strong point last week, the US Dollar Index started this week on a weaker note. The US Dollar Index is weak in the early hours on Wednesday. The geopolitical tensions and concerns about the Trump Administration keep adding more concerns to the US Dollar Index. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders have a chance this week to move the index in reaction to North Korea’s nuclear weapons test over the weekend.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">President Trump’s administration reached a surprise deal with Democrats this week to raise the short-term US debt ceiling, reducing concerns over a potential government shutdown.

		<title>Lessons from September 11 for Gold Prices</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a common warning given in the mainstream financial press that goes something like this: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do not buy gold during a geopolitical crisis because as soon as tensions fade the precious metal will give back all of its gains.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to look no further than recent articles available online to confirm this warning, such as this one published last week from CNBC:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2553" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/12-month-high-on-North-Korea-a_CNBC.png" alt="12 month high on North Korea a_CNBC" width="428" height="528" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the above warning accurate? Are the “experts” correct that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> should retrace if recent tensions with North Korea recede?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is: it depends on what timescale one is referring to. Yet by making a blanket statement and not quantifying the above warning with the proper perspective, this and similar articles risk misleading investors as a critical time period unfolds for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> over the next few years.  Let us examine a historical example.</span>
<h3><b>September 11</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Exactly 16 years ago today, let us rewind back to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to examine the price action in gold from a technical basis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">September 11 was a Tuesday, and on the day of the attacks, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins/gold-american-eagle/gold-eagles">gold</a> spiked in price from $273 per ounce to $290, a 6.2% gain. In today’s dollars, that would equate to an $84 intraday spike. The price action in the year leading up to the attack and in the months following is shown below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2554" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2-pic.-b_911.png" alt="2 pic. b_911" width="955" height="714" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that after the September 11 surge, gold topped out over the following three weeks just below $300 per ounce. Moreover, in the two months that followed and as fears of an Armageddon scenario faded, gold did indeed give back all of its gains. Specifically, on November 24, gold closed below $272, which was the opening price from the morning of 9/11.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many who bought gold in the days following the attacks were surely frustrated to be sitting on losses within a few months, and those who did not put this price action into proper context likely sold and moved on to other asset classes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But even though gold did give back all of its short-term gains, was selling and moving on wise in hindsight?</span>
<h3><b>Increased Technical Perspective</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us back out the above chart for increased perspective to examine some of the technical trends that were in play at the time. Below we show gold from 1997 – 2002. The same 9/11 geopolitical price spike is again highlighted:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2560" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/c_9702.png" alt="c_9702" width="1102" height="825" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, gold had seen significant multi-year downtrend breaks leading up to the 9/11 price spike, shown above by the red callouts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A double-bottom was observed in April 2001, matching within a few dollars the July 1999 price of $252 per ounce.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, gold was showing several classic technical patterns indicating that a trend change from the prior years of falling prices was in the process of unfolding. The September 11 terrorist-related spike, while it was given back over the course of the following two months, was itself actually part of a longer basing formation for the precious metals in the early 2000’s.</span>
<h3><b>Longer-Term Perspective</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">How did the “isolated” September 11 price spike look when viewed within the context of the bull market which unfolded over the next 10 years? The following chart speaks for itself, where the spike can barely be seen amidst the more significant bottom that served as a launching pad for the next decade. </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2557" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pic-4-Geopolitical-price-d_LT.png" alt="pic 4 Geopolitical price d_LT" width="1075" height="804" />
<h3><b>Back to the Present</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tensions between the United States and North Korea continue to pick up in intensity. The gold price has spiked nearly $100 over the last six weeks. If tensions fade, will gold give back all of its gains?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, would selling in such a scenario be the proper decision?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Examine the gold price action since 2011, below. Note the now-ongoing five-year cup base formation that is nearing its later stages, following an important break of the 2011 – 2017 downtrend. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Does this chart not bear striking resemblance to the 1997 – 2002 chart, above, which also featured similar downtrend breaks amidst a multi-year cup basing formation?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You be the judge.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2556" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pic-3-Cup-Base-e_current-1.png" alt="pic 3 Cup Base e_current" width="1125" height="842" />
<h3><b>Takeaway on Geopolitical Events and Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold may indeed see a short-term retracement if tensions fade between the United States and North Korea (<a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/09/05/gold-breaks-2016-high-in-japan-us-to-follow/">Read our previous article</a>). Gold could give back $100 per ounce just as quickly as it gained it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the historic store of wealth is now five years into a clear basing process, one that is playing out irrespective of any short-term geopolitical price spikes. Multi-year bases are important setups for future market trends. The lessons from the 1997 – 2002 timeframe, which includes the spike seen on September 11, should be important for investors to keep in mind as they navigate what should be a volatile final quarter to 2017. Geopolitical tensions come and go, but the unemotional language of the charts contains a message all its own.</span>

		<title>Ellis Island National Monument Coins Sold Out</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">On August 29, the US Mint issued its 2017</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-5-oz-silver-atb-new-jersey-ellis-island-statue-of-liberty"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellis Island National Monument 5-ounce silver bullion coins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Three days later, all 40,000 had been sold. No additional coins of this design will be produced. This is the fourth release of five in the</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/12/13/2017-stb-silver-quarter-designs/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">America the Beautiful Silver Coin Series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Still included in the inventory of the Philadelphia Mint is an undisclosed amount of 2016 Harpers Ferry National Park silver bullion coins. To date, 48,000 of these coins have been sold.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The next in the series will be released to authorized purchasers on November 13th. This coin, the 40th issue out of the 56 of the ATB Coin Series, commemorates the George Rogers National Historical Park. A nod to Indiana, this coin features one of the greatest victories of the American Revolution, led by Colonel George Rogers Clark.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorized purchasers both buy and sell bullion coins from the US Mint, in turn offering a two-way market. They are included in the approved buyers of American Eagle gold, silver, and platinum bullion coins, as well as American Buffalo gold bullion coins.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus far this year, sales of</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/12/13/2017-stb-silver-quarter-designs/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">3-inch 5 ounce silver bullion coins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been decreasing, with 35,000</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-5-oz-silver-atb-iowa-effigy-mounds-national-monument"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Effigy Mounds National Monument 5-ounce silver bullion coins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sold and only 20,000 of the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site and Ozark National Scenic Railway purchased.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales of the 2016 ATB releases numbered 105,000 for the Shawnee National Forest coin and 75,000 for the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park release. The sales of the releases made towards the end of the year were lower, at 40,000 for the Theodore Roosevelt National Park coin and 35,000 for the Fort Moultrie coin.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,325.50 (+0.09%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.78 (-0.16%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $987.30 (+0.24%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $934.65 (-0.26%), Dow Jones index 22,147.76 (0.05% decrease)</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index is trading higher today supported by the economic data released yesterday, </span>including a stronger-than-expected rise in consumer price inflation for August. Even recent economic data may have been inspiring, and hopes for Thursday’s inflation data still relevant, but some strategists suggest don’t wait for a Dollar recovery yet. Gold price dropped to its lowest level again as the dollar moved ahead. The stronger greenback makes<span style="font-weight: 400;"> dollar-denominated gold more expensive for holders of other currencies. Among other precious metals: silver price is lower, platinum price is slightly higher, palladium price also dropped.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2491.72 (-0.26%) and NASDAQ Index 6425.62 (-0.55%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22147.76 (-0.05%). </span>

Wall Street indexes are trading mostly lower today following the strong data on jobless claims and inflation. Meanwhile, the latest data makes the expectations for a Fed hike in December seriously questionable. Inflation is a key economic factor the US central bank considers when deciding monetary policy.

Oil prices rose on Thursday after the International Energy Agency announced escalating faster than expected oil demand recently.

On the US political front, Donald Trump and top Democrats appear to agree to give a legal status to the children of illegal migrants but also haven't confirmed this fact so far.

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekly jobless claim, Consumer Price Index, Core CPI.</span>

		<title>CFTC files $290 Million Lawsuit against Monex a Precious metals dealer</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">On September 6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2017, the <a href="http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr7609-17">US Commodity Futures Trading Commission</a> (CFTC) accused a Newport Beach precious metals investment firm, Monex, of defrauding thousands of US customers with over $290 million by pulling off an illegal scheme of high-pressure sales tactics, leaving many senior clients without their life savings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to buying precious metals, it’s essential to do business with a trustworthy, reputable bullion dealer whose mission is to offer best prices, products, and services. Unfortunately, not all dealers provide secure and legal services and this recent CFTC law enforcement case highlights what to avoid when making precious metal investments.</span>
<h3><b>CFTC Lawsuit Against Monex</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal regulator filed the civil lawsuit against California’s Monex in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on Wednesday, September 6. In its complaint announcement-golded the alleged fraud “one of the largest precious metals” cases, it has ever filed since it involves over 12,000 accounts and holders and a time frame from July 2011 until March 2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">CFTC claims that Monex, owned by Louis and Michael Carabini (father and son) deceptively pitched leveraged trading through its so-called</span><a href="https://www.girardgibbs.com/monex-atlas-lawsuit/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlas trading platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in which the company profited while customer losses were all but inevitable – the complaint cited several cases of elderly clients who lost over $100,000 each.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission’s complaint focuses on off-exchange leveraged trades of silver, gold, platinum, and palladium performed by Monex clients using money borrowed through its Atlas platform. Although the alleged purpose of this trading platform was to allow retail customers to make investments by using the borrowed money, CFTC claims that Monex made most of its revenue by controlling the prices at which its clients bought and sold precious metals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The price difference (spread) between the underlying price on tracked spot markets and the price which Monex set was about 3%, which means, according to the cases cited in the complaint, it would cost the company’s clients $2,550 to trade 5,000 oz. of silver compared to a $25 cost to enter into a similar futures contract on a regulated exchange. Based on customers’ examples, CFTC alleged Monex for charging “outsized price spreads, commissions, interest on loans, and administrative fees.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, to boost its sales, Monex also deployed forceful TV campaigns and telephone sales which promised that its Atlas trading program was a secure and safe method of protecting customers’ wealth against inflation. Its employees involved in campaigns and sales were specially trained and used scripts that emphasized the investment’s “profit potential and security” – e.g. “If gold were to increase in value by $100 per ounce in the next year, and you had a 30% to 40% net gain, you’d feel pretty good, wouldn’t you?”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, over 90% of all leveraged Atlas accounts and customers lost big and Monex is believed to have intentionally hidden this information from its prospects. Besides, the commission alleged that Monex’s sales agents were paid bonuses and commissions based on the number of accounts which they opened and their transaction volumes, not by client’s earnings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">CFTC also accused the company’s owners, Louis Carabini (father) and Michael Carabini (son) of committing fraudulent activity and operating an illegal leveraged commodity platform which hasn’t been registered with the commission. The federal regulator also asked a judge to stop Monex from continuing to offer its Atlas platform trades to clients, seeking to have full restitution to harmed customers as well as disgorge any ill-gotten gains.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side, Monex issued a statement through which it denied any fraud allegations and stated that the terms of its Atlas trading program were publicly disclosed. The company also declared that it will vigorously defend the commission’s unwarranted action, disputing whether the federal regulator had any jurisdiction over the firm.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this is not the first time the Carabinis or Monex have faced legal troubles. In 2004, Monex faced a class-action lawsuit that alleged the company in misleading its clients, resulting in a $150,000 payment to class members, while in 1974, Louis Carabini was accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of obtaining $1 billion through deceptive sales of silver coins on margin.</span>
<h3><b>Always Perform Due Diligence</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Seemingly, there may be other similar precious metals companies or telemarketing firms which offer deceptive services or make forceful sales through home shopping TV shows. In most cases, they manage to convince the customers, mostly elderly clients, to make apparently a highly profitable investment while, in reality, ripping them off.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A previous eloquent and similar example is CFTC’s 2015 civil enforcement action filed against Andrew Kurzbard and its telemarketing company Guardian Asset Group, LLC which accused them of engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious metals transactions. The lawsuit ended with a consent order in May 2017 through which the now-defunct company and its owner were forced to pay restitution of $434,413.54 and a $651,620.31 civil monetary penalty and imposed them permanent trading and registration bans. Guardian and Kurzbard agreed to pay the civil penalty without denying or admitting the allegations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, choosing a reliable precious metal dealer is not easy, but it’s a critical decision either you already are an expert investor or just a new one. Luckily, the above lawsuits teach us about </span><b>key signs that warn us about a potential illegal bullion business</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-pressure sales and aggressive TV campaigns</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metal trading based on in-house loans</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unclear and confusing shipping policies, terms and conditions etc.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expensive and ambiguous costs, fees, commissions etc.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unallocated precious metals storage</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partial ownership in form of “gold units” or “shares”</span></li>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
US Dollar Index is trading lower today following Thursday’s economic data and the North Korea's another missile over Japan. North Korea fired the sixth ballistic missile since 2006 and the second one over Japanese island on Friday morning. Market analytics consider we could see further weakness later today if investors decide to aggressively dump higher-risk assets. Gold price also slipped on Friday, also weighted down by the North Korea’s latest missile launch over Japan and the strong inflation data. However, geopolitical risks can boost demand for safe-haven assets such as gold and the Japanese yen. Among other precious metals: silver price slightly dropped, platinum price is also down, palladium price increased.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stock market on Friday opened mixed S&amp;P 500 2495.62 (-0.01%) and NASDAQ Index 6428.62 (-0.02%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22203.20 (+0.12%). </span>

Wall Street indexes are trading mixed on Friday as investors looked at the last North Korea’s firing of another missile over Japan and analyzed yesterday economic data.

The missile flew over Japan before landing 2,000 km east of Hokkaido. After the North's latest launch, South Korea has responded by firing its own missile into the sea. President  Donald Trump announced that its time for China and Russia to take direct actions against the North Korea.

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retail sales, Empire state index, Industrial production, Consumer sentiment. </span>]]></content>

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Silver Eagle is certainly one of the most eagerly awaited silver bullion coins of each year. A timeless addition to any portfolio, the astounding 1 troy ounce, .999 fine silver coin is the official silver legal tender of the country, carrying a denomination of $1 USD and a remarkable, classic design – the Walking Liberty on the obverse and the heraldic eagle on the reverse.

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Mint’s first-ever 5 oz. coin and also its largest silver bullion coin to date, the stunning America the Beautiful Quarter series will mark its 41</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> edition by introducing the 2018 5 oz Silver  ATB Michigan Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore Coin.

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned before, the notable Royal Canadian Mint also strikes the Silver Canadian Maple Leaf with one-of-a-kind privy marks. This special Zodiac privy marks series was introduced in 1998, and its huge popularity convinced the mint to release the second series in 2012. The 2018 edition will feature a privy mark of this year’s Chinese Calendar character - the wonderful “Year of the Dog” – an intricately detailed dog engraved right next to the maple leaf’s stem. Also offered in 25-coin rolls and 500-coin monster boxes, this delicate coin is a creative gift and an excellent addition for collectors who favor lunar bullion pieces or well-diversified precious metals portfolios.</span>

This year’s release features a German Shepherd dog and pup lying in the grass with Chinese peony flowers in the background, framed by the inscription “Year of the Dog”, the “P” mintmark and the Chinese character for “dog”.

Here is a new week ahead and it’s all about the two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which starts on Tuesday. The Fed will release a policy statement summary of economic projections and a press conference with Fed Chair Janet Yellen. Fed meeting has a lot of parts to discuss, but the main decision is about interest rates. Experts suggest that the Fed is not expected to change interest rates, but it is likely to announce that it will start letting the bonds held on its balance sheet. Other U.S. important economic data is mainly about the housing market, the leading economic indicators will be released on Thursday, and Flash PMI should be released on Friday.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>

		<title>The Fed is Caught</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Federal Reserve begins its once-per-six-weeks policy meeting on Tuesday, with a statement to be issued by Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Wednesday at 2 pm EST. Expect lower volatility across most markets on Tuesday and Wednesday prior to the announcement, with a spike in volatility immediately after 2 pm. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot know exactly what will be announced on Wednesday, but the charts are positioning themselves for an important low to form across the precious metals complex coming into the meeting. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The markets are pricing in a near-zero chance of an interest rate hike on Wednesday, with roughly a 50% chance for a hike at the last meeting of the year in December.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we show the current dot-plot for interest rate expectations by the 16 members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which gives a consensus estimate for what US short-term interest rates will average for each of the next two years and beyond.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2657" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Federal-reserve.png" alt="Federal reserve" width="521" height="405" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For 2018, the consensus average is 2.00% – 2.25%, which would necessitate four more quarter-point interest rate hikes from the current target of 1.00% - 1.25%. This is the general expectation of the FOMC, although it is always subject to change based on market conditions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there is expected to be no rate hike this Wednesday, the markets will be watching for a potentially more important source of information: language describing the Fed’s intentions to “normalize” its balance sheet going forward. That the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/06/19/fed-rate-hike-and-gold/">Fed is set to normalize its balance</a> sheet was first discussed at the policy meeting in June; however, we have received no tangible information as to how or when the Fed intends to engage in this normalization since.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a reminder, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> sold off strongly on the day that the Fed announced its balance sheet normalization intentions, at the June 14 meeting.</span>
<h3><b>“Normalization” – Say What?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Normalization is a euphemism used by central banks including the Fed: the term is used to describe the selling of bonds and other securities that the Fed has “purchased” since the credit crisis of 2007 – 2009.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall that these bonds – and </span><b>all assets the Fed ever buys – are purchased with freshly created electronic money. </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever the Fed mentions purchasing anything, it is universally talking about printing money and debasing the currency – in other words, creating inflation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is rarely mentioned in mainstream financial publications, as the reality of the situation would be too appalling to discuss in such a forthcoming manner.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, manipulating the prices of assets by purchasing them with newly-created money: this is the only tool that the Fed has ever had.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a reminder of the unprecedented nature of the Fed’s balance sheet, the following chart is reprinted courtesy the Wall Street Journal, which shows the Fed’s holdings from 2004 through the present:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2658" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Building-the-Fed-balance-sheet.png" alt="Building the Fed balance sheet" width="554" height="365" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important point to observe is this: </span><b>it took the Fed from its creation in 1913 through 2008 to accumulate (a.k.a. print) $1 trillion in assets, yet in just the last nine years alone it has printed over $3 trillion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as its balance sheet has grown from $1 trillion to over $4 trillion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second key to recall is that the bulk of the Fed’s purchases have gone toward US treasuries and US mortgages. Is it any wonder that long-term bond and mortgage rates are the lowest they have been since World War II?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fed has completely distorted the very fabric of the financial marketplace, and every piece of the system that sits on top of this distorted base stands to be affected if and when the Fed begins to normalize its balance sheet.</span>
<h3><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2660" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/c_interest.png" alt="c_interest" width="378" height="436" /><b>US Treasury – annual interest expense</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now consider that this near-record interest expense is accumulating when benchmark </span><b>10-year Treasury bonds are at their lowest rates</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in over two generations:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2661" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Long-term-govenrment-Bond-yeild.png" alt="Long term government Bond yield" width="1125" height="433" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, </span><b>the government is paying record high interest when rates are at their lowest in modern history.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Can we imagine if treasury rates simply doubled, back to longer-term averages near 5.0%? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such would mean that the US government’s interest expense would approach $1 trillion per year, assuming no further debt was added into the equation – and of course, new debt keeps being added to the pile each year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What if 10-year yields returned to 7.5%, as they averaged for nearly 25 years from 1970 – 1995?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We must remember, when the Fed states that it intends to normalize its balance sheet, it is saying that </span><b>it intends to sell its recently-purchased treasury bonds, and thus allow interest rates to rise</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Can the Fed realistically be expected to sell much of its balance sheet in the face of record US interest expense, and thus force the government to roll over its debt at higher and higher rates?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The practical answer is: no.</span>
<h3><b>Most Only Know Falling Rates</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us observe: anyone who has been investing in the western world since 1980 knows only falling interest rates as a macroeconomic backdrop. Assuming the average investor begins his or her career at age 22, this means that </span><b>anyone born after 1958 knows only that interest rates keep falling, year after year</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A reversal in 37-years of falling interest rates is what the Fed is proposing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe the Fed has backed itself into a corner, and it will have to renege on its normalization-speak. If it allows interest rates to rise significantly, the central bank will crush the funding mechanism of the US government. If it continues to suppress rates through newly-created money, it will begin to lose credibility as an independent and impartial body.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A loss of confidence in the very institution of central banking in the United States and likely spreading around the western world is the potential if the Fed is not careful.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such will not happen overnight, but the Fed is walking a tight line between its own credibility and the ability of the United States government to fund its operations.</span>
<h3><b>A Third Central Bank Failure?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us not forget: two central banks have already failed in the United States: the First Bank of the United States was dissolved in 1811, and the Second Bank of the United States did not receive a charter renewal in 1836.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Central banking was not present nor required in the United States during the great technological revolutions of the mid-1800’s through early 1900’s, including the implementation of the railroad, the light bulb, the telephone, radio, automobile, and air travel. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Could we be seeing the first warning signs that a third central bank has caught itself in an unsolvable situation and will follow a similar fate as the first two?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In an era of faltering faith in central-bank promises, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> stands to assume its historical function as the premier asset class of last resort – the only financial asset with no counterparty risk and which is nobody else’s liability. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The history books are not written, but the fundamental data points and the quandary the Fed faces are there in plain sight for all to see. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, we watch to observe how the Fed handles its intentions for normalizing its balance sheet at this Wednesday’s meeting, and through the remainder of this year.</span>

		<title>How to sell your diamond jewelry</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you need <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/sell-to-us/diamonds-nyc">to sell your diamond jewelry</a>-it is important to arm yourself with the necessary information before heading to your local jeweler or dealer. Doing the correct research can give you the confidence that you need to get a better price for your valuables.</span>
<h3><strong>Here are some tips to on how to sell your diamond jewelry:</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get a free appraisal from a good jeweler, a professional diamond buyer, or even a pawnbroker in order to give you some insight about what you have. Tell the appraiser the truth about your plans to sell,  so that they can provide you with the most realistic idea of the resale value. Getting free appraisals from two or three different stores will help you get a good idea of how valuable your diamond jewelry actually is.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approach this process without unrealistic expectations about your diamond jewelry. Keep in mind that dealers and jewelers are in this business to make a profit, and if they agree to purchase your jewelry then they, in turn, have to make a profit out of it.Having unrealistic expectations will only lead to disappointment.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Familiarize yourself with the relevant information needed to </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/sell-to-us">sell diamond jewelry</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The basic criteria that all dealers use to grade diamonds are the 4 Cs:</span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Color</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The value of a diamond is determined based on its color. The most valuable diamonds are those without color, as their reflective qualities are superior compared to colored diamonds.  The closer the diamond is towards the no color range, the higher its demand. The exceptions to this rule are pink and blue diamonds, which are far more valuable. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cut</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:   Little known fact: the shape of the diamond is different from the cut. Diamonds come in round, square, and oval shapes, among others.  The cut is the angle and the finish of the diamond, which determines the brilliance of the light reflecting abilities of the stone. Both shape and cut are very important for a valuable diamond. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Clarity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The stones will be measured for their flawlessness. There are two types of flaws a jeweler looks for in a diamond: imperfection and inclusion. Imperfections are scratches on the stone or if the stone is chipped. Inclusions would be an air bubble, other mineral content, or cracks within the diamond. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Carat</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This refers to the weight of the diamond. One carat is equal to 200 milligrams. Don’t confuse </span>karat<span style="font-weight: 400;"> with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">k</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arat. Carat is used to measure the weight of diamonds and other stones, whereas karat is used to measure the weight of precious metals like gold and silver.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best thing you can do is to obtain certification for your diamonds. One of the best certification institutes is the highly trusted GIA or Gemological Institute of America. They won’t be able to help you with a monetary estimate, but they can provide detailed information about the four Cs of your diamonds. With this certification on hand, you will be an educated seller, deterring sellers from quoting you a low price. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get your diamonds and jewelry cleaned professionally before you take them to a buyer.  Smudges and dirt can distract a potential buyer or make it difficult to determine the exact value.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Know your options for where to sell diamond jewelry<span style="font-weight: 400;">. You have many different options. You can take it to a dealer or a jeweler, or you can also sell it online on e-commerce sites such as eBay, or even opt for consignment shops. If you want fast cash, then a jeweler or a dealer is your best option. If you plan to </span>sell diamond jewelry<span style="font-weight: 400;"> online, there are greater risks and it may take time for you to learn how best to sell your products on the different platforms available. This choice is much simpler if you already have experience selling online. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Familiarize yourself with the second entity of your diamond jewelry, the metal that your diamond is bound in. You will need to know the type of metal, its weight, and its karat or purity before you sell it. You will also need to know if the piece is an antique, if it was created by a specific designer or brand, or if the design is particularly rare. If you know that your diamonds are high-quality diamonds devoid of any imperfections or inclusions then they are more valuable out of their settings, as it allows the potential buyer to examine the diamonds freely and you will get a better price. If your diamond has flaws or inclusions which the setting is hiding and the diamond looks better in the setting than it would otherwise,  leave them in place, which may fetch you a better bargain. </span></li>
</ul>

		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the decline seen in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/">gold</a> prices over the past three weeks, let us update our technical roadmap for the international store of wealth.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the week as a sum, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> closed lower by 2.1% or nearly $28 to finish at $1,291 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the long-term gold chart below, it is critical to note that the precious metal is now coming back into the zone (green shading) to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the broken long-term 2011 – 2017 downtrend (magenta line). Oftentimes, markets will break out of an important technical boundary, only to reverse and revisit that same price zone several weeks or months later. This is what is now occurring in gold.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2732" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Gold-2008-Present.png" alt="Gold 2008-Present" width="1034" height="727" />
<h3><b>Why do Retests Occur?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Retests occur as short-term traders take profits following an important breakout.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a successful scenario, we expect a return to the breakout point to be bought aggressively by second-chance investors – those who missed the initial move, and who now scoop up gold when the market returns to the same price zone.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, in this case, gold broke its declining long-term downtrend at $1,265 back in mid-August. Because the trendline was downward sloping, if gold were to retest the technical breakout today it could fall all the way back to $1,250 without violating the line from the upper side. It is important to know that retests of technical trendlines may indeed occur at lower prices than their original breakout points.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who only view the price in isolation will be missing an important point: a trend change higher is unfolding on the long-term chart.</span>
<h3><b>Short-Term Support Levels</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold</a> could fall back to $1,250 as part of its trendline retest, our highest probability scenario is that it will not fall that low. Instead, we expect a low to form in the $1,283 - $1,301 region, shown below by the green callout.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2733" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Trump-Reversal-Resistance.png" alt="Trump Reversal Resistance" width="1000" height="749" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This expected low is derived from a confluence of important support levels identified in this range. In technical analysis, whenever we see a confluence of support levels within a narrow band, it represents a high probability target scenario. The specific levels are:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,301 – the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the entire July through September rally (light silver line).</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,300 – important horizontal resistance (black dashed line), which held prices lower for most of 2017, and was then decisively broken during the last week of August. When a level which formerly acted as resistance is finally broken, it should then serve as support the next time prices return there, as second-chance buyers look to enter positions, having missed the initial advance.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,283 – the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the entire July through September rally (light silver line).</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, we have three technical support levels within an $18 price region between $1,283 - $1,301, and this represents a high-probability zone for gold to bottom on the present retracement.</span>
<h3><b>Next Up: 2016 Highs</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The actual high two weeks ago was $1,362, and this figure is close enough to the July 2016 peak at $1,378 that we can call this most recent attempt a functional test of the 2016 resistance zone. The retracement that we are now seeing is expected to be the final drop before the next advance brings gold to fresh highs above 2016 levels.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We watch for lows to develop in the $1,283 - $1,301 range as an ideal short-term technical retracement. We encourage investors to use any price points for spot gold in the $1,200’s as final opportunities for accumulation in these ranges. New highs above 2016 levels should be in store for gold by the end of 2017 if prices continue to hold above the now-broken long-term downtrend on any retest.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver</a> is lagging gold on a relative basis, and next week we will focus more in-depth on what to expect for gold’s cousin on the next move.</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - September, 26</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,302.50 (-0.20%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.05 (-0.76%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $943.30 (-0.26%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $916.55 (+0.52%), Dow Jones index 22,296.09 (0.24% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
The US Dollar Index is climbing on Tuesday ahead of several speeches from Fed officials. In general, US Dollar has made good progress in the recent two weeks. The greenback has gained points against the euro after the Germany’s election results this week. Experts consider the geopolitical situation and Fed new monetary policy, all together, should make an interesting time for the US Dollar. Gold price slipped lower on Tuesday as US Dollar is trading higher, but not too far as yellow metal dropped down last week. Among other precious metals: silver price slightly dropped, platinum price is also lower, palladium price increased.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2496.66 (-0.22%) and NASDAQ Index 6370.59 (-0.88%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22296.09 (0.24%). </span>

Wall Street Indexes are trading lower today after North Korea’s foreign minister remark about shooting down U.S. bombers even if they are not in North Korea’s airspace. Ri Yong-Ho said this in response to Donald Trump’s comments on Sunday about “the regime’s leaders won’t be around much longer”.

Despite the geopolitical news, investors are waiting for fresh readings on the housing market and consumer confidence, as well as speeches from Fed chief Janet Yellen and three other U.S. central bankers later this week.

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer Confidence Index, New Home Sales. </span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - September, 27</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,285.40 (-0.20%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.82 (-0.76%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $922.90 (-0.26%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $922.20 (+0.52%), Dow Jones index 22,284.32 (0.05% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar jumped on Wednesday as investors look ahead to President Donald Trump’s announcement on tax reforms, which is expected to include plans to significantly cut taxes for both corporations and individuals. Investors expect to hear a list of actions rather than another “wish list” from Administration. Meanwhile, gold price dropped lower on Wednesday, weighed down by the stronger greenback and upcoming tax plan by Donald Trump’s administration. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold lost what it gained on North Korea tension after recent Fed’s monetary policy changes and last Yellen’s comments. Among other precious metals: silver price is slightly down, platinum price decreased, palladium price increased.  </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened mixed S&amp;P 500 2496.84 (+0.01%) and NASDAQ Index 6380.16 (+0.15%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22284.32 (-0.05%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading mostly higher, as analysts said the market is slightly recovered after a four-session of trading lower.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">President Donald Trump’s tax reform, which should be unveiled today, may lower the corporate rate to 20 percent, the individual business rate to 25 percent, and cut the top individual income tax rate from 39.6 to 35 percent. Analysts consider that the worst scenario for markets: the current tax plan because any improvement would be a benefit for US markets. </span>

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durable Goods Orders, Pending Home Sales. </span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - September, 28</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,283.90 (-0.20%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.81 (-0.76%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $920.60 (-0.26%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $931.25 (+0.52%), Dow Jones index 22,357.32 (0.05% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
The Dollar Index continued to rise and jumped to its highest level over the month on Thursday, following by the new tax reform and the commentary from Federal Reserve speakers.Gold price fell today below $1290 level. Analysts consider this is a very negative move caused by the combination of the geopolitical factors and changes in internal US policy. Among other precious metals: silver price is slightly lower,  meanwhile palladium price increased significantly, and platinum price dropped to 9-week lows, trading lower than palladium first time in 16 years.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2505.50 (-0.07%) and NASDAQ Index 6436.47 (-0.26%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22357.32 (+0.07%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading lower today as excitement over a new tax reform was weighed down by the weak economic data. Jobless claims rose in the latest week, although this spike was explained by Irma and Harvey, two recent hurricanes that devastated Florida and Texas.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A few of Fed speakers’ announcements will keep investors’ attention later today, while the main market’s attention captured by questions on how the new U.S. President Donald Trump tax plan will be put in place. </span>

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekly jobless claim, Gross domestic products.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Increasing Palladium Prices: What’s Going On?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a surprising turn of events, over the past two days, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price">palladium</a> has increased in price to the point of surpassing its more popular brother metal, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price">platinum</a>. 2017 has seen a steady surge in the price of palladium, and this month has pushed it higher than the price of platinum for the first time since January of 2001.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few factors that could be attributed to this climb. Palladium’s biggest customer is the automobile industry, an industry that makes up 80% of its demand. Carmakers use palladium in the making of catalytic converters for gasoline-powered and hybrid-electric vehicles, while platinum is used for diesel-powered vehicles. As consumers move more towards environmentally friendly vehicles, these hybrid cars are rising in demand as diesel vehicles falter. The scandal last year in Europe, where carmakers were found to be falsifying the emissions tests for their diesel vehicles, has further contributed to the decreasing demand for diesel-powered automobiles.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This price parity could also be due to palladium’s largest producer, South Africa, whose currency (the rand) has seen a strong few years. As the rand strengthens, South Africa’s exports increase in price and this filters into a rising cost for this precious metal. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly enough, 2017 is the first year when the US Mint has ever issued <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-1-oz-palladium-american-eagle-coin">American Palladium Eagle</a>, and this fact may also affect the increasing price of palladium. Following the Act passed by Congress in 2010 to create this coin, a third-party study commissioned by the Treasury Secretary was conducted to determine the demand it could generate. One finding of this study was concern about the unpredictability of the palladium market at the time, as it was relatively new on the scene and could be slotted into the industrial metals trade as opposed to precious metals. Ultimately, the enthusiasm of numismatists kept its release on track. Coincidentally or not, the Palladium Eagle has been released this year as the newest edition of one of the most popular coin series in the world, the American Eagle series. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, platinum hit its lowest spot price in 16 years, with the price of one ounce of platinum buying .9901 ounces of palladium. Palladium was available on Wednesday for $919.50 an ounce, with platinum down to $917.49 an ounce. Thus far this year, palladium has increased 35% in price, with platinum at only a 2% increase at this point in 2017.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - September, 29</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,289.00 (+0.07%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.87 (-0.35%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $922.80 (-0.56%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $937.50 (+0.40%), Dow Jones index 22,381.20 (0.18% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar is trading higher on Friday and gaining more than 1.2 % against a basket of major currencies this week. Analysts examine the greenback has had a relatively strong September after long summer months of declines.Supported by a  sharp rise in interest rates and ideas of tax reform, the US Dollar is closing one of its best month of the year. Gold price held steady just above the previous session’s six-week low. This week Gold prices witnessed major volatility, at the beginning of the week the prices were up by almost 2 percent due to ongoing tension between North Korea and the USA, but last few days turned negative for yellow metal after Fed Chairman speech and new tax reform. Among other precious metals: silver price decreased, platinum price is also slightly lower, palladium price keep climbing up. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday is the last trading day of this month and of the quarter, which makes it an extra special day for the precious metals charting perspective.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2510.06 (+0.12%) and NASDAQ Index 6453.45 (+0.19%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22381.20 (+0.18%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street indexes are trading higher today, with investors finding few reasons to keep pushing indexes higher following gains that have lifted for both the month and the quarter. This week was marked by comments from Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen and the long-awaited announcements on tax reform from the Trump administration.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest economic data was also promising: personal income rose 0.2 % in August, while consumer spending was up 0.1 %.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no much news and expectations for today: Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker has scheduled speech today at 11 am, covering the economic outlook. </span>

<b>Economic data for today:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Personal income, Consumer  spending, Consumer sentiment</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,277.50 (-0.20%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.72 (-0.76%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $915.50 (-0.26%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $926.30 (-0.52%), Dow Jones index 22,470.66 (0.29% increase).</i></b>

This week has plenty economic data, but most strategists are focused on what’s happening at the Federal Reserve as well as U.S and global political risks than any single data point. Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks Wednesday. That’s also the day the Senate will release a budget plan. The week’s economic calendar includes reports on the manufacturing and services industry early in the week and the ends with the September non-farm employment report on Friday. The sharp moves for US stocks occurred because of a mass shooting in Las Vegas that is being described as one of the worst in U.S. history.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar is trading higher against the major currencies as Fed rate hike continues to build. Analysts suggest the Euro is underperforming at the start of a new week because the political risks in Europe have not gone away. Gold price slipped on Monday as the greenback rose and growing expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate hike also adds the pressure. The yellow metal has its biggest monthly decline so far and there is nothing really to boost the gold price now. Among other precious metals: silver price is slightly lower, platinum and palladium prices decreased.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2526.67 (+0.29%) and NASDAQ Index 6524.77 (+0.45%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22470.66 (+0.29%). </span>

Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today as investors wait to hear from President Donald Trump comments about the prospect of talks with North Korea and boosted by the latest news of shooting in Las Vegas. With less than an hour to go before the markets open all indexes just jumped.

On the data front, there will be manufacturing PMI figures for September and manufacturing data out, which both reports may affect the market as well as the employment report later this week.

<b>Economic data for this week: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markit manufacturing PMI, ISM manufacturing index </span><b>(Monday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Motor vehicle sales </span><b>(Tuesday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Markit services PMI, ISM nonmanufacturing Index </span><b>(Wednesday),</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Weekly Jobless claim, Trade deficit </span><b>(Thursday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Nonfarm payrolls, Unemployment rate, Average Hourly Earnings, Consumer Credit (</span><b>Friday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Silver Lagging Gold – Cause for Concern?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have not had a good look at <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> in several months, so let us take the opportunity this week to do so.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the stats: for the week ended Friday, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> fell by 1.8% or $0.31 cents, to close at $16.68 as of the final tick for the December futures contract on the New York COMEX. It was the third weekly loss for silver in a row, matching the streak for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>. Silver is down some 8.8% or $1.62 from the recent high of $18.30 in September.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What should we expect going forward? Let us turn to the charts:</span>
<h3><b>Silver Short-Term</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2793" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Flash-Crash-1.png" alt="" width="570" height="515" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If silver continues to falter over the short run, we see minor support near $16.30, at the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the advance starting with the July flash crash lows through the recent peak at $18.30. More important support begins at $16.10 (labeled Initial Support above in black), a level which has held prices higher on five occasions since May 2016. We expect this support zone will hold as <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> now retests its long-term downtrend.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As silver moves higher, significant resistance will still be seen in the region between $18.30 - $19.00, an area representing at least five pivot highs since October 2016. All things considered, we expect sellers to emerge in this region again. This is labeled Primary Resistance on the chart above.</span>
<h3><b>Silver Lagging Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver has been lagging gold since the 2016 peaks for both metals at $21.25 and $1,378, respectively. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In stating this, we are referring to the fact that as of September 2017, gold has come to within 1.2% of its 2016 high at $1,362, while silver has only come to within 14% of its relative 2016 high at $18.30.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, in September silver made a lower high at $18.30 than either of its previous 2017 peaks, both of which just touched $18.50. Meanwhile, gold clearly exceeded its 2017 previous high of $1,295 in September. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Referring back to last week’s article, we continue to expect that gold will exceed its 2016 high on the next rally, either late this year or early 2018. However, our model shows that silver will continue to lag, and not exceed 2016 highs at the same juncture as gold. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Should this lagging be a concern for silver investors?</span>
<h3><b>Silver Underperformance in Perspective</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A common fallacy in the precious metals world is that silver must “confirm” every move in gold, or else the advance in gold is suspect or doomed to failure. We are not sure where this idea originated from, but it is absolutely false when we study the relative performance of both metals at key junctures throughout history.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us consider an example from the past that shares similar technical “basing” characteristics to the current time period for both metals.</span>
<h3><b>2000 – 2004 in Gold and Silver</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver lagged gold notably during the 2000 – 2003 timeframe, as we can observe from the following chart:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2785" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gold-2000-2003.png" alt="Gold 2000-2003" width="537" height="472" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After lengthy bear markets were nearing their terminal stages at the turn of the millennium, notice how gold began to turn upward and finally eclipsed its February 2000 peak at $323 per ounce by December 2002. Meanwhile, silver lagged gold for all of its advance. For example, silver remained well below its related 2000 peak at $5.60 even in December 2002, only reaching $4.85.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Was this underperformance by silver a reason to discount gold’s advance? Or was silver’s lag effect actually an opportunity in disguise for investors who were following the broader market context?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us advance the chart above by one additional year:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2786" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Silver-2011-2017.png" alt="Silver 2011-2017" width="537" height="473" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite lagging for most of the 1999 – 2002 timeframe, silver began to play catch up to gold in early 2003. In fact, silver rose over 90% from the point where our first chart ended in February 2003 through the April 2004 high. During this time, gold advanced only 17%.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors should be aware: most of the “work” in silver investing comes during the waiting. Silver can lag gold for weeks, months, or even years. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when silver does finally begin to catch up, it often does so rapidly and with little warning. The payoff tends to be worth the wait, even if it is frustrating to those with short time horizons.</span>
<h3><b>Expectations for Silver</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite lagging gold recently and our expectation that it may lag for some months further, silver remains in a healthy basing pattern on the long-term chart. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver’s long-term base will eventually be seen to be all price action underneath the key $25/oz level. We expect silver will continue to trade from the mid-teens through the low twenties per ounce for the next 12-24 months, even as gold looks to start a more significant advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During this basing period, metal will be quietly transferred from weak hands to strong.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the basing process completes and silver breaks $25, an entirely new trajectory will begin. But this is likely still 2-3 years into the future.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2794" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Silver.png" alt="" width="566" height="510" />
<h3><b>Takeaway on Silver</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver will play catch up to gold when many least expect it. For now, let us not fall into the trap of assuming that silver underperformance means moves in both metals are suspect. History shows that gold leading silver indicates an early-stage of an emerging advance, not a doomed market.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,281.90 (+0.20%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.97 (+0.76%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $919.70 (+0.26%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $927.55 (+0.52%), Dow Jones index 22,773.67 (0.01% decrease).</i></b>

Here is a new week ahead, starting with Columbus Day, which means nothing is happening on Monday. The government shut downs for the day, bond markets are closed, only the  U.S. stock markets are open for trade on Monday. This week, the Fed releases the minutes of the September meeting, and it will give investors a better picture of how the central bank will execute its plan. For the rest of the week, there are some economic data, that could make some changes in market volatility. The biggest report comes on Friday when the government will release the Consumer Price Index.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar moved higher on Monday as traders consider the increased chances of one more interest rate hike in December and also increased optimism about tax reform plans. Gold price gained some points on Monday, as North Korea-USA tension got a new flare-up. Over the weekend President Trump said that White House has talked to North Korea many times without success and now it seems only one thing will work. This announcement left many Americans to think what would be his next step and is there any military actions behind this. Among other precious metals: silver price increased, platinum and palladium prices are also trading higher.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2549.33 (-0.11%) and NASDAQ Index 6590.18 (+0.07%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22470.66 (-0.01%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes opened mixed today, while bond markets are closed in observance of Columbus Day. Investors were analyzing comments sent by U.S. President  Trump over the weekend. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those comments triggered concern that the U.S.-North Korea standoff could be about to enter a new phase.</span>

<b>Economic data for this week: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">None scheduled </span><b>(Monday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Small Business Index </span><b>(Tuesday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Job openings, FOMC meeting </span><b>(Wednesday),</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Weekly Jobless claim, Producer Price Index </span><b>(Thursday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Consumer Price Index, Retail Sales, Consumer Sentiment (</span><b>Friday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Gold and a Falling Gold/Silver Ratio</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold has fallen further over the past week from the correction zone between $1,283 - $1,301 which would have constituted an ideal 38.2% - 50.0% Fibonacci retracement of the July through September advance. However, as discussed in the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/09/25/gold-is-testing-important-support/">gold update</a> two weeks ago, the precious metal could fall all the way back down to $1,240 at this juncture without violating the technical model. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The message of the market remains: <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is retesting the breakout from it's long-term 2011 – 2017 trendline, shown below in the magenta color. The retest zone is now highlighted in green for greater clarity on the intermediate-term chart:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2816" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/a_gold.png" alt="a_gold" width="1061" height="794" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the week as a sum, gold fell nearly $10 or 0.8%, to close at $1,275 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX for the December futures contract.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> bucked the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> trend and finished higher for the week by $0.11 cents or 0.7% to close at $16.79. This represents a falling in the gold to silver ratio (the number of ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold) over the short term.</span>
<h3><b>Lessons from a Falling Gold to Silver Ratio</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The notable action in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> versus gold last week warrants an updated look at this important ratio. (For the chart below, we must switch over to the trading desk because it allows us to view intraday price data, as opposed to COMEX-only price data, as with our usual provider.)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The important points to recall regarding the gold to silver ratio from 2011 through the present:</span>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2011 – 2016 rising channel in the ratio generally corresponded with falling precious metals prices, as gold held its value better on a relative basis. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major 2016 surges in both gold and silver occurred amidst the ratio breaking lower through the rising channel in April 2016, falling from 84 down to 64 ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold by July 2016.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since July 2016, as both metals have corrected in price, the gold to silver ratio has been in a general rising trend again.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the depth of silver’s Flash Crash in July, the ratio peaked at 85, just touching the lower broken boundary of the 2011 – 2016 channel. </span>This was a retest of the broken channel, labeled on the chart, and it represented a spike high – a level which was quickly rejected by the market.</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, the 2011 – 2016 rising channel was decisively broken during 2016’s metals surge. </span><b>This was an important signal of a long-term trend change, of which we are still in the early stages.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect the next major surge in both metals prices to occur when the gold to silver ratio breaks lower from its secondary rising trendline, which is shown on the chart above beginning in July 2016. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, this level would come in at 70 ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Precious Metals Prices This Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If indeed the low for the present retracement has been seen as of Friday with gold touching $1,260 and silver briefly dipping to $16.30, gold will have made a correction that falls still within the valid retest zone of it's long-term 2011 – 2017 downtrend.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The outperformance of silver on Friday is an early positive sign for the sector as a whole.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We continue to expect gold will eclipse its 2016 high of $1,378 on the next primary wave higher, while silver may lag on a relative basis with respect to the time required to break its own high of $21.25. Any such lag in silver should be looked at as an opportunity.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar Index is trading higher on Thursday, after the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's September policy meeting. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Fed officials expressed they would like more inflation data in the next few months when deciding on future rate hikes. Gold price rose to its highest level in the last two weeks today, after minutes from the US Fed. Gold is highly sensitive to rising interest rates, as these tend to boost the dollar. Among other precious metals: all major precious metals increased today.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2555.24 (+0.18%) and NASDAQ Index 6603.55 (+0.25%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22872.89 (+0.18%).</span>

Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today, as investors consider that another rate increase this year likely to be warranted. If traders are not worried too much about the Fed’s policy, there is also North Korea and geopolitical tension that support the prices.

Bitcoin hits a new record high above $5,200 today, with rising interest causing a rally for the price of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is now up around 424 percent year-to-date. Traders think that three major factors that have contributed to the recent price surge of Bitcoin: the hard fork in November, the introduction of the national licensing program for cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan, and the rise in demand for Bitcoin in the US market by institutional investors.

		<title>Bitcoin Hits All-Time High</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday saw an all-time high for bitcoin, setting a new record at $5316.86 at the time of writing. This year has seen regular growth for this form of cryptocurrency, with the previous all-time high hitting on September 2nd, at $5231.28. As of today, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/06/02/why-is-bitcoin-going-up/">bitcoin</a> has shown a 424% increase for 2017 to date and a 750% increase in the past year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin started the year at $966 and is now worth more than four times the price of an ounce of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a>. This record growth is attributed to the increase of interest shown by investors in cryptocurrency, whose total market cap has risen higher than $160 billion for the first time since early September.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">China’s banning of exchanges with cryptocurrency in September has caused caution for some, but most investors do not appear to be concerned. There have been new reports released this week stating that bitcoin trading in China may resume with stricter regulations. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Russia is also working on regulation of the use of cryptocurrency, with President Vladimir Putin warning of “serious risks”. He tempered his warning with a refusal to throw up “too many barriers”, which may have helped bitcoin reach its high today. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with the calls for regulation, cryptocurrency is gaining traction as a common currency, with even some property developers in London accepting rent payments from tenants through bitcoin. The Japanese government announced on September 29 that it was implementing regulations that would recognize bitcoin as an accepted payment method. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Differing predictions come from economists, with some warning of a price bubble. Harvard professor of economics and public policy Kenneth Rogoff stated that while he predicts that cryptocurrency and its technology will continue to grow, the bitcoin itself could collapse.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This high was not unexpected, as the growth of bitcoin has been at more than $4800 this week, but marks a major achievement.</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,292.20 (-0.20%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.20 (-0.76%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $932.70 (-0.26%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $979.00 (-0.52%), Dow Jones index 22,922.62 (0.22% increase).</i></b>

Here is a new week ahead, packed with a lot of economic readings in the US and key economic releases from across the globe. On the political stage - President Trump’s decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal will add to global concerns, along with the ongoing threats from North Korea. Global news: European leaders will meet this week to discuss Brexit. Meanwhile, Spain’s constitutional crisis is also not over yet.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
US Dollar is trading higher today, recovering after Friday lost as financial stability was weighted down by President Trump’s updated Iran policy. The last week unfolded some new views that the Federal Reserve will adopt a measured approach to its pace of monetary-policy normalization. Gold price significantly decreased today buoyed by worries over Iran and by rising dollar. Among other precious metals: all major metals prices dropped today.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2549.33 (+0.18%) and NASDAQ Index 6627.18 (+0.32%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22922.62 (+0.22%). </span>

Wall Street indexes rose to a three-year high today. Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Sunday reaffirmed the U.S. central bank's commitment to raising rates, even after the disappointing inflation data.

All the market focus is on Senior Trump administration officials comments that the United States was committed remaining part of the Iran nuclear accord for now.

		<title>Gold: Record-Breaking Volume as Base Nears Resolution</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have maintained a target of $1,485 - $1,535 per ounce for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> by the end of 2018 for several months now. This target is based on a measurement of three technical levels which all occur within this $50 swath. As a reminder for new readers of this column, the three target levels we are referring to are:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consolidation from December 2015 through August 2017 featured an amplitude of $330 per ounce, from the low of $1,045 to the high of $1,375. This consolidation took place in the form of a giant triangle on the charts. In technical analysis when a triangle-consolidation break, the target is derived from an equal measurement of the amplitude ($330), added onto the apex of the triangle ($1,205). This calculation gave a target of $1,535. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is clear horizontal resistance visible on the long-term <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> chart at $1,525 (black line). This level formerly acted as support on three occasions in 2011 – 2013 and then failed on the fourth attempt in early 2013. Generally, strong former support levels will subsequently act as intermediate-term resistance on the next attempt to overcome them, as those who previously purchased gold at these higher levels will choose to exit the market at break-even.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire 2011 – 2015 gold decline comes in at $1,485. Fibonacci levels are derived from a pattern which exists in many aspects of nature (such as seashells, hurricanes, and the spirals of the galaxies) called the Fibonacci sequence. Financial markets often follow these similar patterns, the markets being a component of (human) nature.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, when we have a strong confluence of resistance levels within a tight range, this represents a high probability zone for the next target. </span><b>For gold this comes between $1,485 - $1,535.</b>
<h3><b>Record-Breaking Volume a Clue</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, we see clear signs that gold is gaining strength over the short run. As discussed in past articles, gold has already broken it's long-term 2011 – 2017 downtrend. What more, trading volume is picking up, to the extent that Q3 2017 (just closed on September 30) featured </span><b>the highest quarterly volume of gold contracts traded of all time: </b>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2848" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gold-2011-Present.png" alt="Gold 2011-Present" width="566" height="423" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, we can see that this volume surge is occurring still as prices remain at or below 2013 levels. It is often said in a technical analysis that “volume precedes price movement”. These volume spikes are happening now, during the final period of what is still a 5-year basing process (overall flat prices since 2013). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What is shown in these volume spikes is an acceleration in the transfer of gold from weak hands to strong hands, as this base nears its terminal stages?</span>
<h3><b>The Nature of Gold’s Base</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The question surrounding gold’s target remains the timing – and for this we must evaluate the developing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shape</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the ongoing 5-year basing pattern:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2849" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gold-Quarterly-Price.png" alt="Gold Quarterly Price" width="559" height="331" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we can see from the chart, gold’s 5-year basing pattern continues to fit the profile of an early-stage parabolic growth curve, in colloquial terms resembling the “cup” profile (blue). </span><b>The lower range of the early parabolic curve has just been tested with gold’s low price of $1,262 from two Friday’s ago.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Note the blue-callout which points to this location of gold’s recent test of the parabolic curve.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If gold can maintain its early-stage parabolic base pattern (green arrows, above) throughout the remainder of 2017, it argues that our $1,485 - $1,535 target will be reached sooner rather than later, likely by Q2 2018. This may seem improbable for the casual observer of the metals markets, as we have not seen prices that high since early-2013, but it is indeed what is expected given an early-stage parabolic curve which remains unbroken. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If gold fails to maintain this parabolic base (red arrows, above), nothing changes about the target of $1,485 - $1,535. It is only the timing that will change – such will be pushed out toward the end of 2018, possibly to extend into Q1 2019. In sum, in this scenario, more consolidation will need to occur between the recent low of $1,262 and the 2016 peak ($1,378), before gold is ready to advance.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Record-breaking volume is being witnessed coming into the gold market. This is occurring amidst a period of five years in which prices have moved generally sideways as a net sum. The message here is of a market that is picking up interest and nearing the later stages of its basing process.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The remainder of the price action in 2017 will give us strong clues as to how soon our stated target zone will be reached. A continuation of an initial parabolic curve will bring a quicker target, while a breaking of this curve will result in a lengthier consolidation prior to the targets being reached.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us keep our eyes on gold carefully over the next three months.</span>

		<title>A Galaxy Far, Far Away- New Star Wars Stormtrooper Coin</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest of the unmatched <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/coins/world-silver-coins/oceania/new-zealand/niue-star-wars">Star Wars Bullion series</a> has just been announced. Released by the New Zealand Mint, these coins feature officially licensed images of popular characters from the Star Wars movie series. Star Wars is one of the top movie franchises of all time, setting its iconic storyline in “a galaxy far, far away.” The New Zealand Mint began this series of coins in 2011, beginning a line of incredible gold and silver coins, and has announced that its latest release will commemorate the Stormtrooper character. </span>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>A Galaxy Far, Far Away</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Created by George Lucas, this incredibly popular franchise kicked off with its first movie release in 1977. As of 2015, the approximate value of this series was at $42 billion, setting it as the second highest-grossing media franchise of all time. Indeed, it has played an iconic role in popular culture, having launched a boom of science fiction releases in the 1970s and 80s, and has been preserved in the US National Film Registry for its cultural significance. Phrases from this film are often used in colloquial language, specifically “may the Force be with you” which triggered an unofficial holiday, May 4th, as “Star Wars Day”. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stormtroopers are the police force for the Galactic Empire, the backbone of the Imperial Military and the forces that are sent out to stop the Rebel Alliance. Easily identified by their white armor worn over black body gloves, they carry blasters and laser rifles in the films.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Stormtrooper characters underwent a lot of development throughout the film series. In the films that were first released, they had non-identifying personalities, remaining staunchly loyal to the Empire and unremorsefully evil. As the series progressed, the audience learned that during the Clone Wars, they were simply military members who had not yet been absorbed by the Empire and had no real human component to their character, they were simply machines in a human form. In one of the Clone War films, they actually fought for the Jedi, but in a way that didn’t really place them on the good side, instead, they simply acted as a weapon that had been placed in the hands of the Jedi forces. In the more recent releases, we have been able to see a different side altogether of these mostly faceless characters underneath their bucket-shaped helmets, introducing us to Stormtrooper Finn, who actually defects from the Dark Side and leaves the Stormtrooper order behind to join the Rebel forces.</span>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>Available in Gold or Silver</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These coins are available in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2018-1-oz-niue-gold-star-wars-stormtrooper-coin">gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2018-1-oz-niue-silver-star-wars-stormtrooper-coin">silver</a> options. Both weighing in at one troy ounce and with a limited mintage of only 250,000 for silver and 25,000 for gold, these coins will be available for purchase in the beginning of November this year. With a $2 denomination for silver and $250 denomination for gold, these coins can be bought individually or in multiples.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2873" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/silver-and-gold.jpg" alt="silver and gold" width="805" height="450" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he reverse side of these coins showcases an officially licensed, close-up image of a Stormtrooper, armed with his blaster. The satin matt background carries the Imperial symbol and is engraved with the weight and quality of the coin, along with the official logo of the New Zealand Mint and the Lucasfilm copyright stamp. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The obverse carries the portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, designed by Ian Rank-Broadley, encircled by the inscriptions “Elizabeth II”, “Two Dollars”, “Niue”, and the year of mintage, 2018.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bullion Exchanges ensures a pleasant, and secure retail and online shopping experience. You can purchase the new </span>2018 1 oz Niue Star Wars Stormtrooper today <span style="font-weight: 400;">by phone at 800.852.6884 or online at our website. </span>]]></content>

		<title>Updated Spring 2018 Product Release Schedule from US Mint</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann Bailey, the Products Manager at United States Mint, presented the schedule for future product releases, which is now available on the US Mint’s official website. This presentation occurred during the United States Mint Forum in Washington D.C., with Bailey speaking as the Numismatic Program Manager. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The following is a compilation of the upcoming release dates that were included in this presentation:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At noon on January 4th the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2018-1-oz-silver-american-eagle-bu">2018 American Silver Eagle 1 oz coin</a> in Proof from West Point will be available for purchase. If you are a bulk purchaser, you have the opportunity to take part in the new bulk pack program that was begun last year. Through this option, you will receive five trays of 42 Eagles in a special box, available on the same day as its release. This bulk option was very successful last year, and the Mint has announced that this option could be made available for the Burnished Proof or San Francisco Silver Eagle in the future.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven days after this release, on January 11th, the Birth, Congratulations, and Happy Birthday Sets will come available. The Kennedy half dollar, Jefferson nickel, Roosevelt dime and Lincoln cent are included in the Birth and Happy Birthday sets in Proof version, bearing the S mint mark to denote the San Francisco mint. The Birth Set will also include the PIctured Rocks National Lakeshore quarter from Michigan, part of the America the Beautiful series, whose release will kick off the year for the series. The Happy Birthday set, contrastingly, will include the Rhode Island release which will conclude the series for 2018, the Block Island National Wildlife Refuge quarter from Rhode Island. A 2018-S Proof 1 oz Silver Eagle will come in the Congratulations Set. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The following Wednesday, on January 17, the first commemorative coin of 2018 will be released: the World War I Veterans Centennial Uncirculated Silver Dollar. This coin will be available in Proof and Uncirculated options. Five additional coin and medal sets will be available for purchase on the same day, each representing a branch of the US Military that served during World War I: the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Marines, and the Air Service Corps. The US Treasury stipulated that these medals could only be created to increase the sale of their coin counterparts, meaning that in order to purchase the entire set you will have to buy at least five World War I Veterans Centennial commemoratives. However, because the medals were struck with the same planchets and showcase exquisite designs, they will add value to any collection.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">January 23rd marks the release of the 2018 <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/coins/us-silver-coins/america-the-beautiful">America the Beautiful</a> Proof Set, which will include the San Francisco minted Proofs of 2018’s America the Beautiful quarter series: Michigan/Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, Wisconsin/Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, Minnesota/Voyageurs National Park, Georgia/Cumberland Island National Seashore, and the fifth and final release of the year, Rhode Island/Block Island National Wildlife Refuge.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">February will see the release of the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-w-1-oz-platinum-american-eagle-proof-coin-w-box-coa">American Platinum Eagle</a>, whose theme of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness stems from the Declaration of Independence. This three-coin series will break the mold of the previous 20 years’ worth of releases for its changing obverse designs that will share the same reverse eagle design. The 2018 release will showcase Lady Liberty on its obverse, her arms wrapped around a girl that is assumed to be her daughter. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On February 8th the one-tenth ounce American Liberty gold Proof Coin will be released, with the same design as the 2017 gold release of this coin. This fractional version is available by popular demand, due to the high price of gold affecting the sale of the 2017 release.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Thorpe, the renowned Olympic football player, was the first Native American to win a gold medal in the Olympics. His achievements will be celebrated in the 2018 Native American $1 coin, available in rolls and bags on February 15th, with the Pictured Rocks quarter three-coin set available for purchase five days later. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">February 22nd marks the release of the 2018 America the Beautiful 90% Silver Proof Set.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">March will kick off with the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2018-1-oz-gold-american-eagle-50-coin-bu">2018 American Gold Eagle</a> line, and one ounce, half-ounce, quarter-ounce, and tenth-ounce Proof coins will be sold beginning on the first. The American Gold Eagle four-coin set will additionally be released on the first. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Struck at the San Francisco Mint, the 2018 US Mint Proof Set will be released on the sixth of March. This set will include 2018’s five America the Beautiful Quarters in Proof, along with the Kennedy half-dollar, the Roosevelt dime, the Jefferson nickel, and the Lincoln cent, all of which are also in Proof versions. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The second commemorative release of 2018 will come out on March 15th, the 2018 Breast Cancer Awareness commemorative, which will include $5 22-karat pink gold coin, silver $1 coins, and clad half-dollars, available in Proof and Uncirculated, making a total of six coins in this set.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Five days later, on March 20th, 200-coin bags of the 2018 Kennedy half dollar and two-roll sets will be released. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2018 America the Beautiful Uncirculated Set will be released on March 29th, capping off the spring releases announced thus far.</span>
<h3><b>To Be Announced</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A tentative schedule is available on the website for the rest of the 2018 releases from the US Mint. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2018 American Buffalo one-ounce gold Proof coin will come out in spring, along with the Uncirculated 2018 Silver Eagle, Apostle Islands National Lakeshore rolls and bags, the three-coin set and five-ounce silver Uncirculated, and the 2018 US Mint Silver Proof and Uncirculated sets. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer will see the one-ounce Uncirculated Gold Eagle, a 2018 San Francisco minted Silver Eagle Proof coin, Cumberland Island quarter products, the 2018 50th Anniversary San Francisco Silver Reverse Proof Set, and the Voyageurs National Park releases. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the fall, we will see the 2018 American Palladium Eagle Proof Coin, the ATB Circulating Coin Set, Block Island quarter releases, the 2018 Limited Edition Silver Proof Set, and the Breast Cancer Awareness Coin and Stamp Set. </span>]]></content>

		<title>Changes at the Federal Reserve?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two important events are unfolding at the largest central bank in the world within the next two weeks:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/06/19/fed-rate-hike-and-gold/">The Fed gathers to set interest rate</a> and monetary policy at its once-per-six weeks meeting: on October 31 – November 1.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Trump is due to announce his candidate for the new Fed chair, and thus by default likely ousting current chairwoman Janet Yellen.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Rate Hike Odds</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the interest rate front, the futures market is pricing in overwhelming odds that there will be no hike at the coming meeting. The odds are 98.5% that the Fed maintains the current target rate, at 1.00% - 1.25%, as seen in the probability chart at right:  </span>

<img class="wp-image-2894 aligncenter" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/a_prob.png" alt="a_prob" width="452" height="294" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, our proprietary Fed-watch indicator, which relies on 3-month US Treasury yields as a leading signal for Fed interest rate hikes, is offering a slightly different perspective. [For context: 3-month yields have generally been rising 1-2 months before each Fed rate hike, as can be seen by the green highlights below.]</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note how although yields are still not back to their short-term July peak, they are indeed steadily rising again (blue callout):</span>

<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2895" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/b_3mo_gold.png" alt="b_3mo_gold" width="579" height="599" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If yields meet or exceed their July peak at 1.15 before December, we predict the Fed will indeed hike by another 0.25% at the December meeting.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The critical point on the above chart is to recall that each Fed rate hike since 2015 (itself the first in a decade) has witnessed a sequentially higher associated <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> price (black arrows, above). Thus, the expectation of another rate hike to come deserves our continued monitoring.</span>
<h3><b>Yellen Out?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chairwoman Yellen’s term is set to expire in February. Reports over the last week from unnamed Fed officials have hinted that Trump may choose to not renew Yellen’s term. The leading replacement candidate is Jerome Powell, who is currently a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2896" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/c_Fedchair-1.png" alt="c_Fedchair (1)" width="624" height="223" />
<h3><b>Yellen to be replaced by Powell?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If Trump indeed chooses to not renew Yellen’s position, it will mark the shortest tenure of a Fed chair since    G. William Miller was ousted by President Carter in 1979 after less than 18 months in office.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Steven Beckner, a Federal Reserve analyst, offered this summary on Miller’s short time in service at the Fed:</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under Arthur Burns, who chaired the Fed from 1970 to 1978, and under G. William Miller, who was chairman… to August 1979, the Fed provided the monetary fuel for an inflation that began as a flicker and grew into a fearsome blaze... If Nixon appointee Burns lit the fire, Miller poured gasoline on it during the administration of President Jimmy Carter. Without question, the most partisan and least respected chairman in the Fed's history, this former Textron executive worked in tandem with fellow Carter appointee, Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal, in pursuit of monetary policies that were expansionist domestically and devaluationist internationally. The goals were to spur employment and exports, with little thought to the dollar's value. By early 1980, inflation was running at 14 percent per year.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">May we then ask: why do reports suggest that Yellen will have the shortest term since Miller, who was responsible for the highest inflation rate in US history? What is occurring inside the central bank to cause Trump’s apparent distrust of Yellen? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A non-renewal after just one term in office is as close to firing a Fed chair as possible without the political embarrassment associated. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Something is not right within the US executive branch / Federal Reserve relationship. We suspect that recent analysis showing a long-term top being put into place in the US dollar is partly related to this instability within the central bank, which may be further expressed within the next two weeks in a Yellen departure announcement.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two central banks have previously been dissolved in the history of the United States. Stay tuned – the lasting success of this institution is not written in stone.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a new week ahead, with the big news for earnings, the economy, and taxes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, the government will release its first reading of third-quarter GDP, an accounting of all the goods and services the economy produces. The world will also see the monetary policy decisions from the eurozone and Brazilian central banks.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Dollar is trading higher in early trading Monday. The dollar index hit a two-week high overnight. The greenback started this week on the pretty positive way.

		<title>ScotiaMocatta Scandal Gaining Steam</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The world’s oldest <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> trader, ScotiaMocatta, which has roots dating back to the 17th century, went on sale on Wednesday, the decision stemming from a scandal that has shocked the global bullion market. Mocatta Bullion was purchased by Scotiabank in 1997 and has existed since 1671. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">News outlets have been following the massive money laundering charges that have come to light and will most certainly have a huge effect in some of the biggest players in the business. The Canada Bank of Nova Scotia has been testing the waters on finding a buyer for its <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> business- ScotiaMocatta. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This money laundering story, that a US refinery was part of a smuggling of gold from South America, has greatly affected many and has left the future of ScotiaMocatta very uncertain over the past few months. ScotiaBank may even have been searching for a buyer for close to a year and has been decreasing its business in case a sale doesn’t go through soon. JPMorgan has been put in charge of the sale of this mainstay in precious metals trading, and they seem to be eyeing China as a potential buyer at this time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">March sealed this sale, when Scotiabank made a loan to Elemental, a refinery in Texas, and set itself apart as one of their biggest lenders. When US prosecutors subsequently accused NTR Metals, a subsidiary of Elemental, of laundering billions of dollars of criminal gold, most of which came from Peru, Scotiabank’s fate was decided. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This story has garnered a lot of interest because of its slightly surreal aspects, like the fact that this Elemental subsidiary allegedly imported more than 3.6 billion dollars of gold from Latin America in the four year time period of 2012 to 2015. Two men involved, Samer Barrage and Juan Granda, pled guilty in September to money laundering plea deals. Following this, Elemental was booted from the London Bullion Market Association's “Good Delivery List” of gold refiners. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to come back from being removed from this list, as gold buyers tend to only buy gold from those that are part of it. Shortly after Elemental was removed, the Comex futures exchange in New York announced that it would no longer accept gold from Elemental for delivery against futures contracts. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This announcement along with the rising tide of scandal made it impossible for those with Elemental gold to sell their gold bars, leaving them stuck in banks, stated traders in the Financial Times. Buyers are also hesitant to take on any of this gold. Because of this, hundreds of millions of dollars in loans given to Elemental from ScotiaMocatta are left in limbo. Additionally, one of the five bullion banks that work in gold with the largest market, London, has been blackballed. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">HSBC and JPMorgan are prepared to step into Mocatta’s empty spot on the London market with their ability to provide credit to clients and refiners worldwide. They also provide an additional benefit that Scotiabank could not, which are their London vaults. The London gold market is estimated at approximately 5 trillion dollars a year, even though no exact number of how much gold is traded daily is available. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Scotiabank has the largest foreign presence of any Canadian bank and is currently looking towards the Pacific Alliance, a Latin American trade bloc made up of Mexico, Peru, Chile, and Colombia. For now, it will continue to look for a Chinese buyer for this compromised gold trading operation.</span>]]></content>

		<title>New Piece of Platinum Proof Series Announced by US Mint</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by the Declaration of Independence, a three-year program entitled “Preamble to the Declaration of Independence Platinum Proof Coin Series” was announced yesterday. This series will begin in 2018 and will feature one-ounce proof coins of 99.95% platinum with new, updated designs. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Proof coins go through a specialized minting process, where first burnished coin blanks are fitted into presses with special dies. The coin goes through multiple strikes which achieves a floating image effect over a mirrored field. Inspectors then scrutinize the quality of each coin before placing them in a protective plastic capsule and mounting them in a satin-lined velvet case. These coins will come along with an official Certificate of Authenticity and sell at a fixed price. The $100 face value of the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum/coins/american-platinum-eagle">American Eagle Platinum</a> Proof Coin sets it apart as the highest denomination of any US legal tender coin. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Mint has also made available uncirculated versions of the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins/gold-american-eagle/gold-eagles">gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/coins/us-silver-coins/american-silver-eagles">silver American Eagles</a> for collectors, which feature the same designs as the proof versions. Uncirculated coins can be distinguished by their mint marks which show where they were minted. They undergo minting in burnished coin blanks, which are fed one by one by hand into specifically adapted presses. These coins are also carefully inspected before they are put into a protective plastic and then within a box. A Certificate of Authenticity accompanies each of these coins.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-w-1-oz-platinum-american-eagle-proof-coin-w-box-coa">American Eagle One Ounce Platinum Proof Coin</a> was first released in 1997 and has always featured the same obverse, a Liberty portrait. The reverse has cycled through different themes, including “Vistas of Liberty”, “Foundations of Democracy”, “The Preamble to the Constitution”, and “Torches of Liberty”. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The third decade of this program will see updated obverse designs concurrently designed by the same person, Justin Kunz, along with a new shared reverse design. This series has been designed to reflect the foundation of American principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, as listed in the Preamble to the Declaration of Independence. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2018 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">release</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carries the Life theme and showcases Lady Liberty planting seeds in a field alongside a child. She carries a sword to symbolize the defense of life. The field around her symbolizes the labor and thought necessary to sustain life. The tree and stream in the background portray nature and the importance of being a good steward of the environment around us. The obverse of this coin is inscribed with “LIFE”, “IN GOD WE TRUST”, “E PLURIBUS UNUM”, “LIBERTY”, and the year of mintage.  </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2937" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Life-2018.jpg" alt="Life 2018" width="450" height="250" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2019 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">release</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> celebrates Liberty and features Lady Liberty standing tall over prairies, lakes, and mountains. The rough terrain in the background calls on the American spirit of exploration and the freedom to search for new places, ideas, and ways of life. Lady Liberty’s lips are parted, symbolizing freedom of speech, and the torch she carries acts as a guiding light. She also holds a book to show the need for law and equality. The obverse will be inscribed with “LIBERTY”, “IN GOD WE TRUST”, “E PLURIBUS UNUM”, and “2019”.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2938" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Liberty-2019.jpg" alt="Liberty 2019" width="450" height="250" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2020 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">release</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> commemorates the third and final American principle, the Pursuit of Happiness. This coin shows Lady Liberty at work harvesting a rich bounty with a girl at her side. Her bounty symbolizes that which liberty makes possible. The buildings standing behind her symbolize the American path, and the final step of the story shown throughout the series- from the furrowed field to mountains to home and farm. The representative of the hard work and ingenuity needed for success, this third coin wraps up the series. The obverse will carry the inscriptions “HAPPINESS”, “IN GOD WE TRUST”, “E PLURIBUS UNUM”, “LIBERTY”, and the year of mintage.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2939" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Happiness-2020.jpg" alt="Happiness 2020" width="450" height="250" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All will share a reverse design of an eagle soaring with an olive branch gripped in its talons, crafted by AIP Designer Patricia Lucas-Morris. They will all be composed of 99.95% platinum and will carry the “W” mintmark. </span>

		<title>Gold or Silver – Which One to Choose?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently I needed to sell some of my long-term precious metals holdings. The reason? To pay for some unforeseen business expenses.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the prospect of selling some physical metals first dawned on me, at first I felt resistance to the idea. How could I sell now, at current prices? What if prices rose after I sold? Would it be better to sell my <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"></a>or <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a>? Maybe I should take out a business loan instead?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These were all questions that arose soon after I began to contemplate the logistics of the transaction. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And they are important questions: after all, some of these precious metals I have been holding for well over a decade.   </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, I decided that I would indeed sell the metals as opposed to taking out a loan. While one could argue that with today’s low-interest rates, I might have been better off locking in a low-rate loan, it felt more sound for me to pay for the expense outright at this juncture. Perhaps the value of keeping life simple is worth more than a specific amount of dollars during certain time periods.</span>
<h3><b>Questions to Ask Oneself</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In completing the transaction, I began to review how many personal factors go into the decision to buy or sell precious metals. In this series of articles, we often focus on macroeconomic trends and price analysis, but there is an equally important number of personal factors that must go into each individual’s investment planning:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, let us consider the simple question of choosing whether to invest primarily in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> or in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> (or <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> or <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">palladium</a> for that matter). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What on the surface seems like it should be a simple question is often found to require a multi-faceted thought process. For example, one must consider:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Does one intend to hold the metals personally, or have them stored in a vault? </b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of holding the metals personally are that one does not have to pay for storage, and no third party ever has a record of the transaction, so privacy is maintained. However, the downsides are that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/how-to/where-to-hide-bullion-home">storage space</a> may be limited, and one’s living space may not be suitable for this. Concerns of theft may also exist. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And indeed, at the present gold to silver ratio of 75-1, the amount of personal space and/or fees required to store $10,000 worth of gold (approximately equivalent to eight 1-ounce coins) is extremely small compared to the space needed to store the same dollar amount of silver (560 1-ounce coins). These practical considerations are paramount for some.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>What are the individual’s risk tolerance and time horizon? </b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold is known to be more stable in value than silver – both when the metals are rising and when they are falling. For example, from the December 2015 low in both metals to the July 2016 highs, gold rose 32%, from $1,045 per ounce to $1,378. Meanwhile, silver rose 56% over the same timeframe, from $13.65 per ounce to $21.25. Clearly a nice outperformance by silver.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, let us consider another time period: 2011 – 2015. From gold’s peak in 2011 at $1,923 to its low over four years later at $1,045, the metal lost 45% of its value. Meanwhile, silver, which peaked at $49 in 2011, lost an incredible 72% in falling down to $13.65.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The point is: in choosing between gold and silver, an individual’s own time horizon and risk tolerance must be weighed. In a rising metals-price backdrop, silver tends to lag gold initially, and then play catch up on a greater percentage basis later in time. It may, therefore, be more appropriate for long-term investors with a higher risk tolerance. However, when the metals fall, gold tends to hold its value more so than silver. Gold provides a buffer to the extreme volatility of silver’s fluctuations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These two broad topics – storage and risk tolerance – are just two of the important issues an investor must ask himself when engaging in physical precious metals transactions. Of course, there are other considerations as well: premiums paid above spot price, taxes, and the ability to easily travel and/or barter with the metals are all factors that may or may not be important for an individual.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, there is never anyone right or wrong answer – the questions lie with the individual. No single plan of action will serve all investors. A realistic examination of one’s own goals and tolerances for risk must be considered:</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Know thyself.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">-Ancient Greek proverb, Temple of Apollo at Delphi</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2954" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/a_Delphi.png" alt="" width="706" height="469" />
<h3><b>Which Did I Choose?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So in the end, which did I end up selling to pay for the business expenses: gold or silver?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not what I prior thought I might have sold in such a situation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While I do have a long-term time horizon, and my risk tolerance is high, I actually choose to sell some silver to raise my funds.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? I’m planning a move in the near future, and the thought of discreetly carrying a few <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold coins</a> with me to my new home was more appealing than transporting a box with hundreds of ounces of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/bars">silver</a> to a new neighborhood.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, this might not have been the right choice for everyone – nor myself even in a different circumstance – but for the present moment, it was right for me.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the end, I felt a sense of gratitude to have had the capital – crystalized in precious metals form – available for when I needed it. Ultimately, I have seen that the disciplined accumulation of capital is one of the most powerful benefits of regularly investing in precious metals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Which do you choose as your precious metal of choice – gold or silver – and why?</span>

		<title>Bitcoin Hits $6,500 High for the first time ever.</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday saw an all-time high for bitcoin, setting a new record at $6500.00 at the time of writing. Bitcoin has been continually posting record highs of late, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/10/12/bitcoin-hits-time-high/">breaking through $5,300 level</a>, but Wednesday's rise appears to be a new record, based on the price of bitcoin across the US, Japan, South Korea, and Europe.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders suggest this jump was caused by news that the exchange operator CME Group was planning to introduce bitcoin futures.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This year the price rise has been driven by increasing mainstream adoption and awareness of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally. At least 55 cryptocurrency hedge funds have sprung up this year, many of them focusing on bitcoin.  Bitcoin has been rising by over 500% against the dollar this year. However, traders suggest that the main factors affecting Bitcoin surrounding the possibility of the Chinese government, resuming cryptocurrency trading after the reelection of President Xi Jinping later this year, and the strong performance of the Japanese market have contributed to the price surge of bitcoin over the past weeks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin traders are also speculating that this week's bull run is partly helped by a new coming "<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/01/bitcoin-forked-creating-new-bitcoin-cash/">fork</a>" in bitcoin's underlying software.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Differing predictions come from economists, but now may be a good time to report that bitcoin has had a great year. Sure, there have been some ups and downs, but bitcoin has been the clear winner. Furthermore, there have been increasing uses of bitcoin as legal tender around the world, and this trend would lead to hundreds of billions of dollars being allocated into bitcoin in the upcoming years and will allow bitcoin to achieve new highs.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,277.70 (-0.19%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.25 (+0.13%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $937.10 (-0.20%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $1005.00 (+1.90%), Dow Jones index 23,435.01 (0.25% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
The US Dollar Index is moving back today, followed the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold rates steady and some analysts report that President Donald Trump will appoint Jerome Powell as the next central bank chief. Gold prices increased on Thursday, supported by a weaker dollar as investors waited for the nomination of a new Fed chair and the results of U.S. tax reform legislation later today. Silver price is trading higher, platinum price slightly decreased, palladium price is also up.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2579.36 (+0.16%) and NASDAQ Index 6716.53 (-0.17%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 23435.01 (+0.25%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting this week (began Tuesday morning ended Wednesday afternoon) saw a very little reaction from the markets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A final Fed decision on Wednesday to leave interest rates unchanged didn’t cause any market collapse. Investor focus is now on the President Trump choice of the next Fed chair. It is expected that Governor Jerome Powell will replace Janet Yellen as leader of the central bank. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin breaks through $7,000 barrier on Thursday and is now more than 5x the price of gold. </span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - November, 6</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,272.50 (+0.20%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.96 (+0.76%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $923.10 (-0.26%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $997.85 (-0.52%), Dow Jones index 23,540.88 (0.01% increase).</i></b>

Here is a new week ahead, with features reading on inflation from China, retail sales from Europe and consumer sentiment from U.S., as well as speeches by Fed officials. Investors will get a few more clues about the direction of the economy. President Trump has an international trip through the Asia-Pacific region to drum up economic development. The tour begins in Japan, where Trump will meet with Emperor Akihito. Then President heads off to South Korea, China, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Hawaii. Now markets know who will be the next Fed chair and where the central bank stands on the economy.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar was trading higher today, supported by the weaker euro. Gold price increased today after upbeat US economic data and further interest rate hike announced by the Federal Reserve. Among other precious metals: silver price also slightly increased, palladium and platinum prices decreased today. </span><b> </b>
<h3><strong>Stock Market Today</strong></h3>
U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2588.17 (+0.03%) and NASDAQ Index 6778.49 (+0.22%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 23540.88 (+0.01%).
<p style="text-align: left;">Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today, with adding positive earnings reports to tech stocks and the new tax-reform plan, which cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, will send an important message to U.S. stock markets.
In the week ahead, investors will hear from a few top Fed officials and get some idea of what may come ahead in U.S. economy. This week's Fedspeak calendar will feature the first public remarks from the newest member.
Bitcoin price target lately raised to $7,500 during the early market sessions, and market analytics suggest the price will not stop here in the nearest future.</p>

		<title>Central Bank Shake-Ups Around the World</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although we are primarily focused here on <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> as priced in US dollars – as this remains the standard by which international traders and mining companies mark their assets – we remain cognizant that a worldwide movement of capital into precious metals is what will account for the bull market that we believe is just in the beginning stages of developing. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus we look elsewhere around the globe periodically. This past week the Bank of England under Governor Mark Carney raised interest rates by 0.25% to a new mark of 0.50%. While the fact that this was the first interest rate hike in the UK in 10 years is getting most of the mainstream attention, what is not being highlighted is that interest rates still remain at the lowest levels </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ever recorded</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the British monetary system. Below we show the Bank of England prime rate from the abolishment of the Bretton Woods <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> standard in 1971 (when currencies were allowed to float freely versus the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/31/us-dollar-approaching-critical-support/">US dollar</a>) through the present:</span>

[caption id="attachment_2979" align="aligncenter" width="737"]<img class="wp-image-2979 size-full" title="Interest rates rise to 0.5%" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/a_UK_int.png" alt="" width="737" height="530" /> Interest rates rise to 0.5%[/caption]

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We must also note: not only have interest rates been held lower from 2007 through present than any time in modern history, but they have also remained lower than the rate the Bank of England set during World War II (2.0%). Can we truly fathom that </span><b>England’s banking authorities deemed the nation’s economy to be in worse condition over the past 10 years than during the deadliest conflict in all of human history?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the unprecedented nature of the time we live in.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those new to central banking should know that the controlling organization does not simply have a lever to pull to lower interest rates at will. No – central banks must continually print money to buy short-term bonds in order to keep interest rates suppressed below the level at which the market would naturally set. This is a principal reason why low-interest rates are inflationary: money is continually being created each month as the central banks hold rates down.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be no surprise then that M3 money supply in the UK – the broadest measure of the total quantity of British pounds in existence – has nearly doubled since 2007, and indeed, is up over 5-fold since 1992:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2980" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/b_UKMS.png" alt="UK Money supply" width="892" height="412" />
<h3><b>Trump Nominates Powell</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile on the other side of the Atlantic, President Trump this past week has finalized his nomination for new <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/10/23/changes-at-the-federal-reserve/">Federal Reserve chair</a>: Jerome Powell. In recent weeks we covered how – if Powell is indeed confirmed – current chairwoman Yellen will have been “terminated” after the shortest tenure as Fed chair since G. William Miller presided over the highest inflation rate (14%) in US history in the late 1970’s.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2981" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/c_Powell.png" alt="c_Powell" width="426" height="300" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What more, Powell was originally selected as a Fed governor under the Obama administration, thus showing us that when it comes to central banking, the Democrat /Republican divide exists in name only: </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Janet Yellen “should be ashamed of herself” for creating “a false stock market” [by keeping interest rates low].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">-Donald Trump, September 2016.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do like the low-interest rate policy… I have a lot of respect” [for Yellen].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">-Donald Trump, July 2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line in central banking is: support primarily exists for Fed member banks at all costs. Everything else – consumer price inflation, unemployment, the value of the currency – comes secondarily.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most major markets were little changed on Thursday / Friday on the news that Yellen will be replaced by Powell – indicating that the status quo of sufficient money-printing to maintain the solvency of member banks will remain in place even when the new chair takes office in February 2018.</span>
<h3><b>Gold Price Update</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/bars/">Gold</a> remains in the midst of its long-term downtrend retest zone. For the week, the historic store of wealth finished lower by a fraction, down 0.2% or $3 to finish at $1,269 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon. As precious metals investors, we must primarily focus on the main gold chart at all times, and nothing about the technical action over the past week has changed the fact that a 6-year downtrend (magenta line) is now in the process of retesting its breakout point. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins/">Gold</a> is attempting to establish a new trend. We must let this retesting process play out:</span>

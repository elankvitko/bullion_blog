		<title>Scuba Divers Discover Priceless Treasure Trove</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

Time is a story keeper , leaving memories and objects as a path for us to revisit. A group of <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Gold.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-28 alignright" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Gold-300x197.jpg" alt="Gold" width="300" height="197" /></a>
unsuspecting scuba divers allowed their curiosities to lead them to the largest cache of gold to be discovered on the seafloor of the Mediterranean Harbor of Caesarea, with most being in nearly mint condition.

The group of scuba divers unwittingly noticed the brilliance of what appeared to be a toy coin on the seabed and it was only after further exploring that they quickly realized what they had stumbled upon. The divers excavated the coins and immediately turned them over to the Marine Archaeology Unit of the Israeli Antiques Authority, who have since planned to further unearth the area. The amateur divers displayed great respect for the archaeological find, and have since been deemed model citizens with hearts of gold. This is the largest discovery of gold in Israel, with 2,000 coins uncovered of various denominations with the oldest being a quarter dinar minted in Palermo, Sicily.

There are many theories as to the origin of these coins, and how they seemed to surface after over 1,000 years. Kobi Sharvit, director of Marine Archaeology Unit of the antiques authority theorizes <strong><i>“</i><i>There is probably a shipwreck there of an official treasury boat which was on its way to the central government in Egypt with taxes that had been collected”</i></strong>.  The coins likely surfaced due to storms and natural erosion, luckily this record breaking discovery was not swept to sea. Skilled numismatist Robert Cole had the pleasure of examining the coins and proclaims<strong><i> “</i><i>The coins are in an excellent state of preservation, and despite the fact they were at the bottom of the sea for about a thousand years, they did not require any cleaning or conservation intervention from the metallurgical laboratory.” </i></strong>The coins are said to be priceless in both their numerical and historical value.

Bullion Buddies, what would you do if you unwittingly discovered a gleaming treasure trove of GOLD?

		<title>3 Most Frequently Asked Questions About Precious Metals</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/123.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-50 alignright" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/123-300x225.jpg" alt="123" width="300" height="225" /></a>The United States has been making money since 1972, the first form of money being coins! These early coins were composed of precious metals and had actual value which led many individuals to begin collecting them. But does that mean everyone should just suddenly
jump into gold and silver? No, it does not. Precious metals are not for everyone. Just like any other investing, it is absolutely crucial that you obtain substantial knowledge of the products, as well as, the highlights and pitfalls prior to beginning a collection. So, let's get you started!

<strong>The 3 Most Frequently Asked Questions About Precious Metals:</strong>

<strong>What is U.S. 90 % silver coin and why is it highly recommended? </strong>

90% silver coins include quarters, dimes, and half-dollars minted before 1965. A face value dollar is how 90% silver coins are sold, meaning despite its composition 4 quarters for example minted before 1965 would equal $1 face value. A face value dollar is either 10 dimes, four quarters, or two half-dollars. A face value dollar contains .715 ounces of silver. 90% silver coins are highly recommended simply because it is often the cheapest, most divisible, most widely recognized and traded form or silver.

<strong>What is a round?</strong>

Silver rounds are composed of one troy ounce of .999 fine silver, the 99.9% pure silver coins are produced by various private refineries and are not just round "blanks" of silver. Silver rounds are made with varying designs, at times depicting highly trade-able coins. Regardless of the picture on their front and back, silver rounds do not have monetary value.

<strong>What is a Key Date Coin ? </strong>

In coin collecting, a key date refers to a date (or date and mint mark combination) of a given coin series or set that is harder to obtain than other dates in the series. This is because low mintage coins were frequently kept by collectors and saw little or no circulation, while common dates were rarely saved and typically became heavily worn. The next level of difficult to obtain coins in a series are often referred to as semi-key dates or simply semi-keys. Often times key date coins will be certified by top grading companies, including but not limited to NGC &amp; PCGS.

<strong>Bullion Fun Facts:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Several women have appeared on U.S. coins. The very first woman was actually not an American, she was a Spanish Queens. Featured on a commemorative coin, Queens Isabella of Spain was the first lady to be case on a W.S. coin in 1893.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>1964 was the last year the United States Minted quarters with 90% silver.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>In 1964 you could purchase a gallon of gas for 25 cents, today that same silver quarter is worth about $3.00!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>A 1964 silver quarter will still buy you a gallon of gas for your car! But, a 1965 quarter well that will only get you a shiny GUMBALL!</li>
</ul>
<em><strong>We have some pre 1964 quarters, do you?</strong></em>]]></content>

		<title>The Story of Philadelphia Coin Dealer Israel Switt</title>
		<content><![CDATA[Augustus Saint-Gauden is revered as one the most influential artists of his time, he was one the  first chosen in 1904 for membership to the American Academy of Arts and Letters,  and was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1896.

Saint-Gauden referred to his early relief portraits as "medallions" and took a great interest in the art of the coin.  Chosen by President Roosevelt to redesign the coinage at the beginning of the 20th century, he designed the double eagle coin which features a flying eagle on the reverse side and Augustus Saint-Gaudens' depiction of Lady Liberty on the obverse side. It was adapted for minting several times, but is still considered one of the most beautiful American coins ever issued.

Although 445,500 specimens of the Saint-Gaudens double eagle were minted in 1933, none were ever officially circulated because President Franklin Roosevelt decided to abandon the gold standard.  All of the coins were melted down, with the exception of 10 which disappeared from the Philadelphia Mint.

The family of Philadelphia coin dealer Israel Switt was granted the rights to 10 rare gold coins after a long battle which commenced when Switt's daughter gave the coins to the Philadelphia Mint to be inspected only to have the coins seized by the government.  In response to the seizure the Switt family filed a lawsuit against the government in 2011, claiming that it had previously split the proceeds with another owner in 2002 setting a precedent. They lost the lawsuit, however the U.S. appeals court overturned the verdict on Friday, April 17, 2015.

The U.S. Department of Treasury argued that the eagles were stolen from the U.S. Mint , and made claims that Switt was investigated in the 1930's , however their claims were quickly  invalidated with opposing attorney claiming he may have traded scrap gold for them. Since the verdict overturn they have not released any comments.

The family attorney Barry Berke said: “Congress clearly intended for there to be limits on the government's ability to seek forfeiture of citizens' property, and today's ruling reaffirms that those limits are real and won't be excused when the government violates them".

Keep your coins, the story they tell may make history some day!

		<title>Where To Store Your Bullion</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

The term portfolio refers to any collection of financial assets such as bullion. <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/vault.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-108 alignright" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/vault-300x237.jpg" alt="vault" width="300" height="237" /></a>Portfolios may be held by individual investors and/or managed by financial professionals, hedge funds, banks and other financial institutions. In terms of storing your Bullion properly there are three options which will ensure the protection of your collection/investment. Each presents different advantages and disadvantages, which is why it is imperative to consider each option and decide which if not all will be beneficial to your needs.

<strong>Common Practices in Storing Your Bullion Properly</strong>

<strong><u>At Home </u></strong>

Storing your bullion at your home ensures constant accessibility and control over your valuables, however it is crucial to keep your bars and coins in secure fireproof area in the event of a fire or natural disaster. It is also wise to store your Bullion in a location that is not accessible to others, which will provide additional security against theft. If you choose to store your Bullion at your home, consider increasing your insurance. This option not only allows you to dictate where and how your bullion is stored, it also eliminates the fees and policies of third party providers.

<strong><u>In a Safe Deposit Box</u></strong>

This method for storing your Bullion certainly ensures security, and is an affordable option. The disadvantage is that your access is limited to the financial institutions hours of operation, and there are fees which are subject to change.  Prior to choosing this option, you must confirm the insurance policy provided for your bullion in the event of natural disaster or fire.

<strong><u>In a Depository</u></strong>

Another option for storing your Bullion is a depository, it is the most secure option. Depositories will fully ensure your Bullion, in addition to offering services in the event you need access to your valuables outside of their business hours. Though this option can be costly, if chosen it is vital to store your valuables separate and not in a pool to further protect your Bullion against unexpected closures and natural disasters.

There are alternatives, however avoid non-secure locations such as self-storage facilities. Safeguard the value of your wealth by securing your valuables in a dry, cool, fireproof, and most importantly discrete location.

The 2015 1 oz. Canadian Maple <strong>E=mc2</strong> Privy Reverse Proof Silver Coin featuring a brand new design, with a unique reverse proof finish which is rare in coins produced by the Royal Canadian Mint is composed of 1 troy ounce of  .9999 fine silver and bares a $5 denomination.

		<title>Graded vs Ungraded , Which Do You Prefer?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/graded-vs-undgraded-00000005.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-172" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/graded-vs-undgraded-00000005.jpg" alt="graded vs undgraded (00000005)" width="850" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you own a coin that you genuinely believe is of substantial value, then it is worth taking
the time and money to have it certified, especially if you are interested in selling it in the future and want to realise its full potential.</p>
In the past, coin grading was a vague process and coins were categorized as good, fine, or uncirculated. As time went on, it became evident that a clearly defined and internationally accepted grading system needed to be established.

Coin grading has evolved over the years to a system of finer grade distinctions. Today, a coin is graded and given its market value based on its appearance and overall condition, there are five critical components that help determine this.
<ol>
 	<li>The Surface Preservation: This refers to the number of marks and scratches on the surface and the severity of these, in addition to the overall condition of the coin.</li>
 	<li>Strike: This is the process of imprinting a design onto a blank coin, more specifically the strength of the imprint.</li>
 	<li>Coloration: This can be described as a gage in how much the coin has changed from its original color. Discoloration may be due to age, improper cleaning, storage, or handling of the coin.</li>
 	<li>Luster: This refers to the appearance of a coin’s surface. It can be described as either satiny, proof like, or frosty. When you grade the luster of a coin, you basically grade the intensity, beauty, and integrity of the coin’s ability to reflect light, within the luster characteristics of that issue.</li>
 	<li>Eye appeal: This incorporates all of the above elements</li>
</ol>
Rarity is a significant factor in coin grading and in determining a coins value, there are several scales which have been developed for the definition of the rarity of a particular coin with the most common being “Sheldon Rarity Scale” and the “Universal Rarity Scale”.

When a coin is graded it is given a numerical value between 1 and 70. A PO-1 represents a barely identifiable coin and a MS/PR-70 represents a perfect coin with a full strike and no markings (these are incredibly rare). PO stands for basal (poor) state and MS stands for mint state. Between these opposite grades, in ascending order you get:
<ul>
 	<li>Fair (Fair): This is where you can identify the type of coin, although it might be bent or have holes.</li>
 	<li>Almost Good (AG): The design is outlined, parts of the legend are worn and smooth and the date is difficult to make out</li>
 	<li>Good (G): These are coins which are quite worn but have a distinguishable date. Design, legends and date are clear, but not sharp.</li>
 	<li>Very Good (VG): A coin showing extensive wear but for which the date and most lettering are still legible and devices are visible. (Devices can be defined as a design that is found on any coin. It is usually the bust of an individual who is a country symbol at a specific point in history. It might also be a country’s insignia.)</li>
 	<li>Fine (F): Moderate to heavy wear, entire design, legend and date are clear and bold, but it might still lack details</li>
 	<li>Very Fine (VF): Light to medium wear, the coins are slightly worn on the edges but sharp in details and an almost mint luster still evident.</li>
 	<li>Extremely Fine (XF or EF): used to describe coins which have been slightly circulated with light wear only on the highest points.</li>
 	<li>Almost Uncirculated (AU) Very small trace of wear only on the highest points. Very hard to tell the different between an AU and an Unc. Coins.</li>
</ul>
A grading finalizer assigns the final grade of the coin and thereafter the coin is sonically sealed in a protective, inert plastic holder known as a “slab”. This third-party appraisal of a coin’s physical condition, back by a guarantee, and a national network of reputable coin dealers provided an extremely reliable form of protection for rare coin consumers who could then participate in the coin market with greater confidence.

It’s imperative that you choose a reputable coin grading service to evaluate your coins and presently the NGC (Numismatic Guaranty Corporation) and PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service) form the top tier of a three tier grading service. They are the two most reliable and consistent services and use a consensus method of grading.  A <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/how-to/ngc-pcgs-graded-coins">NGC or PCGS coin grading</a> and approval have a higher demand in the market.

Although ungraded coins are undoubtedly cheaper and do not take on expenses beyond its cost, they are a hugely risky investment and as is pointed out, the true value of a coin lies in having it graded correctly, by an established and knowledgeable coin grading service.]]></content>

		<title>China To Adopt Gold Standard</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/download.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-166" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/download-300x296.png" alt="download" width="300" height="296" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The gold standard arose from a widespread acceptance of gold as currency thousands of years ago, and in less than a weeks’ time China will receive approval from its Central Bank to back the Yuan in Gold. Ken Hoffman of Bloomberg Intelligence says this would be a “game changer”, and does not believe the change will be the catalyst to severe constraint for the Chinese Central Bank. He explains in further detail that their decision to move toward the gold standard will help attract foreign capital. Historically moving toward the gold standard enabled the United States to become an International Monetary Fund after World War II. The U.S. held most of the world’s gold, and therefore many countries simply pegged the value of their currency to the dollar, thus making the dollar the defacto world currency. Hoffman states that if they receive approval China’s decision to adopt the Gold Standard will cause the rest of the world to view the metal as currency again.</p>]]></content>

		<title>Greece Closes All Financial Institutions, Creating a Gold Rush!</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

Greece has closed Banks, and stopped selling gold coins to the public after enforcing capital control. On June 27, 2015, the Greek government announced a shutdown of all
<a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/euro-373008_640.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-181 alignright" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/euro-373008_640-300x239.jpg" alt="euro-373008_640" width="300" height="239" /></a>banks in the country for at least ten days, stating they would re-open on July 6<sup>th</sup>. Gold rose on Monday amid the crisis but has since eased down.

Once re-opened withdrawals would be limited to 60 euros a day for each account with exemptions made for pension payments. The Athens stock exchange was also to be closed for a week, leaving both the people and investors in a state of unrest with a strong desire to move away from the euro.

This drastic decision has left investors searching for refuge, with the common view being that this was triggered by the turmoil of the Great recession. The demand for gold has risen fundamentally with gold futures climbing steadily.

GoldCore Ltd. has reported three times the average sales since the closing of banks and financial institutions in Greece. Bullion Vault a highly reputable internet peer-to-peer gold and silver bullion exchange with headquarters in the United Kingdom reported a jump in sales which is an indication of more extensive increments. Director of Frankfurt-based CoinInvest.com, states “When people learned that Greek banks will be closed, they started to think that it may not be a bad idea to have some money in gold.”

European nations are acting quickly, thus far for 2015 21.786 million ounces of silver American Eagles have been sold, 266,000 ounces of gold American Eagles have been purchased, while 95,000 gold American Buffalos have been purchased.

The impact is evident, but yields the opportunity for long term investments.

		<title>Platinum under $1,000/oz for first time since February 2009</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

Platinum fell underneath the $1,000 an ounce check on Friday, leaving costs in triple-figure region surprisingly since February 2009, as financial specialists kept on losing confidence in its principal interest viewpoint.

Vulnerability over the precious metals even with a rising dollar — set for its greatest week by week pick up in two months — is likewise weighing on costs, with gold hitting eight-month lows and palladium at its most minimal since late 2012.

Spot platinum fell to a low of $998.50/oz, down 0.7% at 10:41am GMT.

<a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/palladium-maple-platinum-eagle-coins.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-206 alignright" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/palladium-maple-platinum-eagle-coins-300x214.jpg" alt="palladium-maple-platinum-eagle-coins" width="300" height="214" /></a>Yield from South African platinum makers has been rising this year subsequent to disabling strike activity in 2014. Top player Anglo American Platinum reported a 60% ascent in refined equal generation in the second quarter.

Chinese jewelry utilization has been soft this year, while evidences of a stoppage in the worldwide auto industry, which utilizes the metal as a part of exhaust systems, is likewise undermining feeling towards platinum, examiners said.

"A major problem is that investors have lost faith in the long-term story and the reason is probably the diesel issue," Macquarie associate director Matthew Turner said.”

Information proposes general request in number-one customer China has additionally been soft this year. Mitsubishi examiner Jonathan Steward said platinum turnover on the Shanghai Gold Trade was down 21% in the first half.

"With jewelry buying suffering as a result of the equity market crash and economic slowdown, there is possibly more speculative activity than normal, helped by a rotation out of equities and into hard assets," he said in an interview with the Reuters Global Gold Forum this week.

"Overall, we are somewhat negative on jewelry fabrication demand this year, and cautious on industrial buying."

Platinum has not been underneath $1,000 since mid-2009, after the breakdown of Lehman Brothers and begin of the worldwide budgetary emergency started wide based offering of hard resources and frenzy over the standpoint for mechanical metals request.

This year it has been undermined by the way that last year's uncommon five-month strike among platinum excavators in SA — the wellspring of seventy five percent of worldwide platinum supply — neglected to lift costs, recommending shoppers were abundantly supplied.

Platinum's generally abnormal markdown to gold has come to its most astounding subsequent to late 2012, at almost $145/oz.

That has driven investors to venture over from the business. Gross short positions in NYMEX platinum positions sat at 93% of the record high a week ago, UBS said in a note, while platinum-supported trade exchanged trusts (ETFs) have seen surges this week.

Platinum ETFs, which issue securities sponsored by physical metal, saw enormous inflows

		<title>Gold ricochets back above $1,100/oz from five-year low</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gold.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-234 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gold.jpg" alt="gold" width="640" height="360" /></a>Gold rebounded and is above $1,100 an ounce as of last Thursday from the past session’s
five year low, as a retreat in the dollar incited financial specialists to exploit the value drop to buy back into the market.

Numerous investors remained distrustful towards the precious metal, be that as it may, after its most profound one-day misfortune in about two years last Monday, pushing costs through the chart levels and setting it up for further shortcoming.

Gold has been undermined for this present year by assumptions that the U.S. Federal
Reserve is on track to raise premium rates without precedent for about 10 years, boosting the expense of holding non-yielding bullion and lifting the dollar.

AvaTrade’s chief markey analyst, Naeem Aslam states:

<em>"Gold is falling out of favour as the Fed is preparing to increase borrowing costs,"</em>

<em>"This will remain the major hurdle for any upside move for the precious metal and traders will likely be selling into these rallies.</em>

<em>"The bounce in gold is nothing but a technical trade, as most major momentum indicators are showing that the recent sell-off is overdone."</em>

Gold’s recession last Monday was exacerbated by huge exchanging volumes on the Shanghai Gold Trade after speculators dumped more than $500,000,000 of bullion in seconds amidst early Asian trading hours.

Specialized examiners, who think about past value examples to gage the future heading of the trading, say the following focus for gold underneath last Wednesdays low close to $1,087/oz is $1,044, its 2010 low.

Possessions in the greatest gold-backed exchange traded fund, SPDR Gold Shares, shrank for a fifth day last Wednesday to their most minimal since 2008.

Some interest developed for physical metal, on the other hand a retreat in the dollar, which fell 0.5% against a currency basket, supported some purchasing in China overnight, merchants said.

MKS states:

<em>“The on-shore premium in Shanghai continued to trade in positive territory, sitting around $1.50 for the majority of the day, supporting an initial test of $1,100.” </em>

The gold debacle last week has prodded a purchasing spree of bullion coin in the United States, as government information demonstrated deals during the current month have hit their most elevated in over two years.]]></content>

		<title>Gold barely changed ahead of Fed declaration</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gold-stones.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-237 alignright" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gold-stones-300x200.jpg" alt="gold-stones" width="300" height="200" /></a>Gold floated close to its weakest level following mid 2010 on Tuesday, reflecting spectacular delay to offer up bullion in the midst of the developing desire of a close term climb in U.S. interest rates.

The Federal Reserve starts a two-day meeting later in the day where policy makers are liable to flag that a rate trek later in the year is sure as the U.S. economy fortifies.

A further descend in Chinese equities after their most profound defeat subsequent to 2007
on Monday has scarcely influenced trading in gold, normally seen as refuge metal.

ANZ Bank commodity strategist Victor Thianpiriya stated in Singapore, “If anything it’s a little bit surprising that we haven’t had the safe-haven bid in gold even though you’ve had these big risk-off moves in the Chinese equity market”.

Spot gold was flat at $1,094.40/oz by 2:50am GMT.

Bullion tumbled to as low as 41,077 on Friday, it’s least expensive since February 2010, extending its losing rushed to a fifth week.

The prior defeat in Chinese stock in July in addition to the Greek debt crisis neglected to start any place of refuge offer for gold, with financial specialists to a great extent concentrated on an approaching U.S. rate climb. That has reinforced the dollar and diminished the request of non-interest bearing resources, for example, bullion.

Financial specialist trust in gold stayed flimsy after last week’s slide joined by enormous trading volumes in New York and Shanghai. The metal lost more than 3% last week, the most since Spring.

HSBC, which has sliced its gold value conjectures during the current year and next, said the valuable metal was liable to stay underweight in the fleeting and "could move to within striking distance of $1,000/oz before recovering".

The enormous driver for most cost misfortunes for gold is an approaching U.S. rate increment and analysts are anticipating more affirmation from the Fed towards that end when the current week’s policy meetings are set to conclude on Wednesday.

“We’re still expecting a fourth-quarter lift off in the Fed funds rate and that’s when you’ll see the trough in gold or we could potentially see gold take another leg lower” said Mr.Thianpiriya, pegging the following significant back at $1,045 if $1,080 is broken once more.

U.S. gold for August delivery slipped 0.2% to $1,094.10/oz.

Likewise weighing on the assessment, China’s net gold imports from primary channel Hong Kong tumbled to a 10-month low in June, reflecting feeble interest from the major devouring nation.

		<title>Gold stabilizes as investors look for signals on U.S. rate trek timing</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gold-21.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-242" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gold-21.jpg" alt="gold-21" width="800" height="305" /></a>

Gold steadied on Wednesday as the dollar mollified, yet was still trading near an almost
five-and-a-half-year low hit a week ago as analysts and investors anticipated the result of a Federal Reserve meeting for signs on the timing of the first U.S. rate ascend in about 10 years.

Policymakers are prone to assert that only steady indications of a  solid U.S. economy and labor market would put them on track to bring interest rates up in advancing months, analysts said.

For non-interest yielding gold, higher interest rates mean costs could feel obligated.

Robin Bhar, Societe Generale analyst says “We bounced from the low but we are little changed and waiting for the Fed’s statement tonight and the second-quarter gross domestic product tomorrow”.

“These are two events that should set direction for the next few weeks although the market is expecting no change in the Fed’s language.”

The metal reached $1,077 a week ago, it’s weakest since February 2010, after a sell-off on trades in New York and Shanghai, when analysts and investors cut their vulnerability on apprehensions of further value decays.

In the wake of breaking the $1,100 bolster level, gold has found it difficult to recoup and keep afloat showing bearish financial specialists kept on hovering in the market.

The dollar declined yesterday and was at 0.2% against a basket dominant currencies ahead of the policy statement due this evening.

Commerzbank states “If a rate hike in September were to be signaled, this would doubtless drive up the U.S. dollar, which would ultimately weigh on the gold price, for the Fed Fund Features have so far only priced in roughly 40% of a rate hike in September”.

European equities progressed, impelled by additions in the U.S. and Asian markets on trusts that Beijing could stem the defeat in its markets without harm to the world’s second greatest economy.

Worldwide gold interest shrank to its most minimal since 2009 in the second quarter as China emptied trusts into its now pained equities market, as per a report by GFMS, a division of Thomson Reuters.

Possessions of the biggest gold-backed exchange-traded-fund, New York’s SPDR Gold Trust, were unaltered at 21.87 million ounces on Monday, the least since September 2008, after a seven-day slide.

Spot platinum increased 0.6% to $622.75/oz and platinum advanced 0.1% to $982.50/oz, both not a long way above multi-year lows while silver remained unaltered.]]></content>

Lower-evaluated government bonds additionally saw some minor selling.

That offset strong economic information. Eurozone processing plant action became quicker than beforehand suspected in July.

The Netherlands, Spain, and Italy all reported sound development — Italy’s extension was its best in over four years.

Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey complier Markit says “Policymakers will be reassured by the robust growth rates seen in these countries and the resilience of the manufacturing sector as a whole”.

“Especially as growth is likely to pick up again now that Greece has jumped its latest hurdle in the ongoing debt crisis.”

Energetic results from HSBC, Commerzbank, and Heineken likewise helped balance Greece’s inconveniences.

Pickups in Frankfurt and Paris made up for a 0.2% plunge by London’s FTSE.

<strong>Extraordinary fall of China </strong>

China’s poor information kept Asian markets from demonstrating the same flexibility.

MSCI’s broadest record of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell more than 1% to take it near to right on time July’s least level of the year.

Shanghai shares shed 1.9%, Japan’s Nikkei slid 0.3% and South Korea Kospi dropped 1%. Australian stocks dropped 0.4%.

Barclays strategists wrote in an everyday note to customers, “We believe the macroenviroment remains challenging for emerging market assets amid headwinds of low commodity prices, concerns over China and a looming US Federal Reserve tightening cycle”.

New flows data affirmed that pattern. Net remote offering from developing Asia has come to about $10 billion in the course of recent months. Just India has seen lesser inflows.

Recent streams information affirmed that pattern. Net remote offering from developing Asia has come to about $10bn in the course of recent months. Just India has seen minor inflows.

Among the fundamental worldwide currencies, the dollar held relentless in the wake of sliding on Friday on disillusioning US wage development information, at ¥124.14 and $1.0970 to the euro.

Late US financial information has undermined the dollar, yet the more extensive pattern has been to the upside, after the US Federal Reserve invited a rate increment in September during last week’s negotiations.

The US dollar has increased 7.75% so far this year against the world's primary trading currencies, following a 12% ascent a year ago.

As indicated by examination from the BlackRock Investment Institute “the dollar’s recent rally may just be getting started,”

		<title>Goldman Sachs and HSBC Buy 7.1 Tons of Physical Gold</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/10-countries-hoarding-enormous-stockpiles-of-gold.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-270 alignright" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/10-countries-hoarding-enormous-stockpiles-of-gold-300x225.jpg" alt="10-countries-hoarding-enormous-stockpiles-of-gold" width="300" height="225" /></a>On August 6, 2015, Goldman Sachs and HSBC took conveyance of an entirety of 7.1 tons of physical gold. The gold bars were not acquired for bank customers. They were bought for the banks themselves, labelled by the exchange as for shipment to the banks “house” accounts at COMEX.

Goldman Sachs, alone, took 3.2 tons worth of physical gold bars. Yet, even as the firm forms its stockpile, Goldman advises customers not to do so. As per Goldman’s Jeffrey Currie, the long haul viewpoint for gold is disheartening.  According to Currie, <em>“In longer term, we definitely like playing this market on the short side. We think we are in a structural bear market, not only in gold, but across the commodity complex, as the individual commodity stories are reinforcing to one another, creating a negative feedback loop.” </em>

Despite the shenanigans in the paper-gold market, we know the physical business is ablaze. Interest will surpass known supplies by no less than 1,350 tons in 2015. More in 2016. In any case, that won’t prevent somebody from setting up the paper market keeping
in mind the end foal to purchase from the physical market efficiently. This is on the grounds that the baffling gold “supplier last resort” will fill COMEX physical conveyance request, for the minute at any rate, regardless of how high it rises, and regardless of how low different supplies may be.

As indicated by HSBC strategists, there has been a:

<em>“drift towards Fed tightening and the associated USD strength, low global inflationary pressure, weak gold demand from India and China and market positioning and momentum.” </em>

This announcement was made a couple of days before we all found out about the 61% expansion in gold imports to India in the period, April to May. It is impossible that one the greatest players in imports with India did not know this. HSBC officials were positively cunning enough to approve the gigantic buy of physical gold for the bank.

In both cases, the buys are enlisted as being for the advantage of the bank, therefore both investors and collectors alike should follow the lead of the banks in purchasing gold.]]></content>

		<title>Gold set for its most sizable climb since January as stocks, and the dollar slide</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

Gold stabilized on Friday having hit its most elevated point in over six weeks and was setting out toward its greatest week subsequent to mid-January as further economic data from China has left financial markets shaken.

World stocks plummeted towards their most noticeably bad week of the year, while the dollar index hit its least in almost eight weeks after a Chinese production lines information added to questions about the Federal Reserve raising interest rates one month from now.

<a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/20140221-gold.png"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-275 alignright" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/20140221-gold-300x150.png" alt="20140221-gold" width="300" height="150" /></a>Gold had officially bounced back this week from July’s five-and-a-half-year low, supported by minted of the Federal Reserve’s last strategy meeting, which gouged desired for a fast approaching ascent in US rates.

Little change has been seen in spot gold since Thursday, while US gold futures for December delivery were $1.90 at $1,531.30.

Naeem Aslam, the Chief market analyst at Ava Trade says “The massive move we have experienced during the past couple of days … was primarily on the back of dollar softness and qualms around emerging markets.”

“The Chinese economic date release today has also helped the metal, as this presages more headwinds for the Fed.”

“However, now we do need a new catalyst to drive the price any higher and next week’s economic date could certainly fulfill this craving.”

Gold has gone under overwhelming pressure this year from possibility that the Fed would raise rates without precedent for about 10 years, lifting the open door expense of holding non-yielding bullion while boosting the dollar.

Wall Street plunged at the open, tumbling for the fourth straight session, as the information from China unnerved investors already stressed over the pace of worldwide development.

The voracity for danger was further scratched in Europe after Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras stepped down from his position on Thursday.

Gold may very well stay bolstered in the transient by further short-covering and safe-haven demands.

		<title><![CDATA[The Royal Canadian Mint's latest security enhancements]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dealers, collectors, and investors have always been concerned about the authenticity of their precious metal investments. For this reason, many world-renowned mints have focused their efforts on the implementation of forefront technologies to enhance the security of their bullion products.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Royal Canadian Mint is one of the few mints to have successfully applied several proven techniques which stand against counterfeiting and ease the bullion verification process. On the 16</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of May 2016, RCM made one more step towards reinforcing their famed craftsmanship by introducing the latest security measures for their new 2016 1 Oz. 99.99% Gold Bar.</span>

<img class="size-full wp-image-406 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/royal-canadian-mint-security-features.jpg" alt="royal-canadian-mint-security-features" width="478" height="332" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Royal Canadian Mint is a well-known precious metals refiner and manufacturer, worldwide recognized for its thorough approach to implementing the most innovative security measures.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This prestigious mint released the new 2016 1 Oz. 99.99% Gold Bar, which has carried the same weight, size and purity content, since debuting in 1999. What makes it truly special is that the new 1 Oz. Gold Bar includes the latest three RCM security enhancements:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The uniform striking line pattern</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – present on both the obverse and reverse side of the bar – being, at the same time, an exquisite touch of contemporary design and an added security feature;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The state-of-the-art micro laser-engraved maple leaf</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> –  already used for the iconic Gold and Silver Maple Leaf coins;<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-402" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rcm-security-features.jpg" alt="rcm-security-features" width="80" height="78" /></span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The micro-engraved “16” inscription inside the maple leafs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – ensuring the authentication of the bar through this new inventive way of displaying its mintage year.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The packaging of these outstanding RCM Gold Bars was also redesigned, mimicking the new lined pattern, on the front side, along with the assay certificate on the back side of the tamper-proof card.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Royal Canadian Mint has already used these bullion security enhancements for its most popular precious metals products. The stunning radial line pattern and the micro-engraved maple leaf privy mark were first introduced for the 2014 releases of the Silver Maple Leaf coin. One year later, the mint started to strike the Gold Maple Leaf coin using the same micro-engraved mark and sunburst radial lines, creating an eye-catching light-diffracting pattern and exclusive luster to these already  famous coins.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest RCM bullion products to receive the new design and security upgrades are the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/1-kilo-republic-metals-rmc-gold-bar-9999-fine-w-assay">1 Kilo Gold Bar</a> and the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/100-oz-republic-metals-rmc-silver-bar-999-fine">100 oz. Silver Bar</a>. Each of these bars is stamped with an individual serial number, the mint’s logo and the hallmarked maple leaf, placed on both sides of the weight stamp. These marks have a raised center and a depressed outline similar to the laser engraved privy mark on Silver and Gold Maple Leaf coin. Also, the serial number on the bars is bordered by vertical lines just like the pattern of the maple leaf.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another one-of-a-kind Royal Canadian Mint security initiative is their Bullion DNA Anti-counterfeiting technology launched in 2014. This cutting-edge technology is based on the unique morphological features of each bullion round, aimed to distinguish fake gold coins, as well as silver editions, from authentic Maple Leaf Coins.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve the exclusive textured maple leaf mark, which contains the last two digits of the mintage year which are only visible under magnification, the mint laser-engraves the mark on the dies that are used for striking Gold and Silver Maple Leaf Coins. Then, through use of Digital Non-destructive Activation (DNA) technology, the mint converts, encrypts and registers, in its secure database, a special digital code for every die, which is obtained by capturing a microscopic view of each die’s mark.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, when the Bullion DNA is used in store for identifying any fake maple leaf coin, the security mark of the real coin acts as a fingerprint and matches the complex digital code within the RCM die register, thus confirming its authenticity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This leading edge strategy of the Royal Canadian Mint enhances the protection of its exclusive precious metal bars and coins, thereby ensuring the safety of your future investments.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Gold: Multi-Decade Breakout Underway</title>
		<content><![CDATA[The mainstream media is largely missing the significance of the moves we are now seeing in the precious metals sector.

Most readers will already be familiar with the fundamental factors impacting gold and silver prices: unsustainable government debt, negative interest rates, unwinnable overseas wars, and a worldwide fiat currency system that has no precedent in history.

Yet the focus of our work here is not to simply repeat the headlines impacting the day-to-day price of gold. For as we have seen from the 2011-2015 drop in precious metals, one can be very right on the fundamentals impacting the market, yet prices can move in the opposite direction for a prolonged period.

We must instead let the market tell us what it wants to do, and therefore we turn to a long-term technical perspective in order to observe the trends in gold.

<strong>Gold's Long-Term Pattern</strong>

Gold has just successfully retested its breakout from a multi-decade consolidation dating between 1980 and 2009, almost three decades during which the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">price</a> was held below $850 per troy ounce. The significance of such a breakout cannot be overstated: multi-decade consolidations and breakouts usually lead to multi-decade advances, with targets many times the previous consolidation high. When we view examples throughout history of markets that have experienced similar consolidations and advances, we see that in percentage terms gold in the mid-$1300 range has only just begun to move toward its full potential.

<strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-461" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Gold-price-between-1980-and-2009.png" alt="Gold-price-1980-2009" width="1136" height="500" /></strong>

<strong>A Historical Example in the Dow</strong>

The potential for a market that consolidates for several decades and then breaks out successfully must be appreciated. Let us view an example from history of a well-known market that went through a multi-decade consolidation and successful breakout, so as to assess the ramifications of this pattern for gold.

From 1959 to 1982, the <a href="https://www.google.com/finance?cid=983582">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> consolidated between roughly 550 and just over 1,000 points. It was a choppy consolidation, but it featured a clearly defined resistance zone near 1,000, as can be seen on the chart below. For these 23 years, no one with a buy and hold strategy for US stocks made much money, and many investors gave up hope of ever making a profit.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-462" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1959-1982-Dow-Jones-Industrial-Average.png" alt="1959-1982-Dow-Jones-Industrial-Average" width="757" height="500" />

However, in 1982 the Dow finally broke out above 1,000, hitting 1,300 in the fall of 1983. Its retest of the former 1,000 resistance zone was quick, lasting from late 1983 to mid 1984, and in fact, did not fall completely back to that exact price, only briefly touching 1,100 for a low.

Once that retest proved successful, the advance was quick to accelerate. The rest, as they say, was history, as one of the greatest bull markets continued on for <em>almost as long as the consolidation</em> -- 18 years total -- and achieved <em>over a 1,000% gain from the previous all-time high </em>(hitting 11,500 in the year 2000)<em>.</em>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-464" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Dow-Jones-Industrial-Average-increase.png" alt="Dow-Jones-Industrial-Average-increase" width="666" height="500" />

<strong>Back to Gold</strong>

Gold is now positioned similarly to where the Dow was in mid-1984, when it successfully retested the 1,000 level after breaking out from its multi-decade consolidation. Gold's retest occurred in December of last year, at $1,045 per ounce.

Let us rewind the specific chronology for gold that we are referring to:

Gold peaked in 1980 near $850 per troy once, only to fall back to $255 by the year 2000 after a series of rallies and further drops.

It then took gold nine years to climb back up to $850 and exceed that level for good.

We thus view the entire 1980 - 2009 period as a multi-decade consolidation below the $850 level, and the final break above this figure as the completion of this pattern. Again, multi-decade consolidations are rare formations in the capital markets, and they usually lead to advances that measure similar amounts of time.

After gold's breakout in 2009 it surged for two more years only, hitting a new peak in 2011 at $1,923.

The bear market from 2011 - 2015 occurred entirely above the multi-decade $850/oz consolidation, and thus constitutes a retest of the former high in technical analysis.

Note that gold, similar to the Dow, has shown relative strength by not falling all the way to the $850 level for its retest, instead forming a clear bottom at $1,045 in December 2015.

Gold subsequently broke out of its primary downtrend in late February (shown by the turquoise-color channel on the main chart above), and has just had its best six-month performance gain in 40 years, with a 24% advance from January through June 2016. We now zoom in on the final part of the bear market, and the breakout seen in February.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-465 size-large" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Gold-price-chart-2014-2016-1024x766.png" alt="Gold-price-chart-2014-2016" width="840" height="628" />

<strong>The Potential for Gold </strong>

To continue with the Dow analogy above, we are looking for an advance beginning in gold that should last for a similar length of time as the consolidation from 1980-2009. In other words, a multi-decade bull market in the precious metals sector is likely now starting.

While history does not repeat exactly in markets or in life, it often rhymes.

Thus, long-term investors in the precious metals would do well to take a step back from the day-to-day price fluctuations and truly contemplate the potential presented by the first chart in this article. While volatility and corrections should always be expected in any market, we believe there is a major opportunity now unfolding in the precious metals sector.

Trying to put exact numbers on a price target at this moment can only diminish the message of the underlying strength gold is showing. But for comparison purposes, if the precious metal were to achieve an 11-fold move above it's previous all-time high as the Dow did from 1982 - 2000, it would give us a target of over $9,000 per ounce. This would happen within the timespan of the next few decades.

Our point in this piece is not to encourage readers to obsess over the final target, but rather to see this market within the context of the unique multi-decade breakout that is currently unfolding.

This pattern is rare and powerful in the financial markets, and gold is positioned at the beginning of the setup right now.

		<title>Silver - Fundamentals Reveal Large Potential</title>
		<content><![CDATA[While we tend to focus on technical indicators in our analysis of the precious metals, in this article we will examine the fundamentals drivers within the silver market.

What are the trends amongst miners, scrappers, hedgers, jewelers, industrialists, and investors? What can we see setting up for silver -- a historically monetary metal, now with significant industrial demand -- over the next decade?

Our review follows: we are more bullish than ever on <strong>silver prices</strong> and believe that the moves we have seen over the last 10 years are a mere preview of the price level that is to come over the next decade. However, investors should expect high volatility, with 25-35% price swings every year going forward.

<strong>A Review of Silver's Fundamentals</strong>

A review of the fundamental case for silver reveals a bullish scenario for those investors with at least a several year timespan and the tolerance for this high volatility.

The scenario centers on an investment premium now being priced into a historically monetary metal that concurrently has the backdrop of significant industrial demand. This industrial demand is mostly inelastic at or even above current prices.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-524" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/a_Silverfundamentals.jpg" alt="world-silver-supply-demand" width="1500" height="1125" />

<strong>Mine Supply Growing Slowly</strong>

In reviewing the past ten years of data for silver (courtesy Thompson Reuters / The Silver Institute), we find overall supply that has increased 13% since 2006 to over one billion ounces per year (first orange row on chart above). Of that, mine supply has seen consistent year over year production increases to 886M oz., while government sales have flat lined, and scrap production is down 29% over the same time period.

The data shows that mine production is the key supply source, accounting for nearly 85% of the market. This mine supply, while slowly increasing, cannot respond to quick changes in demand, as the exploration-development-extraction lifecycle for mining companies can take well over a decade to bring new silver to the market.

<strong>Silver Fabrication Demand is Inelastic</strong>

Turning to the demand side, we see that net physical demand for silver has increased roughly 13% in the past 10 years, again to over a billion ounces per year (second orange row on the chart above). While silverware use is flat and overall industrial fabrication is down slightly, zooming in on the details here gives us much more insight as to the emerging long-term trends.

The bulk of the industrial drop comes from photographic use for silver, which has fallen by over 67%, to a low of 46 million ounces in 2015. At the same time, electronic fabrication is up 2% to 246M oz., and photovoltaic use has gone from negligible to over 77M oz.

<em>The key then is to note that the bulk of the industrial drop has already occurred</em> -- in the photographic category. At current decline rates, it will only take a few more years for photographic use to be negligible. <strong>The rest of the industrial side taken as a sum shows increased demand over the last 10 years.</strong>

This increased industrial demand is largely inelastic, as can be seen by the fact that the increase has occurred during a time when silver prices have moved from an average of $6 per ounce to nearly $20 today. The reason for the inelasticity is that for most industrial applications, there is not a suitable replacement for silver. For example: in solar panels, computers, and cell phones, the total cost for silver in the manufactured components is such a small fraction of the overall materials cost, yet so essential for production, that it does not matter whether the price is $6, $20, or significantly higher.

There exists no acceptable substitute.

<strong>Silver Investment Demand is the Key Price Driver</strong>

On the investment side (highlighted in green on the chart above), the most significant item to note is that demand for coins and bars has risen nearly six-fold over the last decade to 292M oz. This demand sits at the margin, and is by far the most variable; for example falling 35% from 2011 to 2012, before rising 82% from 2012 to 2015 to the highest demand on record, 292M oz.

Yet despite the variability, the trend is clear over the last decade: silver is being demanded increasingly as an investment store of value.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-530" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/silver-fabrication-indices.jpg" alt="silver-fabrication-indices" width="840" height="693" />

<strong>Speculation as the Art of Profit</strong>

Speculation is the nature of all investment. To make a profit as investors, we must have a belief that is above and beyond what is currently accepted by the mainstream. We must view more perspective, or know more information, than the sum of the other market participants in order for there to be a discrepancy in prices. It is only in discrepancy between current prices and future prices there is the potential for gain.

So let us speculate for a moment.

Why is silver seeing this recent increase in investment demand? Why are there six times as many investment dollars buying <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/bars">silver bars</a> and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/coins">coins</a> now compared to a decade ago?

Our analysis is that silver is regaining some of its historic monetary role. Indeed, for most of the history of human civilization, while gold has traditionally served as a store of wealth, silver has been used for smaller monetary exchanges. To this day in Spanish, the word for silver is the same as the word for money ('plata'). It is only since 1965, when the last U.S. quarters and dimes containing <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/junk-silver">90% silver</a> were removed from circulation, that silver has not had a direct monetary role. We thus exist in what can be viewed as a 50-year 'experiment' in human history with silver not serving as money.

As a society, have we progressed for the first time to such an advanced level that silver is permanently relegated to a relic of monetary history? Or, does human nature move in repeating cycles, with silver beginning to reemerge as a store of value after several decades out of favor?

We turn to the market for answers. Judging from the increase in investment demand, we can see that the metal is regaining something of a monetary premium. And while the growth over the last decade is impressive, it still amounts to only 292M oz. purchased worldwide every year.

<strong>What is the Potential for Investment Demand?</strong>

To put the size of the worldwide investable silver market into perspective, 292M oz. purchased per year equates to roughly $5.8 billion.

The market cap of Apple Computer alone is over $550 billion.

Let us ask a few reasonable questions:
<ol>
 	<li>What would happen if each of the 100M households in the United States wanted to own 10 ounces of silver next year ($200 per household)? Such would equate to one billion ounces of silver demand.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
 	<li>With jewelry/silverware/industrial use consuming over 80% of the one billion ounce supply at any price, where would that silver come from?</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Moreover, what if one billion of the world's 7.3 billion residents each wanted to own a single ounce per year for the next three years?</li>
</ol>
The silver is simply not there at current prices. A major revaluation would have to occur should any additional significant demand come into the market.

Turning our attention to the long-term <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver chart</a>, note the increasing price spikes every few years (2006, 2008, 2011) with a rising linear up trend line (shown in magenta) acting as support.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-527" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/silver-price-1980-present.png" alt="silver-price-1980-present" width="1240" height="737" />

Amidst a rising mine supply and stable industrial/jewelry/silverware demand, it <em>must be the physical investment</em> demand that has caused these price spikes, as every few years a new wave of investors moves into the silver market.

<strong>Silver Price Projections</strong>

Our analysis is that silver has formed a long-term bottom in the $13 - $16 price range.

From this bottom, the trend is clear: silver is regaining a monetary/investment premium after several decades of mostly fabrication use. That fabrication demand is inelastic. The investment demand for silver is what exists at the margin, and has been the primary driver in higher silver price spikes seen over the last decade. Economic cycles tend to move in waves over time, and when a small percentage of the world's population decides to invest only a tiny fraction of its combined wealth into silver, we anticipate the price will rise to a multiple of the current level.

Our initial 3-5 year target is a retest of $50/oz. This has been a multi-decade resistance level. Once this level is broken decisively, we anticipate it will act like a floor, just as the $850 level has for gold and the $1.20 level has for copper. From there, we may reevaluate our thesis as fundamental factors warrant.

For those investors with at least a several-year time horizon and a tolerance for high volatility, the opportunity in silver looks quite significant -- from a technical and a fundamental viewpoint.

Production of 1 oz. Platinum Eagle Non-Proof Coins has decreased<b> </b>significantly since 1998, which makes these coins rare and adds to their numismatic value.

On the obverse side of the coin is depicted the “Portrait of Liberty” image, created by the Chief Sculptor-Engraver of the US Mint – John Mercanti. This design is struck on the bullion, uncirculated and proof American Eagle Coins since their debut, and represents the image of the Statue of Liberty gazing with confidence, surrounded by the engravings “2016”, “Liberty”, “In God We Trust” and “E Pluribus Unum”.

Unlike the proof edition of this stunning coin, the reverse image of the Brilliant Uncirculated Platinum Eagles doesn’t change. It depicts the magnificent bald eagle, with its wings outstretched while soaring against the sunrise. Its image is encircled by the inscriptions “$100”, “United States of America” and the engravings of the weight and purity of the coin. This impressive design was created by Thomas D. Rodgers Sr. and makes this coin a truly national coinage icon.

<h5>The reverse side of the 2016 1 oz. Platinum Eagle BU Coin designed by Thomas D. Rodgers Sr.</h5>
<strong>Why you should consider buying this remarkable platinum coin?</strong>

About ten times rarer than gold, platinum is regarded as an expensive precious metal, although over the last two years it has been traded at a lower price than gold. Along with palladium, platinum is a relative new precious metal discovered by Spanish in South America in 1735 and today, over 80% of the platinum is mined exclusively in Russia and South Africa. Besides, this precious metal is also used in jewelry and automobile industries. For this reasons, platinum bullion products are usually considered as rare collectibles and highly sought-after precious metal items.

		<title>Analysis: Gold to Dow Ratio</title>
		<content><![CDATA[The US stock market hit a new all-time high this week as fears that the Brexit fallout would spill across the Atlantic subsided somewhat. Given the strength seen in the world's largest equity market, and that we are now directly within the seasonally-weakest time period of the year for the precious metals, it is not unexpected to see some funds shift out of <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold </a>and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> and into US stocks.

Below we show the US Dow Jones Industrial Average, from the crash lows of 2009 through the present. Note how prices have just this week spiked above the 18500 level, the previous high from 2015.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-582" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/US-Dow-Jones-Industrial-Average-2009-2016.png" alt="US-Dow-Jones-Industrial-Average-2009-2016" width="1240" height="928" />

Yet generally, the proper strategy to make a solid return in the markets is not to follow the crowd and chase the best-performing assets of the last several years. Rather, the best strategy is typically to take the contrarian perspective and to try to find out what most people are ignoring.

We must remember that the chart above shows US stocks <u>priced in US dollars.</u>

As we know, the US dollar is a depreciating currency (as are all world currencies). So in the chart above we are not looking at a stable-value measure for the Dow.

It would thus be beneficial to also see the Dow as compared to another form of money: gold.

Below we show the value of the Dow compared to gold since 1980. This ratio asks: how many shares of the Dow Jones Industrial Average does it take to buy one ounce of gold?

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-583" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Dow-to-gold-ratio.png" alt="Dow-to-gold-ratio" width="1240" height="737" />

Currently it takes 0.070 shares of the Dow to buy one ounce of gold.

The all-time low value for gold relative to the Dow was set in the year 1999 when it took only 0.024 shares of the Dow to buy the same ounce.

In contrast, the all-time high for the ratio was set in 1980 at 1.00. This was at the last generational precious metals peak when, for a short period, the price of gold topped $850 per ounce and the Dow was also priced at 850.

With this historical perspective, what can we say about the current price of gold?

<strong>Gold is nowhere near a long-term peak.</strong>

In fact, gold is priced much closer to its 1999 bottom than its 1980 peak as measured against the Dow.

For example, if the ratio was to hit 1.00 again, and the Dow was to simply maintain its current value, gold would have to be re-priced to $18,500 per ounce.

Should the Dow lose half it's value and fall to 9250, gold would still need to rise 7-fold to reach this same number.

Both of these examples would feature a nominal return to the 1.00 ratio between gold and the Dow as seen in 1980.

<strong>Ratios Repeat Throughout History</strong>

Further, the 1980 peak was not the only time in history that this ratio hit 1.00.

In 1933, when gold was confiscated from American citizens by President Roosevelt and revalued during the Great Depression from $20 to $35 per ounce, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen from its peak of 400 all the way to the upper 30's.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-597" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/djia.png" alt="Dow-Jones-Average-1933-crash_" width="575" height="443" />

The gold to Dow ratio in the early 1930's thus stood at nearly 1.00.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-585" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/d_Gold_conf.jpeg" alt="Dow -ratio-1933" width="1128" height="736" />

We therefore have multiple data points throughout history of precious metals peaks in which the Dow and gold were valued the same in nominal terms. Currently at 18,500 and $1,315 respectively, clearly we are not in the territory of a long-term top in gold.

It will be important over the coming months to keep the Gold-Dow ratio in mind if we see some continued consolidation in the precious metals, and further advances in US stocks. The mainstream media will likely be fully endorsing the move higher in stocks (after all, most media conglomerates are public companies whose shares are included in the stock indices -- they thus have much to gain by encouraging individuals to bid their shares higher).

Yet those with a little historic perspective will let these moves unfold as they surely must. Even at $1,315, gold is priced closer to a bottom than a top compared to major stock markets. The reversion to a historic valuation ratio that has occurred multiple times in the past will occur again. Those who understand this phenomenon of reversion to the mean will continue to quietly accumulate gold and related assets even as the mainstream financial press focuses on the nominal new highs being made in the US stock market.

		<title>Gold Surges After Fed Meeting</title>
		<content><![CDATA[The primary driver for the precious metals last week was the Federal Reserve meeting, which concluded on Wednesday. At the meeting, the Fed once again left interest rates unchanged, at generationally-low levels targeting 0.25% - 0.50%.

Even more important than the lack of change in the target rate was the Fed's statement regarding inflation following the decision:

<em>"</em><em>Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months. "</em>

In essence, when the Fed comments that inflation expectations are low, it is signaling that it intends to spark more inflation (i.e. print more money). Gold and silver, being inflation-sensitive assets, deciphered this language and spiked immediately following the Fed announcement, with <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold rising</a> $20 for the day and silver nearly $0.70.

<strong>Fed Policy is Currency Debasement</strong>

It is important to step back for a moment and contemplate some of the policies described in the Fed's meeting statement above. Here we have a central bank explicitly stating that its policy is to debase the currency by 2 percent per year.

<strong>Two percent inflation per year, compounded, results in the currency losing 50% of its value in just 34 years.</strong>

Thus, the Fed's policy is to have savers in US dollars lose 50% of their wealth every generation.

How is it possible that citizens accept such a policy for the international reserve currency?

Our long-term thesis is that, slowly but surely, more individuals will begin to wake up the problems inherent with this official inflation policy. When citizens begin to understand this system, at least some will turn to precious metals as a form of protection. If even a small fraction of the world's population makes this decision, the metals will be forced to revalue upward significantly in the coming years.

Our charts are the maps showing these revaluations as they are occurring in real-time.

<strong>Technical Analysis on Gold</strong>

Gold is now making its second attempt at breaking out from the final long-term downtrend that has held its price in check since 2011. While it is not yet certain that this important technical level will be breached this week, we have some important early-indicator signals coming from related sectors that the expected move is not far off into the future.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-604" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Gold-price-2009-present.png" alt="Gold-price-2009-present" width="1240" height="928" />

The first attempt at breaking the long-term magenta-colored downtrend was made one month ago at $1,380, and now, as the trend inherently slopes downward, this second attempt is being seen at a slightly lower price level, near $1,365. (To be safe, we should extend this resistance zone upward to the psychologically-important $1,400 level.)

Let us zoom the above chart in to the 18-month timeframe for a closer examination:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-605" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/gold-price-2015-2016.png" alt="gold-price-2015-2016" width="1240" height="928" />

To those unfamiliar with technical analysis, the surges and retracements seen in gold recently may appear unpredictable, but with the proper technical lens, we can clearly see where large buyers and sellers are emerging.

Let us not mince words: gold is caught in the crosshairs of a significant technical battle at this exact moment. Support was seen this week after the Fed meeting where we expected, right above the green zone labeled near $1,310. Such was the second time gold has bounced at this level, increasing the validity of the support.

Note that the green support zone and the long-term downtrend are converging into the September - October timeframe. When two technical levels converge, one must necessarily give way to the other.

Moreover, gold is also firmly within the rising royal-blue parallel channel which began at the December 2015 bottom. The lower line from this pattern is rising and will also be meeting with the aforementioned two levels by mid-September.

There are thus at minimum three important technical trends that traders and investors alike are monitoring.

<strong>Clues from the Gold Mining Sector</strong>

Subtle clues are appearing that the converging patterns will result in a breakout for gold.

Below we take a quick side by side comparison of the gold miners (top) versus gold itself (bottom) for the last three months. Note that the gold miners are once again on the verge of breaking through their July highs, whereas gold bullion is still some $20 below its corresponding high.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-606" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/gold-miners-2016.png" alt="gold -miners-2016" width="460" height="667" />

The gold miners are leading the metal since the initial bottom observed last December, and are now giving us a signal that gold itself is setting up for a move higher this fall.

<strong>Long Term Ramifications for a Pending Gold Breakout</strong>

We have made the case in past work that the pending break of this 5-year downtrend in gold will set the sector up for an even more powerful scenario from a multi-decade perspective.

Similar to falling dominos, one pattern's completion triggers another to begin, the completion of which may then trigger additional patterns into the future.

Below is the 36-year perspective for gold in logarithmic format, noting the 5-year gently sloping decline that has taken the distinct shape of a "bull flag" formation. Superimposed onto this image is the textbook definition for this bull flag pattern, for reference.

It is the break of the previously-mentioned 2011-2015 downtrend that will set up the bull flag pattern to initiate.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-607" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/gold-spot-price-2011-2015.png" alt="gold-spot-price-2011-2015" width="1240" height="546" />

Bull flag formations represent a pause in an ongoing bull market. In this case, the 2001-2011 advance is seen as the initial "flag pole" surge, the 2011-2015 decline is seen as the half-way "flag" pause, and what is coming should be an advance roughly equivalent to the initial amplitude of the "flag pole".

The initial surge in gold's case measured $1,650 (the amplitude from 2001-2011), and we derive a target for the bull flag pattern by adding this figure to the most recent low of approximately $1,050.

In summary, when we witness a break of the $1,400 resistance zone, there results a strong probability that gold will see a long-term target of at least $2,700.

		<title>Gold Technical Update</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<strong>Gold Technical Update</strong>

Gold has just made its second attempt within the last five weeks at breaking through its long-term downtrend (see long-term charts on the previous article, available <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/08/01/gold-surges-fed-meeting">here</a>), and this opportunity once again proved unsuccessful. This price action increases the validity of the resistance shown by the trend line and its importance as a technical data point. Gold is going to have to prove it can overcome this level for the next leg of the bull market to commence.

Yet despite this short-term weakness, we have several reasons to believe that a breakout will be arriving shortly, and those reasons are presented herein.

Gold rose as high as $1,367 early in the week, but sellers continue to appear just above this level and the price backed off to close at $1,335 on the spot market by Friday afternoon.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-622" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Gold-rose-on-friday.png" alt="Gold-rose-on-friday" width="1240" height="928" />

As is typical, charts can often tell us "what" is setting up in the gold market, but the "why" component usually remains to be seen. So what was the cause of gold's fall on Friday? In this case, the drop was due to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) which released a "seasonally-adjusted" jobs report for July showing 255,000 jobs created for the month in the United States.

The term "seasonally-adjusted" means the number was not actually derived from a survey of employers proper, but rather estimated based on a seasonal algorithm that the BLS uses for assumed job creation, resulting from historic seasonal trends.

Interestingly, 2016 has seen the highest assumed seasonal job growth reported by the BLS in the last 10 years, as can be seen below:

<img class="alignnone wp-image-623" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/BLS-seasonal-job-growth-reported.jpg" alt="BLS-seasonal-job growth-reported" width="600" height="260" />

Exactly how they derive this assumed data is a question on many analysts' minds, but regardless of the validity of the figure, the market interpreted the announcement to be largely positive for the US dollar and the US stock market, which both spiked higher. As a result, both gold and silver were sold off.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-624" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/c_Aug5.png" alt="c_Aug5" width="972" height="648" />

We now return to the charts to guide us as to what may happen next for gold and the precious metals.

<strong>Gold is "Coiling Up"</strong>

Refer again to the first primary chart of gold at the beginning of this article. Gold is now "coiling up" between strong resistance below the previously-mentioned downtrend, and the strong support which is appearing between $1,285 and $1,306, as shown by the green band. This is labeled "Converging Patterns" on the chart.

Of course, this support zone was the former resistance zone we had been following for nearly 18 months, which, decisively broken in June, is now seeing second-chance buyers step in each time the price retreats to this zone.

When markets coil up in this manner, like a spring being held down -- eventually when released the market will experience a significant move in one direction or another.

In studying the area on the primary <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold chart</a> above representing the convergence of the downtrend resistance and the green support zone, we note that the meeting of these two trends does not necessarily have to happen until after January 2017. Technically speaking then, the market could take through the winter to break higher or lower from the convergence of these patterns.

However, in years of studying these charts, we can say that in the majority of cases the convergence will resolve itself in one direction or another before the actual meeting of the trends.

Further, based on 45 years of available data since <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> has traded free from the US dollar standard, the single strongest month of the year for gold is straight ahead: September.

We thus have a high expectation that the breaking of these converging trend patterns is going to take place within the next 4-8 weeks.

<strong>Gold Miners Still Providing Leadership Clues</strong>

The gold miners are still anticipating this breakout in the metal, as shown below by the quick reference between the HUI gold miners index on top and spot gold below.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-625" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/d_HUI_Gold.png" alt="gold-miners-anticipating-breakout -aug-2016" width="398" height="585" />

Note that the large cap miners closed the week with a marginal gain, whereas the metal finished lower by Friday. The miners indeed finished at a new 52-week closing weekly high.

This outperformance, subtle though it may seem, is continuing to give us clues regarding the resolution of the metal's converging trend patterns.

<strong>Takeaway on Gold Prices</strong>

Strong support exists between $1,285 and $1,306, while resistance is being seen above $1,365. These price levels are converging on the yearly charts, and when opposing trends converge one or the other must break. At present the seasonal strong period for precious metals is due ahead, and we observe leadership in the gold mining equities. We see a high probability of a <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> breakout within the next 4-8 weeks, with an advance to target $1,450.

		<title><![CDATA[Gold's Advance a Worldwide Phenomenon]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[We are continuing to see more evidence that the advance that is ahead of us across the precious metals complex will be a worldwide phenomenon, and not a US dollar-primary event as was seen in the bull market of the 1970's.

<img class="wp-image-646 alignleft" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/a_UKInterest.png" alt="UK-Interest-rate" width="480" height="588" />

This week the Bank of England, clearly responding to the continued tumultuous market conditions since the June 24 Brexit decision, voted to lower short-term interest rates for the first time since 2009. This brings the key lending rate to 0.25%, an all-time record low.

We thus have record low interest rates in the United States, in Europe, and now in England.

Recall that in order for central banks to force interest rates to record lows, they must do so by buying the entire short-end of the bond curve in that country. The money they use to buy those bonds is printed out of thin air, or rather created with the digital equivalent thereof.

Not only does this money creation directly devalue the currency in question, but by holding the short-end of the yield curve down, it forces investors to withdraw funds from low-yield savings accounts or short-term certificates of deposit.

Instead, investors desiring yield are funneled into riskier assets to try to achieve any sort of reasonable income from their capital.

It is any wonder then that the London FTSE 100 stock index is approaching all-time highs? Or that British 10-year government bond yields are approaching all-time lows -- which means their prices are also at all-time highs?

<strong>London FTSE 100 Index since crash of 2008</strong><img class="wp-image-633 size-large aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/b-London-FTSE-100-Index-since-crash-of-2008-819x1024.png" alt="b-London-FTSE 100-Index-since crash-of-2008" width="819" height="1024" />

&nbsp;

<strong>UK Government 10-year Bond Yields</strong>

<img class="wp-image-635 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/c-UK-Government-10-year-Bond-Yields.png" alt="UK-Government-10-year-Bond-Yields" width="779" height="699" />

&nbsp;
<h2>Money "sloshing around" the system</h2>
All this freshly-created central bank money is now "sloshing around" the financial and political system, bidding up stock prices, bidding up bonds, bidding up mortgages, funding endless unwinnable wars...

The world has seen several stock-market bubbles over the last 100 years, but has never seen a bond bubble in the way we are now witnessing.

Furthermore, when we study the past we see examples of when certain individual countries have gone down the path of excess money-printing, but we have no examples of a time in which the entire world was engaged in the practice simultaneously.

We are living in an unprecedented time in world history.

What we can conclude based on a study of past asset bubble deflations is that precious metals -- the only store of wealth that politicians or central bankers cannot debase -- will in some way fit into the solution when the bubbles eventually burst.

It is important for us as investors who sometimes focus on the shorter-term patterns setting up in the metals to not lose sight of the unprecedented bigger picture that is developing.

When only a fraction of stock or bond investors, markets which are much larger in total dollar value than <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> combined, decide to move only a fraction of their combined wealth into the precious metals, the upward revaluation will be beyond anything we have witnessed thus far.

It is likely that the 30% <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">surge in gold</a> and the 45% <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">surge in silver</a> seen in the last six months represent those early to jump ship from the aforementioned bubble markets and to move some of their capital into the historic metallic stores of wealth. Yet as we see the bubbles still continuing to inflate, we can deduce that we have not yet seen the critical mass begin to move into gold and silver in a meaningful way.
<h2>Update - Gold in Australian Dollars</h2>
We continue to monitor gold as priced in Australian dollars (AUD) as a leading indicator for gold in other major world currencies.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-636" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/d-Gold-in-Australian-dollar.png" alt="Gold-in-Australian-dollar" width="1240" height="737" />

The all-time high for gold in AUD was in 2011 at just over $1,850 per ounce. Gold in AUD closed this week at $1,756, less than 6% away from the all-time high.

We have seen 6% surges in gold in one week in the past, so a retest of this level is possible at any time.

When gold decisively breaks to a new all-time high in AUD, it will serve as a signal to the rest of the world that such advances are in store for other major currencies. What was once viewed as a USD-only phenomenon is starting to be recognized in no uncertain terms as worldwide trend in rising gold demand.

		<title><![CDATA[Gold & Silver Technical Update]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[In technical analysis we place a greater emphasis on long-term trendlines for good reason.

For over seven weeks now <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> has continued to bump against its final 2011-2016 downtrend, which has held prices lower since the 2011 high of $1,923 per ounce. Every time it attempts to break higher above this down-sloping resistance level, sellers immediately show up to drive the price back down.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-663" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/a-Gold-2009-present.png" alt="Gold-2009-present" width="1240" height="928" />

There is clearly a battle going on at this exact moment between bulls and bears. Bears know that if this long-term technical resistance level is broken, it will send a signal to the many investors waiting on the sidelines that the time has arrived to jump back into precious metals market. And when an influx of new technical buyers all enter at once -- a surge in price is going to result. The bears are therefore defending this exact technical level we are monitoring. The tightness of the battle is now evident down to the intraday level, where we have observed sellers appearing above $1,355 per ounce and buyers appearing in the $1,330 region over the last week.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-664" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/b_Gold-1year-forecast.png" alt="Gold-1year-forecast" width="1240" height="928" />

What the tightness of this consolidation means is that the market is nearing a resolution. Typically the break of a significant long-term trend line in gold will result in a quick $50 - $100 movement in price. Following that initial break, a retracement toward the trend line will generally occur. The degree to which gold fully or only partially comes back to retest its broken trend line will give us clues as to the strength of the subsequent advance.

Of course, let us not get ahead of ourselves: the technical breakout has not yet occurred. For the week, gold finished higher marginally by $3.00 to close at $1,346.20, for a modest 0.2% gain from a week prior.

<strong>Seasonal Indian Demand Ahead</strong>

Despite the continued consolidation, sellers will have to be quite determined if they are to continue holding back the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">price of gold</a> once demand begins to emerge within the next month from India. It is during this late August through September period when increased physical demand is seen year after year prior to the Indian wedding season, which begins in October.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-665" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/c-gold-demand-country.png" alt="gold-demand-country" width="764" height="726" />

Let us not overlook: Indian demand is critically significant in the physical market. As shown above, India consumes more gold per year than any other country outside China, and more than the United States and Europe combined. And the majority of this demand occurs in the period prior to the October wedding season.

As precious metals investors, we are thus biding our time in waiting mode to monitor the strength of the coming seasonal demand.

&nbsp;

<strong>Silver Update</strong><strong> </strong>

Silver is currently within a midpoint consolidation pattern, with well-defined resistance appearing on the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">charts</a> between $20.60 - $20.70. Minor support has appeared over the last seven weeks near $19.20; however, stronger long-term support appears between the $17.50 - $18.50 price zone.

Silver's consolidation is part of a series of imbedded patterns which have appeared since the bottom was confirmed in December 2015 at $13.65 per ounce.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-666" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/d-Silver-2013-16.png" alt="Silver-2013-16" width="1240" height="1119" />

Silver's actual bottom took the shape of a bottoming wedge formation, shown in the chart above in turquoise color, indicating broken trend lines. The bottoming wedge is a pattern in which both highs and lows are falling, yet highs are falling at a steeper rate than the subsequent lows. This pattern indicates that buyers are stepping in at relatively higher levels on each decline. The pattern tends to represent a terminal bottom formation, in which buyers eventually overcome sellers and a trend reversal is seen. Silver broke out of the formation in February 2016 and confirmed the December bottom, shown by the red highlight circle above.<strong> </strong>

Remember that these formations merely show us the levels at which large buyers and sellers are entering the market, and the patterns which are defining their behavior. If we study the behavior of large investors and align ourselves with them, we stand to time our entry and exit points better and to potentially achieve a greater profit.

Since the bottom, silver has formed a series of imbedded head and shoulder patterns, the first level of which took place below $16.00, shown in royal blue above.

After breaking higher from $16.00 in April, this pattern targeted $18.25, which was hit in June.

Since achieving its level 1 target, silver now finds itself in the midst of a second-level head and shoulders pattern, which is shown above in the magenta color. The price target for this pattern is between $21.50 - $23.00, and this target is yet to be achieved. $21.50 - $23.00 thus remains our open target for silver's next advance.

Note that silver has a tendency to overshoot technical patterns, as it is a small market and is prone to extreme swings in either direction. We thus maintain the possibility that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> may overshoot its next target and reach $25 within the next several months, which is an area of strong resistance dating back to 2012.

It is expected that silver will begin this next advance concurrently to gold's breaking of its long-term downtrend, referenced in the gold analysis above.

		<title><![CDATA[NEW! The 2016 S&W Silver Proof American Liberty Medals now available on Bullion Exchanges!]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Mint issued, for the first time since 2011, a new bullion medal available in two, S and W, mintmark versions - the 2016 Silver Proof American Liberty Medal. This stunning silver proof medal got quickly sold out during the first 8 minutes from the moment it was placed for sale on the mint’s website on August 23</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2016.</span>

<b>Hurry up! Get your 2016 S&amp;W Silver Proof American Liberty Medals before they become out of stock!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The exceptional 2016 S&amp;W Silver Proof American Liberty Medals showcase a fresh, contemporary design of Liberty, incorporating the ideals of hope and courage. At the same time, the US Mint used its latest manufacturing and digital technology to produce this remarkable bullion product. This fantastic silver proof medal is the symbol of the American proud numismatic heritage and the Nation’s glimmering future because it replicated the praised obverse and reverse design of the $100 American Liberty High Relief Gold Coin, released in 2015.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-675" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-W-S-Silver-Proof-American-Liberty-Medal.jpg" alt="2016-W-S-Silver-Proof-American-Liberty-Medal" width="900" height="900" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The heads design of the medal was created by Justin Kunz - the talented US Mint Artistic Infusion Program (AIP) designer. It showcases a new representation of Liberty as a modern woman wearing a crown of olive leaves while trustfully holding in her hands the American flag and a lighted torch. This powerful image was sculpted by the remarkable Phebe Hemphill, who delicately engraved her and designer’s initials on the obverse side, along with the inscriptions “Liberty” and “2016”.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the reverse side of the medal is depicted the majestic representation of the beloved American Eagle, created by another talented AIP designer - Paul C. Balan. The image was sculpted by Don Everhart II, the US Mint Sculptor-Engraver, and features a gorgeous eagle gripping an olive branch in its talons while rising in flight – the “embodiment of freedom”. Its image is surrounded by the “DE” and “PCB” initials, the “S” or “W” mintmark and the engraving “United States of America”.</span>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-677" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-w-silver-proof-american-liberty-medal.jpg" alt="2016-w-silver-proof-american-liberty-medal" width="900" height="900" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-676" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-s-silver-proof-american-liberty-medal.jpg" alt="2016-s-silver-proof-american-liberty-medal" width="900" height="900" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/government-mints/us-mint/">US Mint</a> struck this beautiful silver proof medals at the West Point and San Francisco facilities by using the American Silver Eagle blanks made of 1 oz. of .999 fine silver. Unlike the Liberty gold coin issued in 2015, the 40.6 mm silver proof Liberty medal is not legal tender, and it doesn’t carry a denomination. The US Mint set a production limit of only 12,500 medals and a household limit of just 2 medals per household.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Shipped encapsulated and carefully placed in a delicate blue velvet display mint box, along with a Certificate of Authenticity, the Silver Proof American Liberty Medal is considered a treasured addition for passionate investors and collectors all over the world.

		<title>Markets at Crossroads</title>
		<content><![CDATA[Several interrelated markets are simultaneously at important crossroads, so we want to be aware and prepared for the possibilities that may soon materialize. The (northern hemisphere) summer months tend to be the slowest time of the year not just for precious metals, but for many of the capital markets. There is an old saying: “Sell in May and go away.” Certain years this is more useful advice than others, but the point is that we are nearing the end of what has essentially been range-bound action across the precious metals, stock markets, and currency markets since late spring, even with the dramatic events associated with Brexit in June. One way or another, it appears likely that market action is going to start getting more “interesting” after the end of the summer season, which culminates unofficially on the Labor Day holiday in the US next Monday, September 5.

&nbsp;

<strong>US Stock Market</strong>

The US stock market continues to meander higher, defying most recent analysts’ attempts to pinpoint a top. We remain a somewhat detached observer of the action in broad US stocks, as we hold no investments in them directly. However, all markets are somewhat interrelated, and as precious metals and stocks can sometimes be counter-cyclical, we are, by owning precious metals, by default “short” such other markets.

Taking the long-term view of the US Dow Jones Industrial Average, the most likely scenario we see is that the market is forming a generational-timeframe “expanding megaphone” top. The expanding megaphone is a topping pattern with several successive highs and successive lows, each high being above the previous high, and each low being below the previous low. It takes the shape of an expanding outward cone or megaphone. The pattern shows a bifurcated market experiencing extreme swings in psychology every several years, a scenario which usually does not end with a positive resolution.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-685" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/a-stocks-dow-1980-present.png" alt="stocks-dow -1980-present" width="1240" height="928" />

We have had three hits along the upper trend line of this pattern since the year 2000, and two hits on the lower trend. Consequently, the pattern calls for a drop in the Dow down to the lower trend line at minimum, for a third hit, at some point over the next 3-5 years. Based on the projection, this would equate roughly Dow 5,000.

Long-term patterns such as this are certainly not appropriate for immediate trading, and indeed as we have seen potential tops can take much longer to materialize than most anticipate. It is quite possible for the stock market to continue grinding higher for another year or two as part of this formation.

However, the level of complacency seen in the market now is certainly at levels ripe for a top to form. Most employees are blissfully happy to continue contributing to stock 401(k) retirement funds, secure in the knowledge of slow and steady annual gains.

History shows that such psychological complacency is typically a precursor to significant market corrections.

&nbsp;

<strong>US Bond Market</strong>

In generations past, bonds and stocks were considered opposite ends of the investment spectrum. Stocks were seen as vehicles for growth and appreciation, and bonds were seen as investments for safety. As such, during times when stocks fell, funds often moved into bonds. And during times when stocks were appreciating, money conversely moved out of bonds.

With the advent of unprecedented money-printing by the Fed after the 2008 financial crisis, all of that changed. For the first time in the modern era, since 2008 we have seen both stock and bonds rising in near unison. Keep in mind the above graph of the Dow – which is at an all-time high -- when we look at the following graph of US 30-year bond prices over the same time period:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-686" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/b-us-bonds-1980-present.png" alt="us-bonds-1980-present" width="1240" height="737" />

As we can see, US 30-year bond prices are also at all-time highs, which is what has forced their yields to all-time lows.

This is the first occasion in modern US history when both stock and bond prices are simultaneously at all-time highs. When we say we are living through an unprecedented time, we mean it literally.

How is it possible that so much money is flowing both into stocks (growth assets) and bonds (safety assets) at the same time?

The answer is simple. The Fed has printed so much money over the last eight years, that it is searching for a home somewhere… anywhere. Fundamentals have been pushed aside, and money is flowing wherever it can in search of some type of return.

The Fed has turned on a fire hose in an attempt to fill a bathtub. While the tub is certainly getting filled, so is the rest of the bathroom, the living room, and the downstairs apartment, for that matter.

The only question that remains is where is all this money going to flow when these trends reverse, and we see what may be for the first time in history falling stock and bond prices simultaneously?

It is estimated that the size of the global bond market is roughly $100 trillion, while the size of the global equity markets are nearly $70 trillion. Meanwhile, the dollar amount of all the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold </a>ever mined in the history of the world is close to $8 trillion, but less than half of that is available for investment (the rest is held as jewelry and industrial fabrication).

What is setting up when even a small portion of the $170 trillion in combined bond + equity markets attempts to start exiting those assets and to find a home in precious metals will make the moves we have witnessed thus far look like a mere warmup.

Stay tuned… the bubble behavior in bonds and stocks has not culminated yet… but Stein’s Law says: “That which cannot continue forever will one day stop.” And that day is drawing closer.

&nbsp;

<strong>Gold Analysis</strong>

Despite the $20 or 1.5% drop seen in gold this week and the whipsawing that occurred on Friday after Yellen’s comments, the situation in the world’s monetary element remains largely unchanged from a technical standpoint.

On the near-term <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">chart gold</a> is still awaiting a resolution of the convergence of the multiple trend lines we have been monitoring since June. Resistance continues to appear every time gold approaches $1,355 - $1,378, while support is emerging above the $1,285 - $1,306 zone labeled in green. Gold’s primary blue rising channel remains in play until proven otherwise, and one or more of these trends will be forced to break within the next 6 weeks.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-687" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/c-gold-2015-2017-forecast.png" alt="-gold-2015-2017-forecast" width="1240" height="928" />

The action on Friday, although disappointing to watch throughout the day, was not altogether bad from a technical perspective. Below we are zooming the above chart in to the 1-month perspective to analyze the Japanese candlesticks -- each representing one day’s price action:

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-688" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/d-candlesticks.png" alt="candlesticks" width="131" height="196" />

The pattern seen on Friday is called a gravestone doji in Japanese candlestick analysis, because it looks like a gravestone with a long upper shadow. Context is critical for evaluation of these candlesticks. When gravestone dojis occur after a strong advance, they can be a sign of a top, as the price rises above a specific price level but then falls back below it later in the day.

Yet when gravestone dojis occur near an area of support, they typically indicate budding strength to come. In this case, we can see a very similar doji that appeared three weeks prior, circled in red. Note that the day represented a local support, after which prices rose over the next week.

Gravestone dojis do not always represent exact bottoms, but they do show us that there are buyers lurking in the background. The pattern should be considered a warning to the bears that they are losing their grip on the recent decline.

If a short-term bottom indeed emerges here after this gravestone doji, we will be looking for another attempt at gold breaking its long-term (magenta) downtrend within the next 1-2 weeks.

This breathtaking rendition of an iconic 1916 design is expected to sell out in less than an hour, just like the previous coin in the anniversary series - the 2016 Mercury Dime Centennial Gold Coin.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-700" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-standing-liberty-quarter-centennial-gold-coin.jpg" alt="2016-standing-liberty-quarter-centennial-gold--coin" width="750" height="750" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US mint centenary anniversary series includes renditions of the three most beloved numismatic coins of 1916:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2016 Mercury Dime Centennial Gold Coin, released in April 2016</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 Standing Liberty Quarter Centennial Gold Coin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, offered on September 8, 2016</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2016 Walking Liberty Half Dollar Centennial Gold Coin – TBD.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These long-awaited gold coins are highly sought-after by collectors all over the world due to the tremendous popularity of the original circulating coins.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-701" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-standing-liberty-quarter-gold-coin.jpg" alt="2016-standing-liberty-quarter-gold--coin" width="750" height="750" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2016 Standing Liberty Quarter <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins/us-commemorative-coins/2016-centennial">Centennial Gold Coin</a> features the original Bare Breasted “Standing Liberty” depiction, designed by the talented sculptor Hermon A. MacNeil and used for the circulating coin in 1916. However, the image was changed for the 1917-1930 coin issues, having Liberty covered with a chainmail either as a World War I symbol or because of multiple complaints regarding her nudity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the obverse side of this splendid gold coin is engraved the image of Liberty holding a shield in her left hand and an olive branch in her right hand while stepping through a wall opening which contains the 13 five-pointed stars – the symbol of the Original Thirteen Colonies. This outstanding representation also contains the engravings “Liberty”, “In God We Trust”, “2016”, “AU 24K”, “1/4 oz”, “W” mintmark and the designer’s initial “M”. The reverse side of this beautiful centennial coin showcases a majestic eagle with its wings outstretched, flanked by the 13 stars, seven on the left and six on the right, and encircled by the inscriptions “Quarter Dollar”, “E Pluribus Unum” and “United States of America”.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This spectacular coin was struck at the West Point facility from 1/4 troy ounces of .9999 pure gold, the size being the symbol of the coin’s face value. It was produced with reeded edges and business strike finish, with a limited mintage of 100,000 bullion coins and a limited household order of just one coin. The US Mint will provide each coin encapsulated and delicately hand-packaged in an elegant custom-designed black matte hardwood presentation box, accompanied by a Certificate of Authenticity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the first centennial coin, the Mercury Dime Gold Coin which went off-sale in less than an hour, the new 2016 Standing Liberty Quarter Centennial Gold Coin is expected to become a treasured keepsake for numismatists and a must-have for any collector.</span>

		<title>G20 Meeting to Start a Busy Month in Currency Markets</title>
		<content><![CDATA[Yesterday, Monday, September 5 is Labor Day here in the United States. As such, US markets were closed. Trading has occurred in <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> on other world exchanges... yet as the volume of contracts traded is still mostly dominated by the New York COMEX, we were hesitant to expect any significant moves until Tuesday.

We recently reviewed the first-half 2016 statistics for gold. The international store of wealth had its best first-half in over 30 years -- on a percentage basis up 26%. It is easy to overlook that statistic amidst the consolidation we have seen since June.

Yet that number is telling us something. Tensions must be brewing in the world financial system for gold to rise so significantly in such a short time. For the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">price</a> to rise $300 in six months, large entities were purchasing hundreds of tonnes of metal for weeks on end. We cannot be certain for what reasons they were acting -- those reasons will reveal themselves in time -- but there are four important events coming up over the next 6 weeks that could all have significant impacts on the currency and precious metals markets. They are:

<strong>September 5</strong> - the G20 countries conclude their meeting in Hangzhou, China.

<strong>September 21</strong> - the US Federal Reserve releases its decision on interest rates.

<strong>September 30</strong> - the Chinese yuan is formally included in the SDR reserve system. (The SDR or Special Drawing Right is an International Monetary Fund (IMF) basket of currencies that is increasingly being used instead of the US dollar for loans or aid to recipient nations.)

<strong>October 7</strong> - the IMF conducts its annual meeting in Washington, D.C.

One way or another, it appears that the season set to begin on Tuesday will not feature the same range-bound action that we have witnessed for the last 10 weeks. Things are going to get more volatile, more exciting. We expect these trends to move upward for gold and silver, but if anything changes on that outlook we will be writing about it here.

<u> </u>

<strong><u>US Dollar</u></strong>

On the topic of the currency markets, let us take a look at the action in the US Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of foreign currencies including the Euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Swedish krona, and the Swiss franc. Despite the surge in the US dollar on the June 24 Brexit vote, the chart of the world’s reserve currency is increasingly looking fragile.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-708" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/a-USD-Index.png" alt="USD-Index" width="1240" height="737" />

&nbsp;

The dollar has been consolidating for nearly 20 months. Resistance is well-defined between 99-100 on the Index.  Meanwhile, each successive move into the support zone near 93 has shown technical "cracks". First in August 2015, we note the low in the Dollar Index broke briefly lower to 92, and then in May 2015 the low broke further again to 91.5. These technical cracks in the form of lower lows are alerting us that buyers are not as determined to support the dollar at this juncture as some might assume.

Currently, the dollar finds itself perched precariously just above a short-term support line at 94. A break below 94 and the dollar will be retesting recent lows near 91-92 in short order. Based on the technical weakness observed over the last year, it is likely that if such a retest does occur, it will fail, and the dollar will be heading to new multi-year lows.

This would be positive for the precious metals. While over the long run <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> will be moving higher regardless of the currency denomination, over the short run we should expect to see a more significant move if the US dollar begins to falter.

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Gold Update</u></strong>

Below is the updated 18-month chart for gold. For 10-weeks now gold has been stuck in a consolidation of just 5.5%, between $1,303 and $1,378. Big buyers have bought... big sellers have sold... and now most market participants are waiting -- to see who shows up next. Because after a period of low volatility, the next arrival of a new group of buyers or sellers will determine the market trend for the intermediate future.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The advances seen on Friday in both gold and silver were related to the release of US employment data, which missed analyst estimates. Payrolls were reported at 151,000 additions in August, which was lower than the median forecast of 180,000. The US dollar fell on the news, as the chance of a Federal Reserve rate hike at the upcoming September meeting was dimmed. Conversely, gold and silver both rose.

For the week, gold finished with a nominal gain of $0.80, to close at $1,326 as of the NY COMEX close.

Notably, gold bounced right at the upper region of our green support band shown above, at $1,303 on Thursday.

We continue to watch for a break above the declining magenta-colored long-term downtrend for a signal that the next stage of the bull market will soon begin.

&nbsp;

<b>The 2017 Lunar Rooster Gold &amp; Silver Proof &amp; Bullion coins</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The internationally renowned Australian </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/australian-gold-coins/perth-mint-gold-lunar"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/coins/australian-silver-coins/silver-lunar-coins"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lunar Series II will be completed with the 2017 proof and bullion issues that celebrate the Year of the Rooster – the 10</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> animal in the Chinese Zodiac Calendar. The birth dates for the ‘Year of the Rooster’ are 1921, 1933, 1945, 1957, 1969, 1981, 1993, 2005, and 2017. The people born under this sign are considered as hardworking, honest, loyal, and sociable. These famous Lunar Series coins will be struck from .9999 pure gold and .9999 pure silver in proof and bullion quality.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lunar Rooster Proof Gold Coins will be available in three sizes, 1 oz., ¼ oz. and 1/10 oz., as well as in a three-coin set. These remarkable coins will have a limited issue: no more than 3,000 1oz. coins, 5,000 ¼ coins, 4,000 1/10 oz. coins and 1,500 three-coin sets. The bullion edition will have an unlimited issue of 1/20 oz., 1/10 oz., ¼ oz., ½ oz., 2 oz., 10 oz. and 1 kg gold coins and a maximum of 30,000 1 oz. coins which are expected to be highly collectable. Both proof and bullions coins will depict on their reverse side the new ‘Year of the Rooster’ design: a rooster standing in front of a stylized Chinese scene with bamboo and leaves, encircled by the inscription ‘Year of the Rooster’, the Chinese character for ‘rooster’ and the ‘P’ mintmark.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-727" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/The-2017-Lunar-Rooster-Gold-Silver-Proof-Bullion-coins.jpg" alt="2017-Lunar-Rooster-Gold-Silver-Proof-Bullion-coins" width="842" height="431" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lunar Rooster Proof Silver Coins are also available in three sizes, 1 kilo, 1 oz. and ½ oz. and the three-coin set. These fantastic coins will have a limited issue of 500 1 kilo coins, 5,000 1 oz. coins, 8,000 ½ oz. coins, and 1,000 three-coin sets. The bullion versions will have an unlimited issue of 1 kg, 10 oz., 5 oz., 2 oz., and ½ oz. coins and a maximum of 100 10 kg. and 300,000 1 oz. silver coins. Just like the gold edition, the 1 oz. silver bullion “The Year of Rooster” coin is expected to sell out quickly. Both proof and bullion silver coins feature on their reverse side the new ‘Year of the Rooster’ design: the rooster, hen and the three chicks standing amongst flowers and bamboo, surrounded by the ‘P’ mintmark, the engraving ‘Year of the Rooster’ and the Chinese character for ‘rooster’.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>4</b><b>th</b><b> issue in the adorable Cubs series – </b><span style="line-height: 1.75;">This year’s latest Perth Mint release - the Cub series - will be completed with the fourth coin - the September Cubs - which features the playful white lion cubs from South Africa, Timbavati region. This impressive coin will be struck as a Tuvalu legal tender coin, made from ½ oz. of .999 fine silver with a limited mintage of 5,000 coins, depicting the cute white lion design.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The white lion’s color of the coat is white, almost blonde color, which is much lighter than the usual tawny African lion. These lion species are in fact the same, but their white coat is the result of a recessive gene that is carried by both parents which can give birth to both tawny and white cubs. The previous coins depicted the tiger, jaguar and snow leopard cubs and the lynx cub will be depicted on the last, fifth coin in the series.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-728" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/White-Lion-Cubs-2016-½-Silver-Proof-Coin.jpg" alt="White-Lion-Cubs-2016-1-2-Silver-Proof-Coin" width="840" height="500" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the reverse side of this amazing coin are depicted two colored white lion cubs that are playing in the savannah’s grass, surrounded by the word “CUBS” and the ‘P’ mintmark. Besides the classic Perth Mint presentation case, the mint also provides a special display box which can be completed with all five coins that will protect and present them in a superb way.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">**</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the obverse side of each of these coins is engraved the effigy of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, designed by Ian Rank-Broadley, along with the coin’s face value, weight and purity marks. The Star Trek Delta Shaped Silver coin and 2016 White Lion Cubs ½ Silver Proof Coin also contain the “Tuvalu” inscription, while the obverse side of the other coins contains the “Australia” engraving.</span>

		<title>Bond Jitters and Precious Metals Updates</title>
		<content><![CDATA[Coming into September, and especially with the drop in stocks on Friday, there is a lot of fear about what will happen over the next few weeks in the markets.

There seems to be a general sense of unease that develops during September and October, likely due to the high confluence of market crashes that have occurred during this time. The stock market crash of 1929 began in October of that year. The crash of 1987 occurred in October as well. And the financial crisis of 2008 intensified rapidly during September and October.

Perhaps there is something ingrained in our seasonal cycle as human beings that leads us to grow cautious as the days become shorter and the temperatures get colder (in the northern hemisphere)... and somehow this innate worry translates into a high correlation with stock market panics over the last 100 years.

Friday saw a strong down day in US stocks, as it appears the summer lull has ended for the markets. The S&amp;P 500 Index of US companies fell nearly 2.4% for the day, the largest percentage drop since the day of the Brexit vote in June.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-733" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/a_Friday-SP-500-Index-US-companies.png" alt="Friday-S&amp;P-500-Index-US-companies" width="1002" height="670" />

&nbsp;

Yet the interesting point is that US 20-year bonds -- which throughout most of history would see safe-haven buying on a strong down day in stocks -- fell on Friday as well. This is most unusual, and merits close monitoring over the months to come, as it is a fundamental component of our long-term thesis for ownership of <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/how-to/gold-vs-silver-vs-platinum-vs-palladium">precious metals</a>. That is: if both stocks and bonds were to fall for the first time in unison over the years to come -- gold would emerge as a final safety asset.

Indeed, although gold was down on Friday by 0.6%, it performed well on a relative basis when compared to bonds, which were down 1.6%.

Relative strength is an indicator we use quite frequently, as it shows certain investors stepping in to buy one asset, even as most other assets are being sold. This is especially important when comparing typical "safety" assets. While one-day of price action is not enough to call this a trend, in prior articles we have discussed why we are on alert for what will eventually be a 35+ year top in long bonds at some point before the close of the decade.

Where will the world turn for safety when US bonds, the asset known to fulfill this role for over a generation, loses its status as such?

A long-term decline in bonds coinciding with a long-term decline in stocks would be something never witnessed in modern history... but all signs indicate that it is exactly the scenario which is now brewing. Of course, bubbles are notorious for taking longer to pop than most people expect -- and thus there still may be one more final "blow-off" phase in US bond prices that perhaps could see yields go fully negative (as they have in other countries). But "the writing is on the wall" for what is coming, and it is going to be a fascinating time not only to be an investor, but generally to be a citizen of this world.

<strong>Gold Update</strong>

Gold saw nothing less than its fourth attempt this week to overcome the long-term resistance that we have been monitoring for the better part of the last three months, the price level for which currently comes in near $1,360. The price spiked up to $1,356 on Monday and Tuesday, and then once again sellers showed up during the remainder of the week to drive the price back down toward $1,330. This consolidation between $1,300 and the downtrend line referenced in the magenta color has been ongoing for 11-weeks now, and it is nearing a resolution.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-734" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/b_Gold1Y.png" alt="Gold-1year-forecast" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

The reason we are paying so much attention to the pending break of this long-term trendline is that it is going to represent the shifting in psychology from bear to bull market for the final group of investors who are still clinging to the possibility that gold will be making a new low, below the December 2015 bottom at $1,045.

The price action that we witness after these converging sets of trend lines resolve should not resemble what has happened over the last several months. A stronger trending move should occur, which will result in a new wave of investors becoming interested in the sector.

Although it appears on the chart above that the converging consolidation could last through February 2017, in studying these types of patterns in the past we can say that they generally do not last beyond the 2/3 timeframe mark. The pattern is currently nearing the half-way mark, and we feel a break is imminent at any time now. It would take a drop in gold below the bottom level of the green support zone -- $1,285 -- to make us question the likelihood for the anticipated advance to come this fall.

For now, we continue to see buyers step into the gold market each time the price approaches $1,300.

&nbsp;

<strong>Silver Update</strong>

After making another attempt to overcome the key psychological $20 figure, silver fell back starting on Wednesday and finished flat for the week, closing just above $19.

Of note is the weakness that silver saw on Friday relative to gold, falling 2.8% to gold's 0.6% by the close of the day. This phenomenon is common on days when the stock market is seeing a strong sell-off and gold is falling even modestly. In such instances silver tends to multiply the losses in the two markets, seeing selling both from the precious metals sector and also from the industrial sector.

In a steady stock market with rising <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold prices</a>, it is often the case that silver will amplify the gains in <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> as it benefits from both sectors.

This is all part of silver's dual-personality behavior, which makes it one of the most interesting yet volatile commodities in the world. We are now seeing 5% intra-week swings in this precious metal, which will only amplify over the next few years.

With the approach of $20 this week and then backing off again into the mid-range of the consolidation, silver's short-term pattern is increasingly appearing to be a bull-flag correction. Seen often on individual stocks, this pattern generally represents a half-way downward-sloping pause in a primary advance.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-735" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/c_Silver-price-1year.png" alt="Silver-price-1year" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

In this case, the surge (or "pole" of the flag pole) was from early June at $15.80 through July at $21.25: an amplitude of $5.45.

<a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver</a> made a 2-week bottom in mid-August at $18.50, and it is quite possible that this was the low for the bull flag correction.

With an amplitude of $5.45, the pattern would target a <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver price</a> of $25.45 when added to the breakout point of the flag. Such is in line with our expectations for silver's seasonal advance to come. We will confirm the pattern when the short-term (dashed teal-color) resistance line is broken to the upside.

Our worst-case scenario would be for silver to fall into the lower range of the green support band near $17.50 prior to its next attempt at an advance.

<b>Get your unique </b><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/2016-w-1-oz-proof-silver-american-eagle-w-box-coa"><b>2016 1 oz. Proof Silver American Eagle Coin</b></a><b> with smooth, lettered edge celebrating 30</b><b>th</b><b> years of minting excellence!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/government-mints/us-mint"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Mint </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrates 30 years since the release of this exceptional coin. The first Proof American Silver Eagles have been produced in 1986. Since their release up until 1992, the coins carried the “S” mintmark of the San Francisco facility. Between 1993 and 2000, the coins displayed the “P” mintmark, being produced at the Philadelphia facility while starting with 2001 (except for 2009 when the US Mint didn’t issue any Proof Silver Eagles) the coins carry the “W” mintmark and are struck at the West Point facility. The splendid 2016 Proof Silver American Eagle Coin consists of one troy ounce of .999 pure silver, has an exceptional mirror-like finish, comes with the $1 face value, and its weight and purity are guaranteed by the US Government.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the obverse side of the coin is displayed the prize worthy image designed by Adolph A. Weinman, the famous American sculptor-engraver. The image represents the well-known Walking Liberty design which was previously struck on the Walking Liberty Half Dollars and features the Lady Liberty holding laurel and oak branches in her left hand while moving confidently towards the sunlight - the symbol of our Nation’s strength. The graceful full-length figure of Liberty is enveloped in the US Flag’s folds and surrounded by the inscriptions “Liberty”, “In God We Trust”, and “2016”.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-746" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-W-1-oz-Proof-Silver-American-Eagle-back.jpg" alt="2016-W-1-oz-Proof-Silver-American-Eagle-back" width="800" height="800" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reverse design of the Proof Silver American Eagles was created by the former US Mint Chief Sculptor-Engraver, John M. Mercanti, and showcases the image of the majestic heraldic eagle, holding an olive branch in its right talon, arrows in its left talon, a banner with the words “E Pluribus Unum” in its beak and carrying its shield. This representation is the symbol of the preparedness to defend the United States of America, as well as the desire for peace. The thirteen stars symbolizing the thirteen original colonies are displayed above the eagle’s image, which is encircled by the engravings “One Dollar”, “United States of America” and the weight and purity of the coin.</span>

		<title>Rising Interest Rates Correspond with Rising Gold Prices</title>
		<content><![CDATA[Gold's summer consolidation stretches on for another week, and this time tests the lower boundary of the support zone labeled below, closing at $1,310. For the week, the international currency of last resort closed down by $24 or some 1.8%.

This was the 4th distinct hit on the green support zone since June, which closely matches the number of attempts gold has made to overcome the long-term downtrend shown below in magenta. All eyes now turn to the US Federal Reserve policy meeting on Wednesday as the next likely catalyst to kick gold out of this consolidation in one way or another.

<img class="size-full wp-image-753 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/a_Gold.png" alt="a_Gold-FED-polycy" width="1240" height="928" />

On the subject of the coming Fed meeting, there is a continuous falsehood portrayed in the mainstream media regarding the effects of rising interest rates on the prices of precious metals. Another one of these misleading articles was published this week in Bloomberg.

&nbsp;

<strong>The falsehood is that rising interest rates are negative for precious metals.</strong>

The theory is that rising interest rates increase the attractiveness of interest-bearing accounts, such as US dollar-denominated bonds or savings accounts. This, in turn, should cause investors to turn away from gold, as it pays no interest.

The mainstream media will publish articles explaining this theory every few months, typically when gold has been weak in price, as a way to explain the recent trading action. Here is a snippet of the recent article from Bloomberg and the highlighted section reveals the erroneous statement: <em>"Gold would get hit pretty hard in a rising rate environment."</em>

<em><img class="size-full wp-image-754 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/b_Article-Bloomberg-Gold.png" alt="Article-Bloomberg -Gold" width="643" height="898" /></em>

Yet the actual data for rising interest rates and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">precious metals prices</a> is completely contrary to this statement. All we need to do is examine the history of rising interest rate cycles and gold prices, and the correlation is plain to see.

&nbsp;

<strong>Interest Rates and Precious Metals Prices</strong>

Let us give two examples to illustrate the true correlation between short-term interest rates and precious metals prices.

First, the example from the most recent multi-year rate hike cycle. Below is a chart of the 2003 - 2007 time period, showing short-term interest rates rising from 1% to 5.25%. Following that is a <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">chart of gold prices</a> over the same time period.

&nbsp;

<img class="size-full wp-image-757 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/C_Fed_20032007.jpg" alt="Fed-20032007" width="798" height="357" />

<img class="size-full wp-image-758 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/D_Gold_2003-2007.jpg" alt="Gold-Price-2003-2007" width="886" height="578" />

Here, we can clearly see that a rise in interest rates corresponded to a rise in gold prices, as the price of the metal rose from $325 to over $800 during this same time period.

Now let us look at a longer-term example, the multi-decade rise in interest rates from 1955 - 1980.

<img class="size-full wp-image-759 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/E_Fed-Funds-rate-1955-1980.jpg" alt="Fed-Funds-rate-1955-1980" width="645" height="359" />

<img class="size-full wp-image-760 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/F_Gold-1955-1980.jpg" alt="Gold-1955-1980" width="876" height="579" />

To be as concise as possible: a rising interest rate environment over these 25 years was the backdrop to the largest precious metals bull market in modern history, as gold broke the dollar standard at $35 per ounce and advanced over 2,000% through 1980.

&nbsp;

<strong>Why do precious metals rise with rising interest rates?</strong>

In order for this to make sense, we must alter our perspective of the Federal Reserve from what is discussed in the news. <strong>The Fed is a reactive, not a proactive organization.</strong> The Fed responds to incoming data related to prices, employment, and the solvency of its own member banks -- and then responds with monetary policy after the fact.

The Fed has no crystal ball. Being reactive, when would the Fed logically decide to raise interest rates? Only when it is forced to do so. In other words, the Fed raises interest rates only when the inflationary effects of its previous money-printing cycle are starting to be obvious in the broader economy.

<a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold </a>is the ultimate protection from inflation, and this is why it tends to rise in a rising interest rate environment. Like a well-trained hound, gold sniffs out looming inflation better than any data possibly could.

It is uncertain why the mainstream media continues to purport this false idea regarding rising interest rates and precious metals prices. It may simply be one of those myths that takes on a life of its own, or it may be scare tactics designed to separate investors from their gold at critical junctures. Regardless of the cause, one would think that such prominent news organizations would check their data before publishing these claims.

<strong>So, for the record: when do gold prices fall relative to interest rates?</strong>

A careful look at the correlation between gold bear markets and interest rate cycles over the last 70 years reveals that <em>gold typically declines <u>after the peak</u> of a rate cycle and as rates remain falling or low</em>. Such was the case for the peak and subsequent declines in gold both in 1980 and in 2011.

Current interest rates at 0.25 - 0.50%, having fallen since 2008 in the short-term cycle and since 1980 in the long-term cycle, are nowhere near a peak at this juncture. If anything rates are now forming a long-term low, from which we may see decades of increases into the future.

<img class="size-full wp-image-761 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/G_Fed-Interest-Rate-History.png" alt="Fed-Interest-Rate-History" width="1500" height="579" />

&nbsp;

<strong>One Final Point</strong><strong> </strong>

This long-term perspective does not necessarily mean that gold will rise on the day of a Fed interest rate hike, whether it be this week, or at the next meeting in December. As ironic as it may be, some short-term traders believe the myth they have been taught through these erroneous articles, and so it becomes self-fulfilling as they sell gold on the news of a rate hike.  All the while, long-term investors are accumulating the metal knowing that the inflation from years of money-printing is starting to appear in the system.

Do not be mislead by the mainstream press: the Fed is reactionary. It increases rates when inflation is noticeable -- and history shows gold rises over the course of such cycles.

		<title>Fed Hints at Rate Hike in December</title>
		<content><![CDATA[While the Fed this week once <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/09/19/rising-interest-rates-correspond-gold-prices/">again </a>did not raise interest rates, the significant surge in precious metals seen on Wednesday was based on the change in the wording used in the accompanying policy statement. Whereas over the past few meetings the Fed has given little indication that it was considering a second interest rate hike, this time the central bank used the following distinct language: <em>"The case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened."</em>

As investors, we must remember that we are still living in an unprecedented age for low interest rates. At the 0.25% - 0.50% target rate, this is still the lowest that interest rates have been in the history of the Federal Reserve, including the following two critical time periods:
<ul>
 	<li>The Great Depression: rates hit a low of 1.5%</li>
 	<li>World War II: rates hit a low of 1.0%</li>
</ul>
Can we imagine that what is happening in the world economy currently must be deemed by the Federal Reserve to be more severe than both the Great Depression and the largest international conflict in the history of planet Earth?

Not only are rates lower than in each of these periods, but they have been held lower for a greater number of years than at each of these previous troughs, now eight years and counting below the 1.0% mark. Of course, holding interest rates so low requires a continuous electronic "printing" of new money, which is used to buy the entire short-end of the interbank bond curve. The longer that rates are held below what the market would naturally set them at -- usually between 2.0% - 5.0% -- the more inflation the Fed is building underneath the system.

The data to support this coming wave of inflation can be seen from the graph of the total reserve balances held at the Fed. Recall that what appears on this chart is money the Fed has created in order to buy sufficient bonds needed to force interest rates lower:

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-772" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/a_total_reserve_balances_maintained_with_federal_r.jpg" alt="total-reserve-balances-maintained-with-federal-reserve-banks" width="1220" height="556" />

&nbsp;

We can see that there is no precedent for the amount of money created since 2008. The Fed -- and other major world central banks -- have embarked on a money-printing spree that will go down in history as an experiment like none other. Note that there <strong>*is*</strong> a line on this graph dating back to 1950... it is just so low on the Y-axis that it barely registers when compared to the nearly $2.4 trillion created by the bank since 2008.

The strange thing about inflation is that once central banks create it -- they cannot control precisely where it flows after it enters the broad economy. Similar to turning on a fire hose in an attempt to water the garden flowers, some may flow to the intended destination, but far more will eventually flow to unintended areas.

Thus far, the recipients for most of the inflation are clear, and we have discussed them in past articles: world bond and stock markets, which are both at all-time highs simultaneously (in itself an unprecedented situation).

But nothing happens in a vacuum.

Newton's Third Law of Physics says: "For every action there is an opposite and equal reaction." And it appears that the unintended consequence of the Fed's actions are about to be felt elsewhere: in the US dollar.

&nbsp;

<strong><u>US Dollar</u></strong>

The chart below shows the US dollar as measured by the Dollar Index, a trade-weighted basket that measures the value of the US currency versus the sum of the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Euro (EUR), 57.6% weight</li>
 	<li>Japanese yen (JPY) 13.6% weight</li>
 	<li>Pound sterling (GBP), 11.9% weight</li>
 	<li>Canadian dollar (CAD), 9.1% weight</li>
 	<li>Swedish krona (SEK), 4.2% weight</li>
 	<li>Swiss franc (CHF) 3.6% weight</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-773" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/b_USD-index.png" alt="usd-index" width="1125" height="669" />

&nbsp;

We have been following this chart now for several months, as the dollar has been consolidating for nearly two years between the 92 level and the 100 level on the index.

Over the long run, we expect <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> to be moving higher in all currencies, no matter what happens with one fiat currency versus another... but over the short run, gold tends to see its most significant advances when the US dollar is weak, as <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold is priced</a> primarily in US dollars for purposes of international trade.

Thus, let us remember that the advance seen in gold from the December 2015 low of $1,045 per ounce to the recent high of $1,378 has taken place within a backdrop of a relatively stable US dollar, which has only fallen from 100 to 95 on the Index.

It appears that gold is now waiting for further signals from the currency market in order to begin its next move, and as the dollar has continued to consolidate, so has gold.

Yet these consolidations will not continue forever.

&nbsp;

<strong>Recent Technical Analysis on the Dollar</strong>

On the chart above, we can see converging sets of trendlines, shown in royal blue for primary downward trend and teal for short-term uptrend. These trends have been converging since December 2015 and May 2016, respectively. One of these trends is due to break within the next 4-8 weeks.

While consolidations such as this are inherently neutral when viewed in isolation (they can break either upward or downward), when we view the action within the context of the preceding advance the nearly two-year consolidation in the dollar is increasingly taking the form of a broad long-term top. Indeed, it would be rare to see such a lengthy pattern result in a continuation move higher.

From the short-term perspective, our "hints" that the break will be lower come from the two cracks in the support zone below 93 on the index. These cracks have been warning signs that buyers of the dollar are not as resolute in supporting the currency as many would believe. This is in contrast to the resistance zone at 100, which has shown very distinct and unhesitant selling pressure each time that level is reached.

Should the lower converging (teal color) trendline break in the dollar in the coming weeks, the currency should be making new lows below the 92 region in short order. This move is expected to coincide with the converse breaking of the long-term downtrend that has held the price of gold lower from 2011 - present (see Gold Analysis, below).

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Gold Analysis</u></strong>

Gold made another attempt to overcome its long-term downtrend this week, reaching $1,343 on Thursday before falling back to $1,337 by the end of the week.

This was the fifth attempt by gold to break higher from the current consolidation. Each attempt represents another opportunity as buyers chip away at the overhang of sellers. Although we cannot be certain exactly when the line is going to be crossed, a breakout of this magnitude will leave no doubts when it does occur.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-774" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/c_Gold-price-2015-2016.png" alt="gold-price-2015-2016" width="959" height="718" />

&nbsp;

Resistance is clearly defined by the downtrend as between $1,355 - $1,378.

The rising blue trend channel since the December lows is now coming into focus for support near $1,310, and immediately below that the support zone that has held since June comes in between $1,285 - $1,305.

Longer-term, we must remember that the bottom seen last December was nothing less than a retest of a multi-decade breakout from the 1980 - 2009 consolidation in gold. The move seen from 2009 - 2011 was the initial surge from the breakout. However, multi-decade breakouts do not tend to see their advances finish in two years only. A more significant advance is believed to be in the early stages of developing.

		<title><![CDATA[Gold Tests Important Trend & Dow / Gold Ratio Update]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Since the December 2015 bottom in precious metals, gold has risen $272 or 26% from the low of $1,045 per ounce, to close at $1,317 last Friday. From a technical observation, gold is now directly meeting with its rising linear trendline from the absolute lows (shown in blue). This line acted as support to mark the end of the correction in early June. Of course, the line simply represents big buyers who have been showing up in the gold market at increasingly higher levels over the last six months -- and we now want to see if they will show up again this week, just above $1,300.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-783" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_Gold-price-2015-2016.png" alt="gold-price-2015-2016" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

It will be an important test for gold. If the trend channel from the lows is going to hold, it will exert itself within the next 2-3 days, and the price should fail to close below the line for more than one day. This would then set up gold to attempt to break its long-term downtrend (magenta color) by mid-October.

Should the trendline fail -- it will constitute a technical breakdown in the short-term, but all hope will not be lost for the intermediate outlook . The support zone in the region of $1,306 -- which extends down to $1,285 and is shown in green -- has held <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> higher on four separate occasions over the last three months, and it is expected to continue to do so should the linear trend no longer remain in tact.

As investors in the volatile metals, we must expect the prices to move in a series of surges, consolidations, and corrections over the course of the next several years.

Nearing the bottom of the most recent trading range, the mood in the precious metals community has turned decidedly negative in the short-run, despite what has been less than a 5% correction in the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> since late-June. Recent headlines from Bloomberg this week include "Bulls Feeling Frayed as Gold's First-Half Run Fades Into History" and "Gold-Mining Investors hit by the Hitters as Share Rally Sputters".

It is said that corrections can manifest either in price or in time -- and in this case it is clearly happening in the later. Yet no matter which form they take, both price and time corrections serve to set the stage for the next round of advances as weak hands get flushed out of the market and new investors arrive.

When viewing mainstream articles that focus mostly on sentiment, it is helpful to remember that sentiment must necessarily be worst in the terminal stages of a correction, as quotes and headlines come from those who have already sold. And when a critical majority has sold, this is when a bottom in price is imminent.
<h2>Dow / Gold Ratio Update</h2>
The <strong>Dow to Gold ratio</strong> provides an excellent way to view the long-term real value potential for gold relative to the broad US stock market.

As discussed in past articles, the ratio has approached a 1:1 reading twice prior in the last century at precious metals peaks: in 1932 when the Dow crashed to the low 40's and gold was revalued from $20 to $35 per ounce, and again in 1980 when the Dow sat at 850 and gold exceeded $850 per ounce.

We expect that the ratio will hit 1:1 again before this cycle is completed in favor of precious metals.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-784" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/b_Dow-Gold-ratio-long-term.png" alt="dow-gold-ratio-long-term" width="1340" height="737" />

&nbsp;

Updating the analysis, with the Dow at 18,308 as of Friday, September 30 and gold at $1,314 per ounce, the ratio stands at 13.9 : 1. The 1:1 target could thus occur with stocks staying flat and gold approaching $18,000 per ounce, or the Dow falling to 2,500 and gold rising to meet it at $2,500 per ounce. Either way, the result should be over a 90% loss in value in real terms for US stocks before the next precious metals peak occurs.

Although such gains for gold or drops in the Dow may seem extreme given current prices, imagine that the same must have been felt with gold at $35 per ounce and the Dow at 900 in 1968. Yet the two did meet 12 years later.

Presently, the Dow / Gold ratio is in the later stages of a counter-cyclical uptrend, shown by the blue line above, amidst the generational downtrend shown in magenta.

Zooming in above on the counter-cyclical uptrend in favor of stocks since 2011, we see that the advance in the ratio has been halted by the declining long-term downtrend, and is now forming an ugly topping pattern, seen as a bearish-slanted head &amp; shoulders formation in the Dow / Gold Ratio:

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-785" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/c_Dow-Gold-ratio-2012-2016.png" alt="dow-gold-ratio-2012-2016" width="1240" height="737" />

&nbsp;

Once the support of the right shoulder is breached, the intermediate downward target for the pattern is measured at 9.0 on the Dow / Gold ratio, which should correspond to either the loss in value in stocks or the surge in price in gold -- both of which will cause increased attention toward precious metals amongst mainstream investors.

		<title><![CDATA[Gold & Silver Technical Updates]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Last week gold broke down through both its rising linear trendline and the $1,285 - $1,305 horizontal support that had been supporting <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">prices</a> since the June Brexit vote. By the end of the week gold had closed at $1,257. The importance of these trendlines is apparent as once they were broken to the downside, a cascade of selling was observed in the futures market.

The first point is we must acknowledge the determination of the sellers who showed up each time at the declining long-term (magenta color) downtrend. These long-term trendlines are critical to monitor for exactly the reason that their strength can be so high -- as can be the significance of their eventual breaking.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-794" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_Gold-downtrend-2016.png" alt="gold-downtrend-2016" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

Our best assessment is that the potential for the next low to form will be in the range of $1,200 - $1,251 for gold. Although this is a wide range that is not suitable for short-term trading, there are a confluence of support levels in this region where we place the highest likelihood for a low to now form in gold:
<ul>
 	<li>$,1251 - the 61.8% Fibonacci level of the primary December through July advance.</li>
 	<li>$1,232 - an equal-distance decline of the $$73 amplitude of the June through September consolidation between $1,305 and $1,378.</li>
 	<li>$1,212 - the 50% Fibonacci level of the same advance.</li>
 	<li>$1,200 - horizontal support which held from February through June.</li>
</ul>
When there is a confluence of four technical support levels within such a range, we place a high likelihood for the next intermediate low to form within this price zone.

We should also note that immediately below this support zone is what is labeled "Must Hold Zone" for gold. This region is defined by the 38.2% Fibonacci level of the primary advance at $1,173 and broken October 2015 resistance-turned-support which is appearing near $1,200. This zone represents the lowest possible support for which we could still maintain the thesis that gold is in a new bull market. A break below $1,173 would raise the scenario that gold would form a new low below $1,045 in 2017. We place the probability of this scenario as low at present, but the support region must be mentioned in the course of due diligence.

<strong>Silver Update</strong>

Silver has now come to the lower range of our likely support zone at $17.50, which is also matching the rising linear trendline of the entire advance since the January lows. This further matches closely with the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the advance at $17.42.

The rising linear trendline from the lows has been broken. A recovery of the trend within 1-3 days would constitute a false breakdown in our analysis, but we would need to see <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">prices</a> stabilize above $17.95 by Tuesday for this scenario to manifest.

The bullish posture for silver will remain in tact as long as prices remain above the swing low of $15.85 from June. Such would place the current low at higher than the June low, and maintain the series of higher lows that is essential to the early phases of a new bull market.

We do not have a similar "Must Hold Zone" for <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> as <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is seen to be the primary determinant for the precious metals complex at this juncture.

&nbsp;

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Chinese Buyers Away Last Week?</strong>

An interesting theory has been circulating that last week's declines in precious metals were purposefully orchestrated to coincide with the ironically-named "Golden Week" period in China. During this semi-annual 7-day holiday, the Chinese financial markets are closed, including the new Shanghai Gold Exchange. As China is still the world's largest consumer of gold, there is merit to the idea that Chinese firms would have withdrawn their bids for physical metal prior to the week, which would have left the market more vulnerable to short sellers.

Ultimately we cannot know the exact extent to which the holiday impacted the losses in the metals last week. We must play the cards we are dealt, and that includes the breakdowns seen over the last several trading days. No matter who did the selling, we want to chart that activity as accurately as possible. My ultimate belief is that any attempts to manipulate markets can only succeed in the short run. The longer a market is suppressed, the more imbalance builds up beneath the system, and like a beach ball held under water, one day it will eventually shoot higher into the air. Throughout history groups have attempted to prop up or suppress one market or another, but they universally fail -- and this time will be no different.

		<title>Gold Predicts Advance in the US Dollar</title>
		<content><![CDATA[The big driver impacting the precious metals market this past week has been the US dollar. We have been watching this converging wedge formation in the dollar index, a measure of the US dollar versus a basket of foreign currencies, for several months, and this past week the formation broke higher in favor of the dollar (see red highlight circle in the chart below).

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-801" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_gold-price-USD.png" alt="gold-price-usd" width="1240" height="737" />

&nbsp;

As we know, over the short run <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold tends</a> to move inversely to the US dollar.

Interestingly, gold had broken below its $1,305 consolidation support <em>a week before</em> the dollar broke higher from the pattern above. Gold, essentially, anticipated the strengthening of the US dollar prior to it actually occurring.

We can see the inverse correlation between the dollar and gold on the chart below clearly over the last 3 weeks.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-802" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/b_USD-Gold-correlation-october.png" alt="usd-gold-correlation-october" width="838" height="559" />

&nbsp;

Now since October 6, gold has been giving the opposite signal to the preemptive drop from late September. Essentially, gold has moved sideways in a consolidation since that date, even as the dollar has continued to rise.

What gold is saying over the last few weeks is that it doesn't "believe" the dollar's most recent advance is going to last.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Watching for a Top in the US Dollar</strong>

Refer back to the US dollar index chart at the top of the article.

Again, the dollar has broken higher from the wedge consolidation defined by the two converging trendlines since May of this year. Closing at 98 on the dollar index last week, it has been the 3 point move higher from 95 to 98 which has resulted in gold's drop from $1,315 to $1,250.

The dollar is now nearing another test of the 100 level on the index, a measure which has acted as resistance for the last two years.

&nbsp;

We will be watching the action in the US dollar index carefully over the next few weeks. <strong>Should the dollar further levitate toward the 100 resistance zone while gold continues to hold its recent lows, it will be a strong signal that the dollar is putting in a long-term top in this region.</strong> Accordingly, the most recent decline in gold will be seen to be simply the first minor correction in the early phases of a long-term secular advance higher, an advance that ultimately should correspond with a worldwide awakening to the knowledge that all currencies -- not just the US dollar -- are inherently flawed in their present fiat form.

That said, and as we have witnessed, we should expect the most sizeable moves in gold to occur opposite the US dollar, as a weakening in the world's reserve currency will have an outsized impact on the entire world financial system as it is defined in the post-Bretton Woods era.

Let us watch the related moves in the dollar index and gold closely over the next several weeks.
<h2>Gold Analysis</h2>
For the week, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> was up $3 from the Friday prior to close near $1,255 on the New York COMEX exchange.

The historic store of wealth is attempting to stabilize in the strong support zone we have identified below in green. Notably, thus far despite several intraday drops into the zone, buyers have stepped in each time and the precious metals has closed each day above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire December through July advance. This level comes in at $1,251.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-803" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/c_Gold-downtrend-october.png" alt="gold-downtrend-october" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

The higher within the zone of $1,200 - $1,251 that gold can stabilize, the more likely that the long-term downtrend line (magenta color) will be broken on the next series of attempts, which early estimates suggest could occur as early as December.

As technical-based analysts also looking at downside potential, we continue to identify the $1,173 price level as the final "must hold" zone for gold's new bull market. If this level were to breach, it would tell us that -- despite the fundamentals that we know to be true (worldwide central bank money printing, unprecedented low interest rates, unsustainable debt levels) -- another fundamental factor must then be impacting the markets that we must not be fully aware of.

One of the founding principles of our investment philosophy is we cannot possibly know ever factor that is impacting a set market at a given time, because the market is composed of hundreds of millions of individuals, each with their own set of hopes, fears, strengths, weaknesses, assumptions, research, and goals.

Yet to be successful, we do not need to know what each individual is thinking. By paying attention to the sum of the market -- which manifests in the price that is printed each day -- we can align ourselves with the strongest trend as it is occurring.

We have no desire to be right on the fundamentals but wrong on the actual market, a problem which plagues many fundamental-only based investors. As of now, it still appears that the December bottom was an important long-term flexion point... but if anything changes this outlook, we will be sharing it with you here.

<b>The new 2017 lunar rooster coin editions</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Perth Mint also delights its collectors with an excellent gift for any baby born in 2017 – the ½ oz. Baby Rooster Silver Proof Coin.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These thrilling coins are offered in a classic black presentation case, but the gilded version is also available for collectors encapsulated and in a special case for displaying the full 12 lunar coins set.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">**</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The obverse sides of all the Perth Mint coins portray the famous effigy of Queen Elizabeth II, created by Ian Rank-Broadley, which is surrounded by the coin’s denomination, size and purity inscriptions, and the “Australia” engraving (except for the lynx cubs and baby rooster coins which contain the “Tuvalu” lettering).</span>

&nbsp;

		<title>US Dollar and Gold Continue Positive Correlation</title>
		<content><![CDATA[The positive correlation we were monitoring last week between the US dollar and the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> has become even more pronounced since the last update. The US dollar, as measured by the Dollar Index, has continued to rise toward medium-term resistance on the charts near the 100 level. Meanwhile, gold is refusing to break down below its recent low of $1,243 set on October 7.

These time periods in which both the US dollar and gold move in the same direction are rare, but not unheard of altogether. They tend to happen during one of two main scenarios:

1) Market panics -- when both assets are viewed as safe-havens, and rise simultaneously (or after the panic ends, when both fall simultaneously).

2) At major inflection points -- when one market is advancing, but the other market does not "believe" the legitimacy of the other market's move.

We see no panic in the stock or currency markets recently, so it appears that as of today, it is gold which is not believing the US dollar's continued advance.

The update below continues from our chart last week, and shows both <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and the US dollar since the recent gold low of $1,243 on October 7 (UUP is the proxy ETF for the US dollar index, GLD the proxy for gold):

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-824" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_UUP-GLD-october-2016.png" alt="uup-gld-october-2016" width="641" height="425" />

&nbsp;

In the absence of a market panic, this simultaneous movement by both gold and the US dollar in the same direction will not last forever.

One of these markets will soon be proven "wrong".

Should the dollar continue to advance toward the 100 level while gold remains firm, the precious metal will be signaling that the dollar is due to put in its final medium-term top of the nearly 2-year consolidation shown below, before the next reversal should take it below 92 into 2017:

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-825" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/b_USD-index.png" alt="usd-index-october-2016" width="1240" height="737" />

&nbsp;

However, should the dollar advance above 100 in a meaningful way, we would need to monitor the action in gold closely, as it could represent a major headwind for the precious metals market for at least the next year.

As of present gold continues to show little respect for the dollar's advance.

Note that on the chart above, the RSI indicator (top section) has once again approached the overbought level above 70, which has marked previous tops in the dollar to within a few weeks through 2015.

Because the dollar is approaching important long-term resistance, we will continue to show the dollar/gold relationship on a regular basis over the coming months. Especially with the possibility of a Fed interest rate hike before the New Year, and with the US election only two weeks away -- the major currency markets are primed for trend-setting action through December.

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Gold Update</u></strong>

As of the New York COMEX close on Friday afternoon, gold had gained $12.20 for the week or nearly 1%, to close at $1,267.70.

Looking ahead, initial resistance will be showing up in the former support zone which was broken during the early October decline, between $1,285 and $1,305. With a high probability, we expect buyers will need at least two distinct attempts to break through this resistance level.

For support, we are looking for gold to continue stabilizing above or within the zone of $1,200 - $1,251, shown below in the green band. If gold can maintain the recent October 7 low of $1,243 as the bottom for this correction, it will be setting up a bullish posture to overcome the declining long-term downtrend (magenta color) as early as December, and at latest by March.

We continue to believe the overcoming of this long-term downtrend will represent a major shifting point in the psychology of the precious metals market, and should precede a significant dollar-negative event by 6-12 months.

We note that the RSI indicator (top of chart) had become the most oversold since just prior to the December 2015 bottom. In a bull market, RSI readings below 30 generally signify medium-term bottoms, although this does not preclude the possibility of further time needed within the support zone over the coming months.

&nbsp;

*****

As the US election is just over two weeks away, during the next two weeks we will have increased commentary on how the election results may impact the markets, most notably the US stock market, and of course the precious metals.

		<title>Introducing  PAMP Suisse 1 oz Rhodium Bar at Bullion Exchanges.</title>
		<content><![CDATA[Bullion Exchanges recently made a special arrangement with <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/private-mints/pamp-suisse">PAMP Suisse</a> to be the first retail on the bullion market, offering this unique 1 oz PAMP Suisse Rhodium Bar .999 Fine.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-830" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-oz-PAMP-Suisse-Rhodium-Bar-front.jpg" alt="1-oz-pamp-suisse-rhodium-bar-front" width="900" height="900" />

&nbsp;

Rhodium is one of the most expensive and valued precious metals, which can cost ten times as much as gold or even more. Although rhodium is generally not advised as a practical material, because it’s very difficult to “make it work” properly for bullion craftsmanship, rhodium is absolutely fabulous metal for ingots mintage, because of its luminous, glittering, white and mirror-like characteristics. Rhodium has the highest reflectance among the precious metals. This rare metal was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston, an English chemist. He isolated rhodium from a sample of platinum that was obtained in South America. For this reason, rhodium is classified as a member of the platinum group of metals (ruthenium, palladium, osmium, iridium). Most of the rhodium sold in the United States is used to make alloys. This silvery-white transition metal can enhance the appearance and longevity of any metal to which it was applied.

PAMP bars are always sold out at the first release days because this brand is recognized and considered as a leading independent refinery by traders and investors all across the globe. Accredited by the Swiss Federal Bureau, PAMP Suisse bars are individually registered and sealed in Assay holders which guarantee the fineness and content of the product. Made in Switzerland since 1979, PAMP bars are the most highly sought ingots on the precious metals market.

1 oz PAMP Suisse Rhodium Bar is minted using the highest Swiss engineering skills and the latest manufacturing technologies of the prestigious PAMP Suisse. Its fantastic design and rare metal content make this bar wildly demanded and highly collectible. As other PAMP bars, this rhodium ingot is housed in an Assay card, certifying its .999 Fine purity, the weight of 1 troy ounce, and high quality. PAMP Suisse’s technological advances and bars design set them apart from them other bars in industry. The PAMP Suisse bars feature the image of Lady Fortuna, a Roman goddess who brings people good luck and fortune. A timeless symbol of luck, chance, and fate, Lady Fortuna had a crucial part in the Roman religion. She is usually depicted holding a cornucopia from which all good things are coming, but also blind, which means good luck does not always reach those who seem to deserve it.

		<title>2017 Chinese Silver Pandas now available at Bullion Exchanges</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/coins/chinese-silver-coins/silver-pandas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese Silver Panda Coins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of the most eagerly awaited numismatic issues, is now added to Bullion Exchanges comprehensive selection of coins. Its release date is October 28</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (available in US in mid-December), announced by the People’s Bank of China, along with the official 2017 design of the coin – a lovely panda bear sitting down a bamboo background and eating a bamboo branch.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-851" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2017-Chinese-Silver-Panda-coins.jpg" alt="2017-chinese-silver-panda-coins" width="900" height="900" /></span>

<b>Get your stunning </b><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/2017-30-gram-chinese-silver-panda-bu"><b>2017 Chinese Silver Panda</b></a><b> from Bullion Exchanges!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduced in 1982 (first gold coin) and 1983 (first silver coin), the Chinese Panda program is one of the most highly anticipated series on the precious metals market. Coin enthusiasts and numismatists all over the world are anxiously waiting for each coin release due to their unique reverse designs that depict a new panda image each year (except for the 2001 and 2002 that share the same design).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The People’s Bank of China has announced that the silver pandas will be available as of  the 28</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of October, yet the coins will reach the US bullion market close to mid-December. The bank also announced this year’s design of the reverse side of the coin – a single panda eating a bamboo branch while sitting down on a bamboo background. This lovely image is surrounded by the face value of the coin, as well as its purity and weight. The 2017 reverse image is reminiscent of the 2015-coin edition, which contains the same elements but displayed from an opposite perspective. Some sources state that this year’s design is courtesy of a new mint designer, but this information is yet to be confirmed.</span>

		<title>2017 brings the 1st Silver, Platinum, and new Gold Krugerrand Sizes</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, the South African Government celebrates the 50</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anniversary of the first ever gold bullion coin in the world – the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/catalogsearch/result/?cat=0&amp;q=2017+krugerrands"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold Krugerrand</span></a>. To commemorate 50 years of excellence in producing this stunning gold coin, the South African Mint will release several exceptional world premieres: the first 1 oz. Silver Krugerrand (released on December 5th, 2016), the first 1 oz. Proof Platinum Krugerrand and the first 50 oz., 5 oz., 1/20 oz., and 1/50 oz. Proof Gold Krugerrand.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">**</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1967, the 1 oz. Gold Krugerrand was released to promote the </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/south-african"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South African gold</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and help it establish as an international investment vehicle. Today, the name Gold Krugerrand is the renowned worldwide symbol for investing in gold. However, the year 2017 will give you several new reasons to associate this prestigious name with the most exclusive and astounding coin releases on the bullion market:</span>

&nbsp;

<b>The first 1 oz. Silver Krugerrand</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Enthusiast numismatists of the series have been waiting for a long time for the Krugerrand silver edition to debut. Over this period, many counterfeit silver Krugerrands have been confusing collectors that this coin exists. Finally, in 2017, The Silver Krugerrand became a reality, being also the first Krugerrand that carries an actual face value of 1 Rand. The coin showcases the same obverse and reverse designs of the original gold coin, created by Otto Schultz and Coert Steynberg, except for the content inscription and the small privy stamp with the encircled “50” engraving. The South African Mint will issue the first 1 oz. Silver Krugerrand from .999 pure silver, available in two versions: Premium Uncirculated, available from December 5th, 2016, (having a higher quality than the common Bullion Uncirculated), with a limited mintage of 500,000 coins, and Proof, with an issue limit of 15,000 coins.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, a few of these coins will be included in some mint’s anniversary sets. The first <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-south-africa-1-oz-silver-krugerrand-bu">1 oz. Silver Krugerrand</a> will be a fantastic addition, highly awaited by investors and collectors around the world for 50 years.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>The first 1 oz. Proof Platinum Krugerrand</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The brand-new Silver Krugerrand is not the only anniversary achievement from the South African Mint. In 2017, the mint will also issue the very first <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-south-africa-1-oz-platinum-krugerrand-proof">1 oz. Proof Platinum Krugerrand Coin</a>. The 1,967 proof .9999 fine platinum coins with a 10 Rand face value will represent the mint’s unique commitment to celebrating the year when this famous coin was released for the first time - 1967. The coins will feature the same design as the original Krugerrands, except for the content engraving, and are expected to be highly collectible.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>The first 50 oz., 5 oz., 1/20 oz., and 1/50 oz. Proof Gold Krugerrands</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The South African Ministry of Finance authorized the production of the 50 oz., 5 oz., 1/20 oz., and 1/50 oz. Gold Krugerrands – the biggest and smallest Krugerrands in history. These wonderful coins will be struck from .9167 pure gold, yet will contain their exact engraved amount of pure gold, just like all </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/south-african/gold-kruggerand"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold Krugerrands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The coins will display the same design and will have a limited issue of 50,000 coins for 1/50 oz., 20,000 coins for 1/20 oz., 500 coins for 5 oz., and just 50 coins for the 50 oz. size. The last coin size is a huge sensation, having a 4” diameter and over 1.6 kg in weight, being the special 50</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-anniversary edition of the Gold Krugerrand. The mint will also issue the standard </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-south-africa-1-oz-gold-krugerrand-bu-50th-annv-privy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 oz. coin with a special 50th anniversary privy mark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<b>The South African Mint</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The official mint of the Republic of South Africa has over 100 years of experience in producing high-quality circulation and commemorative coins. The South African Mint was founded in 1886 by Paul Kruger in Pretoria and was run by the British Royal Mint up until 1941. Starting from 1961, the mint produces the country’s official currency and the most renowned </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gold bullion coin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highly praised by investors all over the world – the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-south-africa-1-oz-gold-krugerrand-bu">Gold Krugerrand</a>.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>The History of Gold Krugerrands</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/catalogsearch/result/?cat=0&amp;q=2017+krugerrands"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold Krugerrands</span></a> were the first gold bullion coins designed to be a convenient way of owning some of the South African gold. The first Gold Krugerrand coin was struck by the South African Mint on the 3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of July 1967 from 22K gold, yet contained exactly 1 oz. pure gold – a trademark of the mint’s excellence. Today, the term “Krugerrand” is known by millions of investors around the world. The coin’s name was inspired by the renowned South African President, Paul Kruger, and the country’s monetary currency – Rand. The obverse design of the coin was based on the ZAR (Zuid Afrikaansche Republiek) coin, also known as the Kruger Pond, which depicted the profile portrait of President Kruger. On the reverse side of the coin is engraved the stunning image of a prancing Springbok, the iconic African antelope. In 1980, the mint added three new fractional sizes: 1/10 oz., ¼ oz. and ½ oz. Each of these coins contains the exact amount of gold. Therefore, their weight is a little higher due to the additional content of copper. As the first gold bullion coin in the world, the Gold Krugerrand was an instant success on the bullion market and continues to be one of the most popular collectibles in the world.</span>

		<title>Americans Wary of Both Candidates - How Will Markets Respond?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[The US election is only eight days away, and the race has tightened over the last week. While Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton remains ahead in most polls, Republican candidate Donald Trump has recently taken the lead in key swing states such as Florida and Ohio.

Our general stance on the election is largely agnostic. We are not hugely fond of either candidate. Trump certainly would be a wild-card should he be elected, while Clinton would likely remain more tied to the existing political establishment, continuing the general trajectory of most of Obama's initiatives of the last eight years.

Yet from our viewpoint, it is not so much which candidate ends up winning the election, but rather the recent polls showing Americans' negative sentiment toward both candidates which is most noteworthy.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone wp-image-865 size-full" title="clinton-trump-unfavorable-rating" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/a_clinton-trump-unforable-rating.png" alt="a_clinton-trump-unfavorable-rating" width="650" height="596" />

&nbsp;

Indeed, polls released this week show that <strong>for the first time ever, the majority of Americans view both candidates as "unfavorable".</strong> (Note: the most recent percentages are now higher than even the chart above shows, at 52.4% unfavorable rating for Clinton and 59.1% for Trump.)

The level of distrust amongst Americans toward their politicians is at an all-time high.

As a corollary, it is fascinating to note that Americans' trust of the mass media is also now at multi-decade lows. The most recent 2016 poll from Gallup shows that the percentage of Americans who have "trust and confidence" in what they are told from mainstream news outlets has fallen to just 32%.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/b_Americans-trust-mass-media-chart.png" alt="b_americans-trust-mass-media-chart" width="600" height="370" />

&nbsp;

Something unprecedented is happening here both politically and culturally. This is at least one reason to hold some physical precious metals outside the banking system, regardless of what happens to the prices in the near term.

&nbsp;

<strong>Markets and Elections</strong>

Historically speaking, since 1900 the data we have available does show that democratic Presidents correspond to better performances in the broad stock market over their terms in office, statistically higher than the performance seen with republican Presidents, as shown in the chart below.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-867" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/c_DJIA-stock-market-change-president.png" alt="c_djia-stock-market-change-president" width="1067" height="1136" />

&nbsp;

However, correlation certainly does not equal causation.

For example, the data does not take into account the myriad of other factors that could have impacted the market averages over these years, such as central bank policies, debt accumulation due to war, or the bursting of market bubbles.

The data is also only expressed in nominal terms. When inflation-adjusted or priced in gold, the data would reveal quite different results.

We also know that there are delays as new policies work their way into an economy. Could higher stock market performances in certain years came as a result of policies implemented in prior administrations?

We cannot know any of this for certain. What we can do is observe the correlation and attempt to decipher what it will mean going forward: democrats do tend to see better stock market performances during their years in office.

&nbsp;

<strong>The Election and Precious Metals</strong>

Turning our attention to precious metals and the election outcome, let us first consider the above-mentioned factor concerning higher stock prices under democratic Presidents. Because stocks and gold are often (but not always) counter-cyclical assets, broadly speaking we can surmise that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> should be expected to perform better under a republican President.

We can observe that the two most significant bull markets in precious metals over the last 50 years began under two republican Presidents: the 1971 - 1980 advance of 2,400% in gold began under republican President Nixon, and the 2001 - 2011 advance of 760% in gold began under President Bush II.

Yet we must recall that the seeds of these precious metals bull markets were sown in the years prior to the republicans taking office, as unsustainable debt and currency depreciation during the prior years eventually forced a revaluation higher in the world's ultimate monetary reserve: gold.

Again, just as we are hesitant to give sole credit to democrats for outperformance of the stock market, we cannot give sole credit to republicans for outperformance of the gold market.

&nbsp;

<strong>The Brexit Effect</strong>

In the coming election, a Trump victory would clearly be a wild-card outcome, as it is not something seen likely in current electoral polls.

Essentially, we believe most markets are siding with the polls and "pricing in" a Clinton victory.

However, markets -- and polls -- are not always correct.

As we saw in Britain with the June Brexit decision in which polls prior to the vote still hinted that the UK would not leave the EU, markets can indeed be fooled.

Since a Clinton victory is already priced in, a Trump surprise win would be a shock for most major stock and currency markets.

As such, we contend that a surprise Trump victory might cause a spike in gold similar to the $110 intraday surge seen on June 24 as votes were being tallied in Britain. Yet this time, the gold spike, should the markets get this surprise, would come not from a falling British pound, but instead from a falling US dollar and/or US stock market.

&nbsp;

<strong>How Will Americans Express Their Distrust?</strong>

No matter who ends up winning the American election on November 8, the most critical trend to follow is the general population that now distrusts <em>both</em> primary candidates and also the mainstream media.

To use the analogy of the popular game, there are not too many dominos that need to fall between the majority of Americans distrusting their government leaders, and at least a portion of those Americans deciding to vote with their wallets and to buy a modest allotment of <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> or <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>.

If you can't trust the President, and you can't trust the media, who can you trust?

It is estimated that still today, only 1% of Americans own any precious metals whatsoever.

Can we begin to fathom what would happen to prices if that percentage were to double, to say 2%? What if 10% of Americans wanted to have 10% of their net worth in gold and silver?

The fundamentals behind this sort of movement into the only asset outside of government control are as strong as they could possibly be. The key question remains timing. It is still early in this cycle. When will more people wake up?

		<title>The 2016 Walking Liberty Centennial Gold Coin - released in November</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last autumn month brings you the 3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coin - the </span><b>2016 Walking Liberty Half Dollar Centennial Gold Coin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - completing the highly anticipated </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins/us-commemorative-coins/2016-centennial"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centennial series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the US Mint. Commemorating 100 years since the coin’s first mintage, this gorgeous anniversary edition will be offered for sale on November 17</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at 12 noon ET and is expected to sell out quickly, as the previous issues of the series.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-874" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-1-2-oz-Walking-Liberty-Centennial-Gold-Coin-1916-2016-100th-Anniversary.jpg" alt="2016-1-2-oz-walking-liberty-centennial-gold-coin-1916-2016-100th-anniversary" width="800" height="700" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Celebrating 100 years of excellence in the mintage of three iconic 1916 designs, the </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/government-mints/us-mint"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Mint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued the following 2016 renditions of the highly regarded coins:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/2016-1-10-oz-mercury-dime-centennial-gold-coin-100th-anniversary-w-box-coa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury Dime Centennial Gold Coin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (April)</span></li>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/2016-1-2-oz-walking-liberty-centennial-100th-anniversary-w-box-coa"><b>The Walking Liberty Half Dollar Centennial Gold Coin</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (available on 17</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> November)</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of these highly anticipated gold collectibles are treasured additions for any numismatist due to their legendary design struck with exceptional craftsmanship by the US Mint professionals. These splendid gold coins have borrowed the original designs of the 1916 circulating coins, honoring the remarkable work of their creators and refining them with stunning business strike finishes.</span>

<img class="wp-image-878 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-1-2-oz-Walking-Liberty-Centennial-Gold-Coin-back.jpg" alt="2016-1-2-oz-walking-liberty-centennial-gold-coin-1916-2016-100th-anniversary" width="800" height="700" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the reverse and obverse sides of the coin showcase the basic design of the iconic Walking Liberty minted from 1916 to 1947 and reconstituted on the extremely popular American Silver Eagle coin, produced from 1986. The images are courtesy of the famous American sculptor, Adolph A. Weinman, whose “W” initial has been added to the coin’s head (one of the few differences between the centennial and original coins). On the obverse side is engraved the graceful full-length figure of Lady Liberty, displayed in full stride and enveloped in the United States flag’s folds. She is depicted as holding branches of laurel and oak in her left hand and having her right arm extended, encircled by the engravings “Liberty”, “In God We Trust”, and “2016”.  On the reverse side is represented the majestic American eagle which is rising from a top perch of a mountain, framed by the inscriptions “Half Dollar”, “E Pluribus Unum”, “United States of America”, along with the “W” mintmark, purity and weight of the coin (another unique feature of the anniversary edition).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This astonishing coin will be re-struck at the US Mint West Point Facility from ½ troy ounce of 99.99% pure (24 Karat) gold and will come with business strike finish and reeded edge. The half-ounce size is representative to the centennial coin’s denomination of half a dollar. The 2016 Walking Liberty Half Dollar Centennial Gold Coin has a limited mintage of just 70,000 pieces (lower than the limits for the previous centennial coin issues) and a 3-coin household order limit. Each coin will be individually encapsulated and displayed by the mint in a hand-packed and custom-designed elegant black matte hardwood presentation case which will contain the coin’s Certificate of Authenticity.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-879" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-half-oz-Walking-Liberty-Centennial-Gold-Coin-with-Box.jpg" alt="2016-half-oz-walking-liberty-centennial-gold-coin-with-box" width="800" height="700" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first centennial edition – the 2016 Mercury Dime Gold Coin – sold out in less than one hour and the mint offers only a few of the 2016 Standing Liberty Quarter Centennial Gold Coins. The low issue of the centennial Walking Liberty promises that this thrilling coin will also be a sought-after keepsake, so don’t miss your chance to own the last issue of the series.</span>

		<title><![CDATA[Gold & Silver Technical Updates. The Presidential Election]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[With no change announced to interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve meeting this week, the markets instead focused mostly on the upcoming <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/10/31/americans-wary-candidates-how-will-markets-respond/">US election</a>. Polls continued to show the gap between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton narrowing, now to 1.6%. The correlation between gold and Trump's poll odds has been striking over the last two weeks... and one way or another, the question as to who will lead the United States for the next four years will be decided this Tuesday.
<h2>Gold</h2>
In sum, gold rose this week by $27 to close at $1,304, a gain of 2.2% from a week prior.

As emotions can become extreme at such critical fundamental crossroads, we find it useful to return our attention at these moments to the charts for what is always the primary driver for the entire precious metals complex: the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">price of gold</a>.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-887" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Gold-price-elections.png" alt="gold-price-elections" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

The language of the charts shows us that gold is now directly hitting up against the upper boundary of the broken support zone which held it higher from June through early October, at $1,305.

It would be rare for a market to break down from such a support zone (as happened in October) and then recover it on the first attempt higher, so we would expect to see gold back off in this region, and spend more weeks consolidating between the support established in at $1,245 and the recent high of $1,305. This would then set gold up to make a second attempt to break $1,305 later this year or early 2017. This is what markets "should" do from a technical perspective.

However, a Trump victory would certainly be one of those fundamental triggers that could cause a major breakout on the chart pattern prior to our typical expectation.

For now, we will have to step back and watch the outcome this week. The trading on Tuesday should be fascinating to observe. Whether it is sooner or later, the support and resistance zones that will define the next stages of gold's trajectory are clearly defined, and the most important question we continue to monitor is: "When will gold break its long-term downtrend?"

That break is going to coincide with a fundamental spark that will reveal itself just at the right time. Again, the charts can give us great insight into "what" is happening... the "why" always remains to be seen.

&nbsp;
<h2>Silver</h2>
Silver finished higher for the week by $0.58 cents to close at $18.37, a gain of 3.2%, although well off the high of $18.75 hit on Wednesday.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-888" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Silver-price-elections.png" alt="silver-price-elections" width="1240" height="928" />

&nbsp;

As we can see above, silver got stopped in its tracks just above $18.50, the former support seen in late August. From a technical perspective over the short term, $18.50 matches very closely with the $1,305 resistance in gold. A break and sustained close of either of these levels by either metal would give us a strong indication of a breakout to come in the other.

Strong support for <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver price</a> exists between $17.00 and $17.40.

The critical test for silver is that we observe when it breaks the downtrend shown above in blue. We continue to believe <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> will break this trend line within the same timeframe as gold's break of its long-term downtrend (magenta color, page 1).

<strong> </strong>

<strong>A Note on the Fed Statement</strong>

As referenced above, the Fed meeting was generally a non-event this week. However, the language used by the Fed in the non-decision strongly hinted that a second rate hike is due to come, perhaps as early as December:

"<em>Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. </em><strong><em>The Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives</em></strong><em>. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."</em>

This point bears repeating, as the misinformation from the mainstream media is constant and is repeated in almost every major Fed interest rate article: throughout history rising interest rates have corresponded with rising gold prices, not the opposite, as the mainstream press often states.

What we are now witnessing is the very beginning of the <u>slowest</u> rate-hike cycle the Fed has ever engaged in.

Typically over the last 70 years during rate hike cycles, the Fed would raise 0.25% every meeting over the course of 3-5 years. Such was the case, for example, from 2003-2007 as the Fed raised rates from 1% to 5.25% in 0.25% increments, every 6-12 weeks.

Yet during the current cycle, the Fed has raised rates only <u>once</u>, and it has now paused for a full year since that singular rate hike in December 2015. This is the only time in history the Fed has raised rates once, and then paused for the next year. We are witnessing a slow-motion collision course between unsustainable debt levels that cannot afford higher interest rates, and a wave of inflation that is already working its way into various segments of the economy.

Newton's Third Law says: "For every action there is an opposite and equal reaction." The unprecedented interest rate policy we are living through is going to have unprecedented consequences, it is only a question of timing.

		<title><![CDATA[Trump's Unexpected Victory, Markets Reverse Course]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Donald Trump clinched an unexpected victory for the US Presidential election on Tuesday, which sent major world markets into a temporary panic.  Gold surged, stocks dropped limit-down in the overnight hours, and it appeared gold was on the verge of the technical breakout from the long-term downtrend that we have been monitoring for almost half a year now.

Yet just 12 hours after the election results became known, the markets saw quick reversals of the prior movements, with precious metals and other safety assets being dumped, and risk assets including broad stocks and industrial commodities being bought strongly.

We remain long-term bullish on precious metals for the fundamental reasons that we all know to be true: central bank money printing, government bailouts of private corporations, uncontrollable debt, and negative interest rates in several major nations worldwide.

Yet the challenge at this moment is to come back to a central investment principle: do not fight the market.

What this means is that, as individuals and investors, we may have opinions on what the market should do. We may have fundamental data from sound research to back up those opinions. We may have done thorough due diligence. Yet despite all this, if the market moves opposite to our fundamental research, we must consider that there is more information impacting the market than we are factoring into our equations.

The old investment adage is helpful to remember: "The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."
<h2>Markets Turn After Trump's Victory</h2>
Immediately in the aftermath of the Trump election victory, most major world markets reversed course abruptly and strongly.

Gold and silver, which were up significantly in the hours after Trump's win was decided, reversed suddenly and finished lower for the week. Gold hit a high of $1,335 in the early morning hours on Wednesday, only to close the week near $1,225, almost a $110 drop in just over 48 hours.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-903" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a_TrumpVictory-stocks-dollar-gold-silver.jpg" alt="trump-victory-stocks-dollar-gold-silver" width="1500" height="1125" />

&nbsp;

Similarly, the US dollar and the US stock market, which were showing 2.5% and 5% losses in the overnight hours after the election, reversed course and both finished higher by over 1%, respectively. These are notable intra-week swings.

But it was not only gold and precious metals that fell after the initial surge on Tuesday night. Long-term 20+ year US bonds also dropped, falling over 6% in the last three trading days of the week. This is a huge drop for the bond market, to the extent that 20-year interest rates rose from 2.26% to 2.58% in just one week. This is one of the largest single-week drops in bond prices / increase in bond interest rates seen in the last 20 years.

In sum, after the initial fear reaction as a result of Trump's victory, most major markets did a 180-degree turn and reversed. Safety assets were sold across the board, and risk assets recovered to turn positive.

Let us switch the above chart to view the action in metals only. We are including both precious and industrial metals in the following chart.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-904" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b_Trump-Victory-precious-Metals.jpg" alt="trump-victory-precious-metals" width="1500" height="1125" />

&nbsp;

First, we see that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-copper">copper</a> was the outstanding performer this week, indicating demand for the industrial metals was seen as positive after the Trump election. <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">Palladium</a> came in second, which is, of course, a precious metal with major industrial demand, especially from the automotive industry.

In contrast, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> all fell, the first two being the historic monetary metals.

It appears that markets are pricing in increased industrial demand from the Trump administration and a lesser need for safety assets. We can only speculate as to the reasons for this -- we wonder (half-jokingly): is the wall that Trump intends to build along the US-Mexico border going to be made primarily of copper?

Silver is the outlier. As we know, silver's demand equation still is composed of roughly 80% industrial usage. Why did silver fall more than gold, and not finish the week somewhere in between gold and copper (as it "should" when safety assets fall but industrial assets rise)? What happened to the industrial silver buyers?

Manipulation theories aside (we do not completely discount them, but do not consider them sufficient for making investment decisions), based on the declines seen in US bonds, gold, and platinum, we can only conclude that silver saw large selling from those who were previously holding the metal for its safety / monetary role. We may not agree with their decision to sell, but sell is what they did.

A quick view of the copper chart from 2010 through present reveals the significance of the surge seen in the primary-industrial metal this week: no less than a breakout from the long-term declining trendline since the 2011 highs. [Note: this is the same relative trendline that has been so elusive for gold, from which it has failed to break higher for the past five months. From the copper surge seen this week it should be apparent why we place emphasis on the potential breaking of these long-term trends.]

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-905" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/c_Copper-spot-price-elections.png" alt="copper-spot-price-elections" width="1067" height="799" />

&nbsp;

In sum, copper was up an incredible 10.7% for the week and looks like it is entering a new bull market after five years of declines.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold Analysis</h2>
For the week, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price per ounce</a> fell $80 or 6.1% to finish at $1,224. Yet more significant was the nearly $110 swing from $1,335 on Wednesday to the Friday close.

<strong>The Wednesday reversal consisted of the highest ever single-day volume of contracts traded on the New York COMEX exchange, at 780,000.</strong> This is nearly four times the average daily volume.

Because this historic volume occurred on a reversal day, the $1,335 high is going to require multiple attempts or an equally-high record-breaking volume surge to break through this level on any subsequent rally.

Viewing gold technically, the metal is making a lower low within the strong support zone that we would expect to hold if gold is still in a new bull market. This zone extends down to $1,200, precisely.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-906" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/d_gold-spot-price-elections.png" alt="d_gold-spot-price-elections" width="1125" height="843" />

&nbsp;

The "Must Hold Zone", as defined by $1,173, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the advance, would be the lowest level that we have observed new bull markets to fall while still being in a primary overall advance. A break below that level and quick retests of $1,045 would occur at minimum.

		<title>Dollar Surges, Bonds Fall in Trump Aftermath</title>
		<content><![CDATA[In the wake of the Trump election, the US dollar has broken out higher from the two-year consolidation that we have been watching now for many months. Held between the 92 support level and the 100 resistance zone since the beginning of 2015, the dollar hit a high of 101.5 last week, decisively breaking through the aforementioned resistance.

This is important to monitor because over the short and intermediate-term, the precious metals often move counter to the value of the US dollar. (Over the long run, we can clearly observe that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is rising regardless of fluctuations in the US dollar versus other world currencies. More on this below.)

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-914" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a_US-Dollar-index.png" alt="us-dollar-index" width="1055" height="627" />

&nbsp;

The target for a successful breakout of this nature is derived as equal to the amplitude of the prior consolidation. The fundamental reason for this target is that an equal number of trapped short-sellers who placed their bets during the consolidation are likely to cover their shorts as the breakout advances, thus driving the dollar higher. The prior consolidation featured an 8 point amplitude (100 - 92). Thus, we expect the US dollar to advance to approximately 108 on the index over the next 6-12 months.

If <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> were to fall below $1,200 and toward the 2015 lows of $1,045 again, it would be because paper traders are reacting to this advance now setting up in the dollar.

Longer term, let us never forget that an attempt to determine what the price of gold will be at a given value of the US dollar versus other depreciating currencies is akin to trying to decide which ship is best to stay on amidst the certainty that all ships will sink during an approaching typhoon.

The truth is: all ships will be sinking, just at different rates. Gold is the life raft.

The proof for this can be seen in the long-term view of the <strong>US dollar index versus gold</strong>, where we update the levels at which gold has traded corresponding to the 100 point on the dollar index. Note that since 1980, gold has traded at $700, $275, $375, and $1,200 all while the US dollar has essentially made a round trip back to 100.

As the mainstream media continuously attempts to discredit gold based on movements in the dollar index, it is important that we keep this long-term perspective in mind at all times.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-915" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b_USDGold.png" alt="gold-usd-index" width="1080" height="951" />
<h2>Bond Selling Continues After Trump Victory</h2>
US bonds continue to see major selling since Trump's victory, to the extent that the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond has seen its interest rate rise from 2.55% to 3.01% since the election.

We have long speculated that the final top to the unprecedented 36-year advance in US bonds was nearing an end. Yet bull markets typically end with a bang and not a whimper, and this backdrop usually takes the form of a bubble during the later stages. Bubbles can be spotted on the charts as a multi-year linear advance becomes parabolic during its later stages.

The selling seen over the last two weeks in the bond market brings this idea to the forefront, as bond prices have hit 152, just touching the parabolic curve (blue on the chart below) that we believe is setting up to mark the bubble-like end of this long-term advance.

The only question is: do bond prices have one final surge higher to go to mark a true mania phase in US paper, or has the top already been put into place?

The two trajectories, one envisioning a final blow-off phase for bonds and one assuming that the top has already been put into place, are outlined in green below.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-916" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/c_US-Bond-price-november-2016.png" alt="us-bond-price-november-2016" width="1064" height="632" />
A determining characteristic of bubbles is that they go on longer and higher than almost anyone can fathom, so whether the final top was just put into place, or whether there needs to be one final surge to new all-time highs in bond prices remains to be seen. What we can say is that most people alive today have never seen a bear market in bond prices during their investment careers -- and now after 36 years of rising, it is equally fathomable that bond prices could see 36 years of selling. The ramifications of this are unimaginable, but due to unprecedented debt levels worldwide, most governments could not withstand interest rates above 5%, let alone rates near 14% or 15%, as were seen during the 1970's and 1980's.

Will governments insist that central banks be their buyers of last resort as legitimate demand for bonds falls in the coming years?

The only source of funding that central banks have for this is the printing press (i.e. electronic equivalent). Future gold prices will thus be largely impacted by the bursting of the bond bubble.

----------

Thursday, November 24 is Thanksgiving here in the United States. Major markets will be closed. There will be a half-day (until 1:00pm) of trading on Friday. In sum, markets should be rather slow starting Wednesday afternoon through the end of the week.

Happy Thanksgiving and enjoy the long weekend ahead!

		<title>Gold: Looking for Double Bottom?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[Let us be very clear: we are bullish on precious metals over the long term. Yet over the intermediate timeframe, the market is giving us signals that the long-term bottoms we are expecting to form may take a more complex path than was originally anticipated. We should stay nimble and be prepared for some twists and turns going forward.

For the last week, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> fell by $30 to close at $1,183 as of the NY COMEX final print, a 2.4% loss for the week. Notably, the low for the week came late Thursday night EST / early Friday morning in Asia, at near $1,171, before bouncing, touching the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement line of the entire December through July advance, and the final "Must Hold" support zone that we have been monitoring for some months.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-938" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a_Gold-price-november-2016.png" alt="gold-price-november-2016" width="1195" height="895" />

&nbsp;

If <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is going to put in a low in this region, it must immediately rise this week above the $1,200 level and maintain a weekly close there. This would turn the break below the $1,200 level into a "false breakdown", and would require us to re-examine the possibility that the next advance is indeed underway. Such fake-outs do occur in all markets periodically, and the only way to identify them is to maintain a close watch of the key support/resistance levels. This is the only scenario in which we could consider the initial advance from 2015 to still be continuing.

However, the bulk of the evidence now in front of us leads to the conclusion that gold will need to at least retest the region of its 2015 lows, if not break below them, as part of a more complex multi-year bottoming formation.

The support below $1,173 is negligible for gold, down to the 2015 lows. Strong support levels are primarily defined by prior periods of consolidative action, and in the case of gold that consolidation took place between $1,200 and $1,305 from February to June. The fact that gold saw little to no buying interest at $1,200 last week indicates those buyers who bought the dips toward $1,200 last spring are no longer participating in the market.

Why are they no longer present? We cannot know. Those buyers were a diverse group of institutions, individuals, and funds from around the world, so we cannot possibly identify a single cause for their sum lack of participation. All we can know is what they (the market) are doing, and align ourselves for the highest probability of success.

Below $1,173, we will next look for a bottom in gold indicated by the new green shading on the chart above, which corresponds to the consolidation seen from November 2015 through early January 2016. This zone of $1,045 - $1,085 is where we would look for the possibility of gold to form a double bottom. The term double bottom is derived precisely because the price reached this level once before, and then comes back to retest (if successful) this level for a second time.

&nbsp;

<strong>Technical Clues for the Next Bottom</strong>

No matter what the exact low price that forms for gold, we will be looking for a specific set of bottoming patterns to come into play. One of the most important bottom indicators will be to watch for a period of outperformance of the mining sector versus the metal itself. As an example, if gold were to fall to $1,045 again, we should expect to see the mining complex bottom several points above its related 2015 lows, as measured either by either the HUI or GDX index.

We will also be looking for a downtrend break in gold, as well as any other number of confirming bottoming patterns: bottoming wedge, inverse head and shoulders, gold outperformance versus CRB commodity index, etc.

These are the bottoming indicators that worked in 2008 as well as 2015, and at least several of them will allow us to target the next bottom as it approaches. Of course, we will not catch the exact bottom to the day -- but the truth is no one will. We will, however, be able to observe the shift in the market for what should be a move equal to, if not greater than, the 2016 initial advance.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>1999 - 2001 Gold Example</strong>

As an example, here is how the last long-term bottom in gold formed, from 1999 - 2001. The pattern featured a support zone between $250 and $265, with an initial advance to $337, a 34% surge that gave back almost all of its gains into the double bottom of 2001. Downtrend breaks were noted in successive fashion in November 2000 and then again in May 2001.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b_Gold-1999-2001-double-bottom.png" alt="gold-1999-2001-double-bottom" width="1177" height="857" />

&nbsp;

For long-term investors, any purchases within the 1999 - 2001 period, even at the $337 peak, were eventually seen to be excellent value once the price of gold exceeded the initial advance in 2002. It then never looked back.

Of course, no two periods in history will match exactly, but the point is that a set of potential patterns exist which tend to define most bottoms, and we fully expect to identify the next one to come.

&nbsp;

<strong>Gold: Looking Forward</strong>

As a working hypothesis, with the expectation of a double bottom to form in gold, we propose the following trajectory for gold over the subsequent two years:

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-940" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/c_Gold-2009-downtrend.png" alt="gold-2009-downtrend" width="1208" height="904" />

&nbsp;

The primary 2013 - 2015 downtrend channel for gold, which was broken in February and shown in light blue, would be set up to act as a second support level for gold near the $1,045 double bottom.

A successful double bottom would then set up gold to challenge its long-term (magenta color) downtrend again in late 2017, with the expectation of a successful breakout either then or in early 2018. By this time, the downtrend would come in much lower, near $1,200. Yet its significance would be no less.

For comparison, we continue to monitor the incredible action taking place in the copper market over the last month. In just four weeks, <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">copper</a> has surged 28% to $2.67 per pound.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-941" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/d_Copper-2010-2016.png" alt="copper-2010-2016" width="1203" height="900" />

&nbsp;

A similar 28% percentage gain, should gold break its long-term downtrend next year at $1,200, would result in a surge to $1,536 within four weeks. Such is the type of move we want to be positioned for ahead of time.

		<title>Deutsche Bank Settles in Gold-Fixing Lawsuit</title>
		<content><![CDATA[On Friday, Deutsche Bank agreed to settle privately for antitrust litigation brought against the German bank by traders and investors who accused the company of conspiring to fix <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold prices</a> at their expense.

This case holds special interest to me personally, as I was contacted by the prosecuting counsel and gave testimony to some of the dubious trading patterns I have observed over the years participating in the futures market.

<img class="size-full wp-image-961 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Deutsche-Bank-Gold-Dold-Settlement.jpg" alt="deutsche-bank-gold-settlement" width="600" height="300" />

The preliminary settlement was filed in New York this week, and consists of a $60M package.

This follows a similar settlement the bank agreed to pay in October of $38M for conspiring to fix <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver prices</a>.

It still remains to be seen which classes of traders or investors are eligible to receive compensation from the settlement, and the total payout per individual is unlikely to amount to more than a few hundred dollars.

Further, it should be noted that the combined settlements of $98M represent a tiny fraction of the bank's $47 billion revenue for 2015. So the settlement will have negligible impact on the company.

Deutsche Bank officially denies wrongdoing. However, the fact that the bank is willing to settle the case is unprecedented in and of itself. Here we have, for the first time, a large multi-national bank agreeing to settle for actions related to manipulation of the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/category/precious-metals-investing/">precious metals markets</a>.

With this settlement, it is possible that further class action lawsuits could be brought against Deutsche Bank by other parties in coming years.

Four other banks who were also listed as defendants in the case have not agreed to settle yet: Barclays, Bank of Nova Scotia, HSBC, and Societe Generale. Should the case go to trial, a ruling against these banks could result in much harsher penalties than the $98M Deutsche Bank is paying?

&nbsp;

<strong>Manipulation Theories Go Mainstream</strong>

In years past, theories that banks were attempting to manipulate <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">precious metals prices</a> were considered the realm of conspiracy theorists and dismissed by the mainstream media.

However, it is increasingly clear that the precious metals markets represent a special focal point for many institutions, and attempts to manipulate their values are indeed occurring.

It has long been my contention that such manipulation attempts do occur. However, I also believe that such attempts are not more powerful than the market forces itself. Ultimately, the market will win out, and attempts at suppression will fail. This is a lesson from countless examples throughout history: attempts to suppress a given market only result in that market moving higher once the suppression is overwhelmed.

No matter whether the market action on a given day or week is related to manipulative attempts or to legitimate buying and selling, we should still pay attention to where price signals appear on the charts. Both manipulation and legitimate market action do impact the prices at which we must buy and sell physical metal, as well as the revenues and hence market valuations of the companies that mine for the metals in the ground.

Over the long run, we should not want to be involved with the precious metals if they could be manipulated ad infinitum. The fact that we as investors are here means we must have faith that such suppression will fail and the market forces will seek true values.

Over the next few months, we will continue to monitor the settlement and litigation proceedings of these cases, and report on any actions that individual investors should take on the possibility of reparation payments.

<h2>Italians Vote "No" -- Signals Establishment Discontent</h2>
Early Monday morning, we received reports that Italians have voted "no" on Premier Matteo Renzi's reform referendum, and further reports that Renzi will resign on Monday.

The outcome is generally seen as representing a victory for "anti-establishment" voters. The reform referendum was strongly backed by Italy's corporations, banks, and establishment institutions, so the defeat sends a message that is similar in context to Britain's Brexit vote and Trump's victory here in the US.

<img class="size-full wp-image-962 aligncenter" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Italians-Vote-No-Signals-Establishment-Discontent.jpg" alt="italians-vote-no-signals-establishment-discontent" width="600" height="300" />

Here we see over the last six months three major western nations delivering strong anti-establishment and anti-globalist messages to their politicians.

While the impact to the precious metals markets have been minor in the overnight Asian trading immediately following the vote, clearly, the "wind of change" that is blowing in various corners of the political world is gaining in momentum...

&nbsp;

<strong>A Political to Economic Trend?</strong>

From a dual political/economic standpoint, we cannot help but wonder: when will even a small fraction of those discontented with the current system (and willing to vote against it in an election) connect the dots and vote against the same system even more tangibly by selling the local currency and <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">buying gold</a> / <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silve</a> instead? It would not take many of the world's discontented citizens to simply buy a few ounces of silver or a single ounce of gold for the prices to skyrocket to multiples of the current level.

The timing for this scenario remains speculative still, but we can indeed see shifts in sentiment in front of our eyes. One thing is for sure: political systems and their fiat currencies are intrinsically related... and no amount of manipulation from Deutsche Bank or any other institution will be able to hold back the "voting" of the global currency market when it finally moves in favor of gold.

		<title>Gold and Silver Technical Updates. Long-term double bottom scenarios</title>
		<content><![CDATA[Having fallen for five weeks straight since the Trump victory, gold this week broke through its final technical support of the 2016 advance, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the entire surge, at $1,173, so we must now shift our focus toward identifying the next low that is set to come. For the week, gold fell 1.4% to close at $1,159 as of the final electronic trade in New York on Friday.

The intermediate-term 3-year chart is the most helpful perspective at this juncture:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/a_Gold-december-2016.png" alt="gold-price-december-2016" width="1201" height="899" />

&nbsp;

Two weeks ago, we highlighted the example of the 1999-2001 double bottom for gold, and how this might look should the same pattern play out again, 16 years later. Having seen the continued weakness in gold over the last two weeks, let us now focus on some additional specifics.

The 2013 - 2015 downtrend channel, seemingly forgotten last summer, is the next potential whereby gold should attempt to begin carving out a double bottom. For reference, the channel was formed by five separate hits each on the upper and lower trendlines from 2013 onward, as shown above by the red and orange highlight circles on the chart. It was as clear of a trend channel as we could possibly ask for -- and it was broken in February 2016 as gold exceeded $1,190.

Since that trend channel was indeed declining, even though gold has now come back below the $1,190 breakout point, the precious metal still finds itself above the upper boundary of the channel.

Markets often come back to re-test broken lines and channels, and in this case <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> looks to be setting up for that retest within the next 3-4 months.

The retest of the trend channel should correspond, plus or minus a few percentage points, with the low for the 2015 bottom, at $1,045. Typically in long-term double bottom scenarios, the second low will fail to reach the depths of the initial low by several percentage points. <strong>Thus, our <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/11/28/gold-double-bottom/">double bottom</a> potential exists from $1,045 through $1,080, </strong>as shown by the green band above. The possibility of a nominal new low in gold forming alongside a double bottom in the gold mining sector should also not be ruled out.
<h2>Silver Update</h2>
Silver finished the week positive for the second week in a row, up $0.13 or 0.80% to close at $16.97 as of the final COMEX trade in New York.

This was the second week in a row that <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver spot price</a> has moved in an opposite direction as gold when viewing the weekly closing prices. Silver outperformance should be noted to be positive relative strength, which has ramifications for the entire sector, and fitting in with our thesis that a complex long-term bottom is forming in the precious metals, even if the absolute lows remain ahead of us.

The rally this week was halted exactly at the broken support-turned-resistance zone shown below by the black line at $17.25. A break above this $17.25 resistance would hint that a short-term bottom is in the process of forming, although we will feel much more comfortable that the larger decline is over when the upper blue downtrend line is broken, which now comes in at $18.45.

		<title>Gold to Silver Ratio Analysis</title>
		<content><![CDATA[As shown on the chart below, the defining characteristic of the decline in gold and silver prices since the July/August highs has been the rising trend in the gold to silver ratio.

Of course, this ratio measures the number of <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">ounces of silver</a> needed to purchase one <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">ounce of gold</a>.

The fall in the gold/silver ratio from above 80 in January to 64 in early July corresponded to the advances in both metals with outperformance by silver. However, the rise in the gold/silver ratio since July from 64 to 68 as both metals have declined has shown only marginal outperformance by gold.

In other words, as a sum, since the beginning of the year, silver has outperformed gold when viewing the entirety of the advance and subsequent retracement.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/gold-silver-ratio-2016.png" alt="gold-silver-ratio-2016" width="1206" height="717" />

&nbsp;

<strong>Silver's 2016 Outperformance in Perspective</strong>

The major gold/silver ratio trend breakdown in April (first red highlight circle) was a defining change in the ongoing pattern, after nearly five years of rising in favor of gold (large turquoise channel).

The initial wave lower in the gold/silver ratio (corresponding with rising metals prices) lasted through September. While this initial wave lower was halted at the end of September, we do not expect the former 2011 - 2016 rising channel to be regained again.

In other words: silver outperformance is likely over a multi-year period ahead, even though it will underperform gold during sometimes lengthy corrections.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Different Strategies for Different Investors</strong>

Of course, each precious metals investor comes to the sector with a different set of goals, a different time horizon, and a different tolerance for risk. Whereas long-term investors may find dollar-cost averaging into the lows to be a helpful strategy, those with a shorter-term time horizon may want to focus on following some of these technical indicators along with us.

Those wanting to hold <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> as "wealth insurance" in case of political or economic turmoil are reminded that the best time to buy an insurance policy is not when it has gone up in price, but when it has come down. And those insurance policies are now some $200 cheaper per ounce than they were in mid-summer.]]></content>

		<title>How a change in Sharia Law can increase a demand for gold?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The prospect of the precious metals market could set an absolutely new path in December 2016 because of the new “Gold standard” in the Sharia law. The financial and personal lives of Muslims are guided by Sharia law, which doesn’t allow to trade gold for the future value, interests or speculation. The gold as a ribawi item can be sold only on weight and measure and used as a jewelry, but not as a prosperity. However, there has been a need for clarification for how gold bullion can be used for investment purposes by Muslims for a long time. Islamic investors have always had access to the gold market through jewelry and coins, this guidance will vastly increase the number and diversity of investment products available.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The possibility of many potential Muslim investors has been limited because this law and it could be a revolutionary change for the precious metals market if the Sharia gold standard will be developed. This upcoming clarification could open the gold market to millions Muslims under Sharia law and also causes a further spike in <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically Islamic financial market has had an important international influence, even the investors have had access to the gold market only through jewelry and coins, this change will let Muslim market become much more powerful. For this reason, it is not a surprise, that, the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) and the World Gold Council have approved a ground-breaking initiative, that will become known as the</span><b> “Sharia Gold Standard”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Islamic world will play an increasingly important role for the gold price demand, which has been structured by Western ideas for a long time. Most people don’t realize how rare gold really is, but the fact is there are only 6.4 billion ounces of aboveground gold on the planet, so millions of the potential new buyers can bring a lot of competition to the market game. Muslim investors will be able to take an advantage of the increasing back of range and bring a lot of competition into the investment world.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sharia-law-gold.jpg" alt="sharia law gold" width="342" height="328" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the global reports in 2015 China was the largest gold buyer (average number of sold gold is 1,000 tons). Since gold has a long history with Muslims -- as a currency and store of wealth -- it's expected Muslim investors will quickly embrace gold investment products such as coins, bars and include gold savings plans, gold certificates, certain gold futures and gold mining stocks in their financial goals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This new law would set a future path for gold products and put a real pressure on metals as they would become more expensive. Due to the general economy situation in the world the most banks have added gold to their reserves since the financial crisis of 2007/2008. But currently there are still two Muslim countries (Turkey and Saudi Arabia) that included in the top 20 of the world’s gold reserve holdings and they will definitely try to get as much value as they can for their fund.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment analytics all around the world announce that it’s not unreasonable to expect a good bump up in the gold prices as soon as Wall Street prepares for the annual Federal Reserve meeting. These last weeks are considered to be very intense and changing for industrial metals dynamic. For this reason, we here at Bullion Exchanges believe this is a really great time to add value to your profitable precious metals portfolio and buy old before it will be additionally appealing on the Muslim market. We offer a great selection of </span><a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold products</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including the latest 2017 releases at low prices.

		<title>Gold in Foreign Currencies - Clues to Gold in US Dollars</title>
		<content><![CDATA[Given the potential for the pending low we are expecting across the precious metals in the next 2-3 months, it is important that we review gold priced in other major world currencies at this juncture.

If gold is going to form a bottom in US dollars, it is going to form concurrent bottoms at different but related key technical zones in other currencies during the same timeframe.

Conversely, if we observe major breakdowns in key technical levels in gold as priced in foreign currencies, it would give us clues that US dollar gold may be heading for new lows.

Although <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold priced in US dollars</a> is the worldwide standard for both trade and mining valuation, the bull market that we are expecting over the coming years is believed to be a worldwide phenomenon. Whereas in the 1970's gold's advance was mostly related to US dollar weakness after President Nixon severed the link to gold, today every currency in the world is fiat, and we have observed the precious metal moving higher over the last decade in multiple currencies.

This situation of not having a single currency backed by <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, in and of itself, is unprecedented, and so we now turn to gold as priced in four other major currencies for perspective on the faith (or lack thereof) other western citizens are placing in their own central bank's regimes.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold in Canadian Dollars (CAD)</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1042 size-full" title="Gold in Canadian Dollars (CAD)" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/a_Gold-in-Canadian-Dollars-CAD.png" alt="a_Gold in Canadian Dollars (CAD)" width="1223" height="727" />

Gold in Canadian dollars hit a high of just over $1,800 over in the summer, with a second attempt to break this level negated following Trump's victory.

Canadian dollar-gold has since given back nearly $300 to close just above $1,515 this week.

The critical technical position of gold in Canadian dollars is evident on the chart above by the long-term (magenta color) trendline that is now being tested. This test represents the second distinct hit on the trendline since breaking the 2011-2014 downtrend in mid-2014 (red callout, above). This trendline dates all the way back to 2005.

We can observe a fairly uniform rising channel having formed since CAD gold bottomed in 2013 at $1,250, with four successive higher highs and four successive higher lows since then.

If gold were to break down through the long-term trendline, it would give us reason for additional caution on US dollar gold.

If gold in US dollars is going to form the interim low we expect in early 2017, gold in Canadian dollars should hold its long-term rising trendline immediately and exceed $1,800 by 2018.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold in British Pounds (GBP)</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1043" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/b_Gold-in-British-Pounds-GBP.png" alt="Gold in British Pounds (GBP)" width="1204" height="715" />

Gold in British pounds had bottomed at £700 in late 2015, before the 2016 advance reached over £1,050 post-Brexit. Since the US election, British pound-gold has given back £150 to close just above £900.

Gold in pounds is now retesting its Brexit breakout point at £900. This is the price below which the metal consolidated for most of 2016 prior to the vote.

From a technical perspective, we would expect to see second-chance buyers in the UK step in between £850 - £900 for an interim low.

If gold in US dollars is to form a double bottom in 2017 and then begin a new bull market, we expect, based on the ongoing weakness across pound sterling exchange rates, that gold in GBP will make new all-time highs as early as 2018.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold in Euros (EUR)</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1044" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/c_Gold-in-Euros-EUR.png" alt="Gold in Euros (EUR)" width="1208" height="718" />

Gold in euros bears many similarities in trajectory to gold in Canadian dollars, yet with the swings in each direction since 2013 showing lesser volatility. Euro-gold bottomed in 2013 at just above €860, broke its downtrend from the 2012 high in January 2016, and has since formed a rising trend channel similar to that seen in CAD gold.

Since hitting €1,250 in July, euro-gold has come back into the middle of its rising trend channel just below €1,100. We will want to see this long-term (magenta color) lower trendline hold for an interim low, with a higher high to form sequentially by 2018 above €1,250.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gold in Australian Dollars (AUD)</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1045" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/d_Gold-in-Australian-Dollars-AUD.png" alt="Gold in Australian Dollars (AUD)" width="1202" height="715" />

Gold as priced in Australian dollars is unique in that the price actually broke down in early 2013 from its long-term rising trendline, shown by the red highlight. Since then, AUD gold has formed a cup consolidation, retesting the 2011 high at $1,800 last summer.

<img class="alignright wp-image-1046" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/e_AUD-gold-Cup-Handle.png" alt="AUD gold Cup Handle" width="437" height="387" />

Notably, AUD gold has failed to regain the broken trendline on five separate occasions since 2013 (red arrows). In technical analysis, broken support often becomes resistance, even in a trending market.

Yet the decline from the recent high down to $1,550 still fits in with the model of a consolidation. In this model, we are looking at a cup and handle continuation pattern, which, as shown in textbook example to the right, is derived from a tea cup setting of the same name.

Should AUD gold make a new all-time high above $1,800, it would be an early-warning signal that gold in other western currencies may be headed in that direction within a few years. (It is quite possible for a long-term trendline to break as it has for AUD gold, but for the market to continue on to new highs, albeit at a lesser rate of acceleration.)

A break below the $1,300 level would indicate the likelihood of a long-term double top at $1,800.

At present, the action between $1,300 and $1,800 must be viewed as consolidative in nature until one of those levels is broken.

		<title><![CDATA[Gold & Silver Approaching Interim Lows]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[2016 has been one of the most volatile years on record for gold: the best first-half performance in 40 years, followed by the ongoing retracement that has seen the bulk of the gains for the metal itself given back.

These moves have left many wondering if this was just a "false rally" in the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">price of gold</a> on the way to a continuation of the 2011-2015 bear market. And while no one can ever say with 100% certainty what the future will bring, with a clear technical view of the markets we are now in the best possible position to capture the moves that lie ahead when they do indeed materialize.

As there are still four trading days left in the year, we will wait until next week to offer a full 2016 year-end review of the precious metals markets and a look ahead for 2017.
<h3>Gold Analysis</h3>
Turning to spot gold itself, the pre-Christmas week featured relatively light trading, with prices finishing at $1,133 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX. Such represents a loss of $3.80 or 0.3% from a week prior.

Notably, this was the seventh weekly loss for gold in a row, the longest such stretch since May 2004. This is an interesting statistic to contemplate. Consider, for instance, that <strong>the last time gold fell for so many weeks in a row was during the early stages of the 2001 - 2011 bull market, </strong>not during a bear market. It is often said that the most severe (percentage per time unit) declines happen during bull markets, as prices must climb a "wall of worry". Will this hold true again? We will know shortly.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1056 size-full" title="Gold-2013-2016" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/a_Gold-2013-2016.png" alt="Gold-2013-2016" width="1205" height="902" />

&nbsp;

Technically, gold is now within sight of the declining broken 2013 - 2015 trend channel we have been monitoring for several weeks, shown in blue above. If the price were to use the broken trendline as support this week, the level to watch for a bounce would be $1,100 precisely. Such a rebound would indicate the potential for a higher-low to form in gold than in 2015. The 2015 bottom zone is labeled by the green band above as between $1,045 - $1,080.

We would place a stronger trust in the low if it were to form as a confluence of the broken blue trendline and the $1,045 - $1,080 support zone. For those two regions to overlap, the bottom would need to wait for the trendline to decline from its current reading at $1,100. Based on the slope of the line, that convergence would happen between February and May of the coming year.

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> is still largely oversold on the daily RSI indicator (red circle, top of chart) below the 30 level, a reading which has corresponded with previous medium-term lows over the past 18 months.

In sum, a short-term bounce should be expected at any moment in gold; however, long-term bottom signals require several converging technical patterns, for which we are still waiting across both the metal and the mining complex.
<h3>Silver Analysis</h3>
<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver spot price</a> fell further than gold again this week, giving up the relative outperformance we had noted during late November and early December versus gold. For the week, silver declined 2.8% or $0.46 cents, to close at $15.76 as of the last trade in New York.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1057" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/b_Silver-price-decemder-2016.png" alt="Silver-price-december-2016" width="1199" height="898" />

&nbsp;

We would like to call your attention to the <u>short-term steep wedge</u> formation now visible on the silver chart above, shown between the teal and blue trendlines. As periodically mentioned, these wedge formation typically represent reversal or bottoming patterns. In this case, we see steep declining highs since early November, and less steep lows forming since July.

While silver could fall further still within the wedge pattern, <strong>a break of the upper trendline should represent a tradable breakout </strong>for those so inclined to initiate short-term trades<strong>.</strong> On the breakout, an initial target will be $16.25, the broken support from November, with a possibility of an advance toward $17.25, the resistance from early December.

<u>However, a word of caution</u>: breaks from wedges as steep as above cannot be relied upon to represent terminal bottoms in and of themselves. The old investment adage: "The steeper the trend, the less important the break," comes to mind here, and is relevant because the wedge in question is extremely steep (for comparison, a less-steep long-term wedge was observed from 2013 - 2015 in the silver market, and represented a much stronger candidate for a bottom).

Because this wedge is so steep, it may not represent the final low for this retracement in silver. However, it should mark an end to the most severe portion of silver's decline.

Another way to visualize the steepness of silver's recent decline-- and hence likelihood of a rebound in the near future -- is to note that the slope can be observed to be forming a reverse parabolic curve since the summer highs, which is approaching an infinite downward rate by late January. Since such an infinite negative slope is impossible for an asset that cannot go to zero, we know that the current rate of decline will necessarily end in the next few weeks, and such should represent the tradable bounce at minimum. The only question is: does silver make its bounce sooner, or after one final drop over the next two weeks. Both options are highlighted in green, below, on the SLV chart (proxy for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver bullion</a>, used to show intraday price/volume data).

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1058" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/c_SLV-chart-ST-december-2016.png" alt="SLV-chart-ST-december-2016" width="1110" height="830" />

&nbsp;

The key technical point is to watch for the break of the wedge as shown on the main silver chart above to indicate when the worst of the retracement in silver is over.

We will put the full-year relative price performance together for gold, silver, and related markets in our 2016 review, next week.

		<title>2016 Year in Review</title>
		<content><![CDATA[With the arrival of 2017 and another year in the record books, we take a look back at the closing data for 2016 and the major trends that impacted world markets.

For the year, across the major asset classes that we follow, we note the following 2016 ending performances:

</tbody>
</table>
</div>
In sum, despite the wild volatility, the precious metals put in respectable performances for the full year. These were the first gains for the metals on a yearly basis since 2012, which may indicate the beginning of a trend change.
<h3>"No Confidence" Goes Mainstream</h3>
The most significant theme that we perceived across the political landscape for 2016 was a vote of "no confidence" in the establishment regime. This growing voice of dissent was evident across three major political votes during the year and countless smaller movements worldwide.

First was the vote by British citizens to leave the EU in June. Dubbed "Brexit", the vote came as a surprise to most major polling and media outlets. Central causes of the British dissent are believed to focus on issues of the economy, immigration, and sovereignty. And while a debate of those issues is beyond the scope of this publication, we can clearly observe the net result: the resignation of Prime Minster David Cameron and a major signal of dissatisfaction by UK residents toward the established political regime.

Second came Donald Trump's election in November. Again largely dismissed by the mainstream media and polling organizations even up until the night of the election, the Trump victory came as a surprise to many. Trump will be the first US President to never hold prior political office. A significant message that we take away from the US election is that there are many more voters dissatisfied with the largely superficial "Republican/Democrat" divide than were previously believed to have existed. We did not officially endorse either candidate in the US election; yet clearly there is a growing sense of "no confidence" in the political system here in the United States, and many voters chose to voice that sentiment through a vote for Trump.

Last but not least, the Italian citizens delivered a third anti-establishment vote in rejecting the constitutional amendment proposed by then-Prime Minster Matteo Renzi in December. Largely perceived as supportive of large banks and corporations, Italians rejected the amendment by a final count of over 59%. Renzi resigned the next day.
<h3>The Seeds of a Precious Metals Bull Market Are Being Sown</h3>
Angst in the political system is currently being voiced through the democratic process.

However, it is only a matter of time before that distrust is voiced further through the monetary system. When individuals begin to wake up to the understanding that they are being robbed by the central banks -- <em>regardless of which party is voted in or out of office</em> -- they will then move to vote separately with their pocketbooks. And as <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver spot price</a> remain to this day the only assets completely outside the control of major governments or central banks, they remain the focal point of the growing movement against establishment political planning.

This theme of distrust by citizens toward their established political systems and central banks is a key component of our fundamental investment thesis for precious metals.

As of 2016, still relatively few citizens of the major democratic nations have any knowledge whatsoever regarding precious metals, and even fewer own the monetary assets. In our every day lives, how many people do we know who actually own precious metals in any form? I would urge readers to do some random polling at their workplace, at the coffee shop, at the grocery store, etc. If your experience is anything like mine, you will find that the metals are still barely even known as a legitimate asset class amongst average Americans.

Let us examine the silver market: current estimates show that only 2 billion ounces of silver exist in the investable form above ground.

What if 10% of the combined population of the United States, Great Britain, and Italy each wanted to buy 100 ounces of silver, a modest $1,600 at today's prices?

Our back-of-the-envelope math shows that the combined population of those three countries is 450 million. So if 45 million citizens each wanted to buy 100 ounces of silver, the net result would be a new demand of 4.5 billion ounces.

The silver is not there. The result of such demand coming into such a small market would be that the price would be forced upward by many-fold, as the total dollar amount of metal available for purchase pales in comparison to the dollar supply floating around in individuals' bank accounts.

Even though the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> total market size is much larger than that of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, we have data to show that even gold is widely under-owned to this day. Below we show gold as a percentage of global financial assets (data courtesy CPM).

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1067" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/b_gold-percentgold-global-financial-assets.png" alt="gold-percentgold-global-financial-assets" width="757" height="454" />

&nbsp;

At just under 0.7% of global assets, gold would need to rise four-fold to reach the relative peak set in 1980 when it first hit $850/oz and silver briefly touched $50. As silver remains below its 1980 peak to this day, its advance would likely be greater than gold on a percentage basis.

Momentum is gaining in opposition to the status quo political landscape, and 2016 saw evidence in three major western nations. Those voters are willing to step out and cast a ballot. It is only a matter of time before a critical mass makes the connection between the political world and the financial world and casts a further vote via a movement of assets into the precious metals market.

		<content><![CDATA[We have speculated often over the past year that long-dated US bonds were near the end of their unprecedented 36-year bull market. More evidence continues to show up that the trend has begun to shift and that what we have called the "bond bubble" of the last decade is set to begin deflating.

The chart below shows the price of 30-year US bonds from 1980 through the end of 2016. Note that yields, which are currently just under 3.0 %, move opposite to the bond price.

The final phase of the bubble has coincided with a parabolic rise in the price of bonds since 2011 (shown in blue). Parabolic curves typically define the final stages of a bubble or mania, and the price escalates ever upward in an unsustainable fashion after what was an orderly bull market in years past.

Note the breakdown that has just occurred over the last month, with bond prices piercing the parabolic curve decisively lower. We do not anticipate a collapse in bond prices imminently, but rather a new trend of lower prices and higher yields to begin developing over the coming years.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1105" title="US-Bonds-price-1980-2016" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/a_US-Bonds-price-1980-2016.png" alt="US-Bonds-price-1980-2016" width="1150" height="684" />

&nbsp;

It cannot be overstated how important this shift toward lower bond prices and higher interest rates will be for the majority of world citizens, as the United States -- and by consequence many allied governments -- have become addicted to the cheap credit supplied by an ever-willingness of bond investors to loan the US government money at ever-lower interest rates.

Everything from national defense, to our financial system, to our social welfare programs, to our real estate markets, have been given their capacities and valuations by the availability of cheap credit via the bond market. All investors who have been active in any market for 36 years or less know only falling interest rates as their financial backdrop.

This paradigm is soon to be flipped upside down, and after a generation of falling rates, it is not inconceivable that a generation of rising interest rates is set to come.
<h3>Gold Versus Bonds</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1106 size-full" title="Gold-Bonds-1980-2016" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/b_Gold-Bonds-1980-2016.png" alt="Gold-Bonds-1980-2016" width="952" height="635" />

&nbsp;

We should note that for much of 2016, and especially during the second half, both gold and US bonds have been moving in tandem, rising during Brexit and falling after the Trump victory.

Notwithstanding the slight outperformance by gold, both were considered "safety assets" and investors generally bought and sold both assets together.

This may lead some investors to fear that gold will continue to decline with bonds, if the bond bubble has burst.

Over the long run, we must state that gold and bonds are intrinsically located on opposite ends of the safety spectrum. While <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> has represented money and retained its value for over 5,000 years of history, bonds are essentially paper contracts which are, in many respects, an inferior asset than even US dollars during an inflationary episode.

Whereas US dollars can at least be used now and converted into tangible assets, bonds represent a set number of US dollars to be paid <em>in the future</em>.

Through studying historic inflationary periods, from the 1920’s in Weimar Germany to the 1970’s in the United States, we learn that such episodes, the single worst asset to hold is a bond. Meanwhile, precious metals tend to be the best performers. So while gold and bonds are currently being viewed by the market as both generic "safety assets", this correlation will not continue indefinitely.

Below we can see that the above relationship, when viewed over a proper timeframe, yields a different perspective: since the bond bull market began in 1980, gold moved opposite it for the first 20 years, only to play catch up from 2000 onward, followed by the brief period of high correlation seen recently:

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1108" title="gold-bonds-2000-2016" src="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/c_gold-bonds-2000-2016.png" alt="gold-bonds-2000-2016" width="1150" height="767" />
<h3>Gold’s Long-Term Outlook</h3>
Backing out our typical short-term perspective of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> for the longer-term view: we continue to believe that the zone shown in green, between $850 - $1,045 as defined by the confluence of the four important technical levels labeled on the chart, represented the highest likelihood for a long-term bottom after the 2011 – 2015 decline.

Should gold retrace further into the green zone during 2017, we expect it will form a nominal new low in price, perhaps down to $1,000 or $925, as a final bear market bottom. It is quite possible that this low has already been established as of late 2015, with the current retracement representing a higher-low or double-bottom pattern now in formation.

The process that we are navigating in typical weeks through the shorter-term charts represents the complexity with which these longer-term multi-year bottoms form.

		<title><![CDATA[2016 - 2020 Silver & Gold Queen's Beasts Release Updates]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the internationally known and praised coins in the bullion market have decades of history in their mintage, but this Queen’s Beasts series is a new and exclusive release from the </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/government-mints/royal-mint"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Royal Mint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Queen’s Beasts series, inspired by hundreds of years of royal heraldry, includes ten coin designs, based on animals and mythical creatures. For over 500 years British monarchs have used beasts to symbolize their royal ancestry and family allegiances. The original Queen’s Beasts were a set of ten heraldic statues produced by the Ministry of Works for the coronation ceremony of Queen Elizabeth II on 2 June 1953. The Beasts stood at six feet in height and were composed of plaster and sculpted by renowned sculptor James Woodford.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1135 size-full" title="2016-2020-Silver-Gold-Queen-Beasts-Release-Updates" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Queens-Beasts-updates.jpg" alt="2016-2020-Silver-Gold-Queen-Beasts-Release-Updates" width="805" height="450" />
<b><i>Here are the released and upcoming design concepts which will form the entire series:</i></b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1st– The Lion of England – February 2016</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2nd-The Griffin of Edward III – October 2016</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3rd– The Red Dragon of Wales – March 2017</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4th– The Unicorn of Scotland – September 2017</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5th -The Black Bull of Clarence – March 2018</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6th- The Falcon of the Plantagenets – September 2018</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7th- The Yale of Beaufort – March 2019</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8th– The White Lion of Mortimer – September 2019</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">9th– The White Horse of Hanover – March 2020</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10th-The White Greyhound of Richmond – September 2020</span></li>
</ul>
<strong><i>Meanwhile, the Royal Mint hasn’t announced the final coins’ designs for 2018-2020 yet and no photos of coins are on hand now.</i></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">History tells us that at the coronation of Her Majesty The Queen, ten heraldic beasts stood guard. These creatures symbolized the various strands of royal ancestry brought together in the young woman about to be crowned queen. Each proud beast, used as a heraldic badge by the generations that went before her, was inspired by the King’s Beasts of Henry VIII that still line the bridge over the moat at his Hampton Court Palace. The original plaster statues now sit in the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau after the Canadian Government took possession of them in July 1959. James Woodford also sculpted a series of replicas out of Portland Stone, which stands proudly in the Kew Gardens of London.</span>

<b><i>History of the previous launches:</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The first released coin</strong> in this series was the </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2016-great-britain-1-oz-gold-queen-s-beast-coin-bu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lion of England,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> probably one of the most familiar beasts in the series. While many of the other beasts are fantastical or mythical creatures, the Lion is a real animal that is easy for people to imagine. The Lion has represented England for centuries and since the twelfth-century Lions have appeared on the coat of arms of every British monarch. It also appears in the Royal Arms, alongside the Scottish Unicorn, supporting the quartered shield, and is featured on many other important items, from coins to British passports.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The second release</strong> was </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-great-britain-1-oz-gold-queen-beast-griffin-bu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffin of Edward III</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an ancient mythical beast. It was considered a beneficent creature, signifying courage and strength combined with guardianship, vigilance, swiftness and keen vision. It was closely associated with Edward III, who engraved it on his private seal. The shield shows the Round Tower of Windsor Castle, where Edward III was born, with the Royal Standard flying from the turret, enclosed by two branches of oak surmounted by the royal crown.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both coins were designed by Royal Mint coin engraver – Jody Clark, who is also a designer of </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-great-britain-1-oz-silver-britannia-coin-bu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 Britannia coin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Her Majesty the Queen’s 5th portrait. The coins are also issued in </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/coins/british-silver-coins/the-queen-s-beasts-silver-coins"><span style="font-weight: 400;">silver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/british-gold/the-queen-s-beasts-gold"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gold</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> versions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The obverse of the entire series depicts the portrait of beloved British Monarch – Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.</span>

<strong>The third release</strong> in this series was a<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-great-britain-2-oz-silver-queen-s-beast-red-dragon-coin-ngc-ms-69-fdoi"> Red Dragon of Cadwallader</a>  - the emblem on the Wales national flag. The Red Dragon in this remarkable series displays the beast as clutching in its claws a shield with a lion in each quarter. The coin's obverse as usually depicts the portrait of beloved British Monarch – Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

<strong>The fourth release</strong> in the Queen's Beasts series is the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2018-great-britain-1-oz-gold-queens-beast-unicorn-of-scotland-coin">Unicorn of Scotland</a>.  The Unicorn of Scotland has been brought to life in a contemporary design by prestigious Royal Mint coin designer Jody Clark, who created the current coinage portrait of Her Majesty.  This magic animal is shown standing on its rear legs with its front hooves dangling over the royal badge of England, which includes an image of the Lion of England. The coin is available in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2018-great-britain-2-oz-silver-queens-beast-unicorn-coin">silver</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2018-great-britain-1-4-oz-gold-queens-beast-unicorn-of-scotland-coin">gold</a> versions.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As well as being an absolutely beautiful piece of artwork and manufactured due to the highest standards, the coin’s content and weight are backed by the UK Government. Limited edition of this series, excellent quality, and legal tender status in the UK make this series a great addition to any precious metals collection.</span>

		<title>Volatility Expected as Gold Tests $1,200</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold was up nearly $23 last week to finish at $1,196 as of the final trade in New York on Friday. Such was the third weekly gain in a row for the historically-monetary metal.</span>A technical update on the price of gold is in order after our analysis of December 26 came within a few days of identifying the most recent low at $1,120.  Gold is at a technical juncture, the resolution of which is going to play a large role in defining the trend and level of volatility to be expected for 2017.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1151 size-full" title="gold price volatility 2017" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3.png" width="1210" height="905" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The price level between $1,190 and $1,200 is the most important that we are presently watching (black double line, labeled Initial Resistance). This price zone acted as support for gold once in February, once in March, and once again in late May. When a price level acts as support on multiple occasions, it increases the legitimacy of the buying pressure seen there. In essence, we saw the same group of value-buyers step in each time the price approached $1,200 last spring.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, something changed last November as the price retreated in the wake of the reversal, following <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/11/14/trump-victory-markets-reverse-course/">Trump’s victory</a>. The gold price fell through $1,200 with only so much as a two-day bounce. For whatever reason, those buyers who were present through most of 2016 at this level failed to show up in November.</span>
<h3><b>Gold Approaches $1,200 Again</b></h3>
After bouncing at $1,120, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is now approaching the $1,200 region again, this time from the lower side. In technical analysis, a major principle that becomes relevant is that support typically turns into resistance. What this means is that – all things being equal – we would expect that the $1,200 zone, which saw a lack of large buyers suddenly in November, should again see limited buying activity when the price is approached again.

Thus, our general expectation at this juncture is for gold to back off in the current price region, and to begin to retreat back to December 2016’s lows. A likely scenario we will be watching for is a double bottom, or perhaps a higher low to form here in 2017, when compared to 2015 and 2016’s lows of $1,045 and $1,120, respectively.

However, if gold were to surprise us and continue to advance through $1,200 immediately, it would be an important indicator for 2017. It would show us that a new set of buyers had entered the market who were not present during last November’s decline.

Such would have important ramifications for the rest of the year. First, we would set our sights on the next target at $1,251, which was the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire 2016 advance, and beyond that the $1,300 region, which represents the long-term 2011-2016 downtrend that still holds.However, even more importantly, if we see a surge above $1,200 at this juncture, it would represent the beginning of increased volatility for the gold market for the remainder of the year. In essence, we will be seeing a new group of buyers enter the market – and we do not have enough price data to gauge their buying patterns yet. They could be physical buyers who missed out on the 2016 rally, they could be central banks anticipating the need to support currencies, they could be a new class of traders. We cannot be certain on their identities, but we can be certain that they were not present in significant quantities last November -- so their presence must be considered a source of expected volatility over the remainder of 2017.
<h3><b>Gold Volatility Expected</b></h3>
A<img class="alignright wp-image-1152 size-medium" title="where to find the biggest market moves 2017" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2-300x121.png" width="300" height="121" />s an interesting corollary, below is a cutout from last week’s Bloomberg article, with the title shown at right. The article highlights that the options market, which allows investors to make highly-leveraged bets in either direction for an underlying asset, is pricing in the highest volatility of any sector in the world specifically for the precious metals equities in 2017. Shown by the red shaded area below, the options market is pricing in a 34% volatility premium for the large and mid-cap gold producers (GDX) and a 44% volatility premium for the junior miners (GDXJ).

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The implied volatility premium is the portion of the contract value that options writers build into the option price to cover their perceived volatility risk. The higher the implied volatility, the higher the premium that options writers demand to sell the contracts.</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1150 size-full" title="gold stocks options most volatile 2017" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/1.png" width="825" height="333" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While most readers will be primarily concerned with prices for the physical bullion market, there is a price relationship between the companies that mine for gold and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">the price of gold</a> itself. After all, we are talking about two different sides of the same sector.</span>

So if options writers are anticipating the highest volatility of any sector in the world for the precious metals equities, we can be certain they are also expecting volatility in the value of their products, the underlying metals.
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we monitor the price action around $1,200 for gold over the coming week, let us remember that advances and retracements are expected to be increasingly volatile over the coming year, as new classes of investors enter the market. However, with volatility comes opportunity. </span>

Those looking to avoid the expected gyrations this year would do well to consider a strategy of dollar-cost averaging into their positions over a number of months, while those on a more active trading program will benefit by keeping in mind the technical levels mentioned herein.

		<title>President Trump and the Federal Reserve</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

The Trump era is officially upon us. While we are politically-independent here and not officially supportive of either major American party, we believe Trump’s election and inauguration last Friday is part of a larger worldwide trend in the emergence of “no confidence” votes against the mainstream political establishments. Manifesting here in the United States, Trump’s tenure should be a particularly unique period of history to be an observer of, with reverberations to be felt around the world.

Case in point: Trump is the first President in modern history to openly criticize the Federal Reserve for its money-printing practices. Saying Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen should be “ashamed” of keeping interest rates too low (which requires printing money to buy short-dated bonds), accusing the Fed of creating a “false economy” and engaging in “political things” – this is unprecedented rhetoric coming from a presidential candidate during a major campaign.

The Chinese proverb says: <em>“May you live in interesting times.”</em> Indeed.
<h3>The Fed and the White House</h3>
The last president to openly criticize the Fed is believed to have been George H. W. Bush, who spoke about the central bank <em>after</em> his 1992 defeat. Ironically, Bush blamed the Fed for <strong><em>not printing enough</em></strong> money, saying: <em>“I think that if the interest rates had been lowered more dramatically that I would have been re-elected President, because the [economic] recovery that we were in would have been more visible.”</em>

Fast forward to last September, in which the relationship between the White House and the Fed over the preceding generation was perfectly illustrated by Hillary Clinton when she said: <em>“You should not be commenting on Fed actions when you are either running for president or you are president.”</em>

So now we have Trump who indeed seems comfortable commenting on Fed actions while running for president. Will he consider criticizing the central bank while actually in office?

Consider that Rebekah Mercer, daughter of billionaire hedge-fund CEO Robert Mercer, sat on the executive committee of Trump’s transition team. She is expected to play a key role in fostering Trump’s agenda during his presidency. Her father, Robert Mercer, in addition to being head of the famed Renaissance Technologies fund, was the chief backer of the Jackson Hole Summit in August 2015, a private financial symposium designed to stand in contrast to the Fed’s own conference held at the same time and place.

The principle themes of the Mercer-funded summit? <strong>The abolishment of the Federal Reserve and a return to the gold standard</strong>.

With the advisory and financial backing of billionaires with anti-Fed leanings, will Trump be the first president in modern history to question the seemingly omniscient central bank during his term?

And how would most Americans – who are still largely unaware that the US dollar is not backed by any tangible asset – respond to a president questioning the institution that issues our fiat currency?

Any significant move of assets into <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> by a substantial portion of the United States (or world) citizens would cause a price acceleration unlike anything witnessed thus far in our analysis.

This is why, even as we endeavor to profit from the shorter-term swings in price that occur, we always advocate that investors hold a <em>certain</em> portion of their assets in a core metals position, stored as far outside the banking system as reasonably possible.

And so as Trump begins his first full week in office, the first active president to openly criticize the central bank in modern history, we once again try to filter out the charged rhetoric that appears in the mainstream financial and political press and turn as always to the charts.
<h3>US Dollar Update</h3>
In a confounding example of either early-presidential double-talk, or perhaps a reference to the singular currency-devaluation policies of China, Mr. Trump – who spoke so harshly of Federal Reserve money-printing on the campaign trail – stated on Tuesday that the US dollar was “too strong”.

The result on Tuesday was to send the dollar back to 100.2 on the Dollar Index, down over 1% for the day against a basket of foreign currencies.

It is here that words from politicians can become misleading and we must focus on regular identification of key zones on the charts:

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1162" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/a_USD-Dollar-Index-jan-2017.png" alt="USD-Dollar-Index-jan-2017" width="1014" height="881" />


While the dollar has been weak over the last month, roughly corresponding to <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold’s price</a> rise from the December lows, this price action must still be viewed within the context of the breakout from the 2-year consolidation shown above between 92 and 100 on the index.

What we see thus far is simply a higher retest of the breakout zone.

We must respect the dollar breakout until proven otherwise, as it will tend to exert a negative drag on the precious metals in a typical trading environment.

We would consider the move in the dollar to have failed and thus to constitute an ominous long-term “false breakout” should the index close below 99.5, the spike low seen on December 8. Such a failed advance can typically lead to a strong reversal in the opposite direction.

Of course, the dollar and precious metals do not always move in opposite directions, and are sometimes highly correlated, a topic we will examine in more depth in the near future.

Happy investing this week, as we enter what should be a fascinating time to be a market observer if the new president does openly decide to criticize the Fed at any point during the next four years.

		<title>Gold Technical Update – Short Term Gyrations Amidst Long-Term Bottom</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold was resilient over the last two weeks in holding up over the $1,200 level, and indeed almost had us fooled that it was about to ignore this resistance and continue to advance higher.  Yet after several failures to mount a sustained advance, gold succumbed to selling pressure by Tuesday. For the week, gold closed down $16 or 1.4% to finish at $1,188 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday.   </span>

Although <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> did push above the $1,200 figure marginally, the message of the market here is of sellers who showed up every time gold attempted to make some distance above the round number. We can thus update our primary gold chart below, with Initial Resistance labeled as $1,200 - $1,215.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1174" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-1.png" alt="Primary Gold Chart " width="1199" height="898" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our short-term expectations for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> continue to call for lower prices. At the same time, we can tentatively draw a new trendline between the December 2015 low and the higher December 2016 low, as shown above in blue (dashed).</span>

It would be extremely healthy action to see the new trendline tested and held for a second time at a nominally higher level, such as $1,130 - $1,135. This is where gold would meet the trend if it were to test it this week.
<h3><b>Gold’s Long-Term Basing Perspective</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Backing out the timeframe, periodically it is beneficial to strip away previous annotations and start with a blank chart, to gauge the big-picture trend of the market.  Below is gold from 2011 to present, with minimal annotations near the current price – instead of with a focus toward the major pattern developing over the last five years:</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1175 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-2.png" alt="Gold Long-term Perspective" width="1203" height="900" />

Despite the weakness is seen since July, what is emerging here in gold is a five-year “cup” base pattern. This basing pattern features multiple swings of $300 higher and lower in both directions – but as a sum, we are observing a clear rounded bottoming pattern, with a reduced rate of decline from 2013 – 2015 now giving way to the beginning of an advancing market.

Strong evidence for the shift in trend can be seen from the fact that the 2016 high of $1,378 clearly exceeded both the 2015 high of $1,305 and the mid-2014 high of $1,345. A bear market is defined by lower peaks – and when a new peak, such as that seen in 2016, exceeds a prior one – it is telling us that the market is in the process of changing behavior.
<h3><b>Anticipating Short-Term Potentials</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, these changes take the time to play out and are filled with wild short-term gyrations. The question that we still cannot definitively answer is: was the recent December 2016 $1,124 low the bottom for the entirety of the correction off 2016’s peak?</span>

The above base scenario assumes that it was – and if so, after a somewhat higher low due to form within the next few weeks, gold should continue two-steps forward, one step backward advances through the remainder of the year to re-challenge the 2016 high at $1,378.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, let us imagine that the recent low does not hold and that gold continues to grind down further for several months – retesting the 2015 bottom in the vicinity of $1,045. The two hypotheticals are presented below through the green target callouts:</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1176" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-3.png" alt="Gold Short-Term Potentials" width="1200" height="913" />

&nbsp;

<b>Neither of the above two scenarios would change the validity of the basing action we are observing in the long-term cup formation above.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If a double bottom or a grind below $1,100 in gold must occur, it will only expand out the timeline of the basing formation, not change the overall pattern. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of the higher high in 2016 amidst a lessening rate of decline over the three years prior should not be underestimated (large red circle, above). This market is in the process of changing its trend after the 2011 – 2015 decline… it is only the precise gyrations that remain to be seen and navigated.</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review- January, 31</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">With all the late events in US policy and on the international platform, a lot of people are scared of market changes and worried that the entire move of gold prices this year could be a fake manipulation or that some giant drop is going to happen.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every investor less or more experienced knows that the financial markets move in cycles and you cannot avoid the fact that the market manipulation exists. Therefore, we should also consider other reasons for investing in precious metals instead of sharp actions based only on the possible collapse of Media information. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you once decided to be part of this “investing team”, you will automatically keep the questions “Should we expect the gold prices to rise”, “Should we expect another drop”? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So many options can be used to speculate on falling stock prices, and to hedge against falling prices to protect long-only portfolios. Panic is mostly needles and you cannot follow and predict all of them. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bullion Exchanges has decided to report impartial precious metals market updates for helping our customers to stay up-to-date with the mainstream market news. In the current market situation, it’s wise to look for the alternative ways to secure your wealth.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All our articles published here are to inform your thinking, not lead it. Only you can decide the best place for your investment, and also any decision can put money at risk.  </span>

&nbsp;

<b><i>Gold is up 1.4% at $1,212 per ounce today highest from January 24, silver rises to the strongest point since December 8, Dow Jones index drops down triple digits (-148.47/-0,74% Today’s Change), and investors are waiting for  US Fed meeting today!</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
With negative cues from all corners, we may see Trump’s policy looks not market-friendly at all, and investors are frantically looking for safe havens for their wealth. After all the predictions and market analysis, it seems like our worst predictions finally becoming truth.Meanwhile, a series of comments from the Trump administration about the foreign exchange market could crush all good expectations. Donald Trump Trade Chief Peter Navarro alleged Germany is abusing euro for own gain. Later President Trump said other countries take advantage of the US by devaluing their currencies. Earlier Mr. Navarro accused “cheating  China” of destroying US factories and flooding the US with “defective and cancerous” exports.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After Trump’s immigration ban temporarily restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, investors across the country got a “risk-off” reaction through the global financial markets. Technology companies also sagged on worries that future administration moves will make it harder for them to hire skilled, foreign-born workers, global stocks announced the biggest lost in six weeks after Trump signed this executive order and fired the government lawyer Sally Yates, who refused to support his decision. </span>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> keep staying under increasing inflationary pressure. With all the sort of protests happening now across the country, the US market looks highly unstable on the international platform.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today the investors and traders are waiting for the closed meeting of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at 1:00 PM on Tuesday, January 31, 2017. There the latest legal developments and issues of official Board business are scheduled to be discussed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, Trump’ policy remains the main driver for gold and all these issues don’t go away anytime soon. Bullion Exchanges will keep our customers with relevant news that could affect markets. </span>]]></content>

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold </a>drops down at $ 1,205.90 </i></b><b><i>(-5.30)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price -$ 17.52 </i></b><b><i>(-0.09</i></b><b><i>), Dow Jones index drops up 19,959.19 </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.48%)</i></b><b><i>, Fed Report highlights and FOMC scheduled meeting today!</i></b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors among the globe are looking forward to the preview results of the first FED meeting on Tuesday since President Trump took office. Also, FOMC will publish its first annual report today.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/01/23/trump-federal-reserve-dollar-index/">Trump’s announcement</a> that he would likely replace the Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen when her term of office expires in February 2018, a lot of investors are expecting the relationship between the Executive branch and the Fed is going to be very intense in following months.</span>
<h3><b>US Dollar updates:</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Gold went back on Wednesday, the dollar firmed ahead and recovered a little ground after recording its worst start to the year in three decades on concerns the United States was poised to ditch its two-decade-old "strong dollar" policy. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/11/21/dollar-surges-bonds-fall-trump-aftermath/">dollar index</a> traded less than 0.3 percent above the previous day's seven-week low on Wednesday, while the euro traded down 0.3 percent on the day just below $1.08.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not good news for the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold </a>market, as the dollar hike may strengthen the confidence in the U.S. economy and its currency, which is gold's biggest rival.</span>
<h3><b>New Fed and FOMC economic forecast:</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fed and FOMC hold about eight regularly scheduled meetings during the year and other if required. FOMC annual report, providing the information about financial statements, statistical tables and maps will be published on February, 1.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To summarize the Federal Reserve meeting, we can say most analytics are in wait-and-see mode on the Trump economy. They're clearly paying attention to the debate over fiscal policy but aren't ready to move forecasts yet until they have a clearer idea what the president will do. The perspective that Fed's plan to raise rates three times, instead of two times, next year is highly possible. The election was the main difference for a market in 2016 and we like it or not Trump’s victory changed the market pulse. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The final economic projections the Fed will release only in March. For now, there are some good reasons to expect that Fed’s position after Trump’s decisions addressed to them will soften in 2017, which would be positive for the gold price. The experts say the technical situation in the gold market is different now. In 2015, gold turned out to be oversold, while in 2016 only 30 % was sold in the first half of the year, and even gold dropped down in November 2016, it was still not oversold before the Fed's move in December.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These expectations might be built on just predictions, but it does not change a situation where the current sentiment towards gold is negative, we hope it may change later in 2017.</span>

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold</a> goes up at $ 1,222.30 </i></b><b><i>(+14.30)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price $ 17.73 </i></b><b><i>(+0.20</i></b><b><i>), Dow Jones index goes up to 19,831.09 </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.30%)</i></b><b><i>, Global Stock Market overview and US companies report earnings!</i></b>
<h3><b>Global Stock Market overview</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stock market opened lower on Thursday as uncertainty related to the new administration’s diplomacy. President Donald Trump had harsh comments with Australia and Mexico, both of which are important allies and trading US partners, and he also put Iran "on notice" over potential new sanctions after the country performed a ballistic missile test.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many individual stock markets are already in a bear market, including Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, and Japan.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these events beg the question: Will the U.S. fall into the bear market too?</span>
<h3><b>U.S. dollar updates</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar keeps remaining lower level against other major currencies on Thursday, despite the report earnings of U.S. companies, jobless claims data, as markets were still digesting the Bank of England’s earlier policy decision, as well as the Federal Reserve’s statement released on Wednesday.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. companies report earnings</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">What should every investor know about company's earning reports? There is always a probability that stock market and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> price could fall after the companies announce their earnings reports quarterly and annually. But in fact, expectations always play a key role in stock’s price changes than actual announcements of earning reports. </span>The investors with a long-term view are not likely to make changes to their holdings based on a single earnings announcement.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We encourage our clients to stay current on macro events and geopolitical challenges. However, don’t  make any sharp decisions because of micromanagement messaging from the media.</span>]]></content>

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold</a> goes up at $ 1,220.20 </i></b><b><i>(+0.40)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price $ 17.56 </i></b><b><i>(+0.05)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index goes up to 20,051.32 </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.84%)</i></b><b><i>, Employment Situation report! </i></b>

The gold price hits 12-week highs.

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. dollar updates</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar keeps climbing in the aftermath of the Federal Reserve's decision to raise rates for the second time this decade. The US dollar index</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is up by 0.8% at 103.01 as of 7:21 a.m. ET — an almost 14-year high.  </span>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Jobs report</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's the first jobs report to be released under the Trump administration. The jobs report has also become a contentious issue because President Trump once dubbed the unemployment rate a "hoax." Meanwhile, the Trump administration talks a lot about bringing in lots of news jobs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">US markets are on the rise after the better than expected headline jobs figure, with financial companies also benefitting from the prospect of looser regulation.</span>

		<title><![CDATA[Gold & Silver vs Commodities]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Thompson Reuters/Jeffries Commodity Research Bureau Index (CRB Index) is a weighted index of 19 commodities that trade on exchanges worldwide, composed of energy products, precious and industrial metals, and agricultural commodities. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We typically perform a relative strength analysis of gold or silver versus the CRB commodity index below our primary precious metals charts. This gives a quick reference to see if <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold </a>and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> are mostly being impacted by their inclusion with other world commodities (as funds and institutions will often buy “a basket of commodities” for investment purposes all at once), or if there is something unique happening to the precious metals irrespective of other commodities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the weightings and components of the index have changed since it was first published in 1947, the CRB is still largely the best measure we have for broad price trends amongst major world commodities. The 19 specific contracts now included: aluminum, cocoa, coffee, copper, corn, cotton, crude oil, gold, heating oil, lean hogs, live cattle, natural gas, nickel, orange juice, silver, soybeans, sugar, unleaded gas, and wheat.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is a chart of the CRB Commodity Index from 1980 through the present, with relative strength comparisons between gold versus the CRB and silver versus the CRB below it:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1233 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/CRB-02.06.17-1024x924.png" alt="Chart of the CRB Commodity Index" width="840" height="758" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important point to note on this chart is that </span><b>worldwide commodity prices are currently at lows not seen in over 40 years. </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Commodity prices are lower than they were during the dot-com bubble, lower than the recession of 2001, and – astonishingly – lower than during the worldwide financial crisis of 2008-2009.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To imagine that the global demand versus supply equilibrium for industrial &amp; agricultural commodities is poorer than it was during the greatest financial crisis of our lifetimes is difficult to fathom – but it is exactly what the charts are telling us.</span>
<h3><b>Precious Metals Relative Strength</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below the main chart are ratios showing gold versus the CRB and silver versus the CRB. These ratios show the relative strength between the precious metals and the 19-commodity CRB Index.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we can see that gold has outperformed the basket of commodities 300% since 2006, while silver has outperformed 350%. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another data point we can reference is that while the CRB is now below its 2008 financial crisis lows, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold spot price</a> is still well above its 2008 crash low ($680 per ounce), as is silver ($8.50 per ounce), respectively.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus… something happening to the precious metals that are not happening within other commodity markets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is strong evidence that not all commodities are being treated the same within the investment world.</span>
<h3><b>What is Relative Strength Telling Us?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This outperformance since 2006 is in stark contrast to the near tandem price action that bound precious metals to the rest of the commodity complex between 1982 and 2006. This performance is visible from the nearly flat-line on the relative strength charts during that timeframe (red highlights).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We speculate that starting around 2006, amidst increased monetary debasement by central banks and unsustainable debt loads by a world government, a certain portion of investors began to favor the precious metals for their historic monetary roles. This is a demand that is above and beyond the usage the metals have in industrial fabrication, which is what was appearing across the rest of the commodity complex. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We anticipate that the divergence between precious metals and other commodities which started in 2006 will be seen as the initial stages of what will become a larger worldwide phenomenon over the coming decade.</span>
<h3><b>Applying Relative Strength</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that relative strength indicators are best observed as markets are declining – because we can see evidence of underlying accumulation happening behind the scenes. What we see is that physical buyers have been accumulating precious metals even as their prices were falling alongside other commodities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rising relative strength is important to observe during declines because it shows us which sectors should lead when the overall commodity complex finally bottoms. For example, it is likely that oil bottomed in early 2016 at $26 per barrel and natural gas bottomed similarly at $1.60 per million British Thermal Units (mmBTU). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While there will be opportunities across the entire commodity complex over the next several years, relative strength indicators are telling us that precious metals are poised to lead the advance higher as stabilization occurs across the entire commodity spectrum.</span>

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold</a> goes up at $ 1,230.60 </i></b><b><i>(+10.00)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price $ 17.75 </i></b><b><i>(+0.19)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index drops down to 20,037.30 </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.17%)</i></b><b><i>, Stock Market today!</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. dollar updates</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. dollar rose on Monday, trending higher throughout the session as investors bet that Europe could see continued dovish monetary policy going forward, although geopolitical uncertainty remains elevated.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dollar index was getting stronger at 99.96 from 99.88 last week. </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are no top-tier economic events scheduled for Monday. In general Wall Street stocks traded modestly lower on Monday as the main indexes pulled back amid mixed earnings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.15%  fell 29 points, or 0.2%, to 20.041 as gains in Apple Inc. Over the past two weeks, investors have shown to be jittery after controversial policy announcements, such as travel ban applying to people from seven predominantly Muslim countries.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the market still appears to be uneasy about the recent executive orders on immigration and travel bans from seven nations in the Middle East and Northern Africa. Many of the world’s largest technology firms, including Alphabet (GOOG) and Amazon.com (AMZN), have condemned the executive orders, which were temporarily overturned by a Federal Court this week. This situation remains very fluid and may impact trading in the days to come, especially with the light schedule for the business beat this week.</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold</a> goes up at $ 1,232.50 </i></b><b><i>(+0.60)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price $ 17.80 </i></b><b><i>(+0.02)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index rises to 20,132.93  </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.40%)</i></b><b><i>, Stock market today!</i></b>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar updates</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar operated a bit better on Monday than the previous week, but it’s still fluttered above a more than 2-month low. At this point, it plays good assistance to precious metals’ spot value, that keeps rising. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts prognosticate there is nothing out there that think the Dollar is going to move upward in any sort of hurry.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold has been making a steady recovery from its Christmas low of $1,128.90. Also, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> has been increased in price not only in US dollar but other major currency ( Euros, Pounds Sterling, Japanese Yen), that performs the gold demand is higher and it has actually increased in value on a global arena. </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding slowly Monday across the global market and lack of top-tier economic events scheduled for this week, most investors are still discussing last week events. The <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/02/02/daily-market-review-february-2/">news</a> occupied traders' attention last week, as economic releases, jobs annual report and companies earnings reports slowed down experts forecast.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq hit new records high on Tuesday, recovering from losses in the previous session. In general, we can say that market is getting recovered after the release of very positive economic data, most notably - the report that the nation had added 227,000 jobs in January. More than half of all companies have reported results for the latest quarter and, in general, the outcomes have been favorable and have helped the stock market stay near record levels.</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold</a> goes up at $ 1,242.10 </i></b><b><i>(+6.00)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price $ 17.90 </i></b><b><i>(+0.06)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index drops down to 20,025.01  </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.32%)</i></b><b><i>, Stock market today!</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar updates</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar keeps benefiting from arising political uncertainty ahead of a number of crucial new Administration’s decisions. The dollar gains accelerated after China reported its foreign exchange reserves unexpectedly fell below the $3 trillion level in January for the first time in nearly six years. Until we have answers to some of the big (policy) questions the experts are fearful of what the administration is prepared to keep a lid on the dollar. This week President Trump has a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. A lot of investors worry, that with Trump pro-Japanese approach and anti-China stance this meeting could bring more issues to US dollar and other currencies.</span>

This is obvious, that a strong dollar means we have greater buying power. In other words, US currency is worthy outside of the country, based on the same logic, imports also become cheaper, can be good for any economy.

Meanwhile, the experts point out that these geopolitical happenings alone and rising dollar don’t provide safe demand for precious metals afloat and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> price particularly.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week is pretty quiet for market updates. The main changes: The S&amp;P energy sector led decliners, capping gains in the overall stock market, the oil prices have fallen, the Dow and Nasdaq hit record highs. There is no major economic data due Wednesday, shifting investors' focus, the market is waiting for the next big catalyst. </span>

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold</a> drops down at $ 1,226.80 </i></b><b><i>(-10.30)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price $ 17.78 </i></b><b><i>(-0.05)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index goes up to 20,224.49  </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.36%)</i></b><b><i>, Stock market today!</i></b>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>US Dollar</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After President Donald Trump once called National Security Adviser Mike Flynn to ask about the impact of strong US dollar and came up with the idea that strong dollar can be bad for US economy because American companies can’t compete with Chinese companies due to the strong US currency. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">New Administration suggests that strong dollar can hurt US based producers that export their goods, which become more expensive. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Governor of Central Bank of Iran announced that US Dollar will no longer be used within the country as a response to US President Donald Trump’s controversial temporary travel ban on certain countries including Iran.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, experts concern we can expect US Dollar might keep going down.  US Dollar forecasting is full of breakdowns, like any asset the dollar can go up, down or sideways. We suggest the best way is following the stock updates, because it may be some time yet before the central tendency reasserts itself, however.       </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">        </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors’ enthusiasm for President promises of tax cuts, deregulation, and fiscal stimulus leads the market in a  “fragile spot” this week. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street's three main indexes surged to fresh record highs on Thursday after President Donald Trump said he would make a major tax announcement in a few weeks. After the market drifted sideways for a couple weeks, now here it is at levels on the S&amp;P  (Standard &amp; Poor) where it has broken through overhead resistance," said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates. It means the US market could continue to grind higher from this point. </span>]]></content>

		<title>The US Dollar Is Looking Fragile – Silver to Be Major Beneficiary</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens with the US dollar over the next two months is going to be extremely important not only for the precious metals themselves, but for most world commodities and currencies. The world’s reserve currency is at a critical juncture, and we still see few mainstreamg analysts discussing the ramifications for what appears to be a reversal lower in the works for the dollar -- either imminently, or at the latest by end-2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For reference, the dollar had been consolidating for nearly two years between 92 and 100 on the US Dollar Index, shown below. In November, that consolidation broke out to the upside, which corresponded with the weakness seen in precious metals late in the year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This past week we have seen a bounce in the dollar at the lowest possible technical level for us to consider the November 2016 breakout in the Dollar Index to still be valid. Specifically, after falling for the last five weeks, the dollar rebounded at 99.5 and closed the week higher by 0.9%, to finish at 100.8 on the Index. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The medium-term perspective is updated below:</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1272" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Image-1-Feb-13-1024x609.png" alt="The medium-term perspective is updated below:" width="840" height="500" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the dollar held at the lowest threshold where we could still consider its breakout to remain valid (99.5) the US currency is looking increasingly fragile from a technical standpoint. </span>

<b>The weakness of the breakout is not indicative of a market prepared to move higher over the long run.   </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As an important data point: the most recent low of 99.5 (second retest of the breakout) matched exactly the level of the first retest from November 2016.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We thus do not have a higher low in the US Dollar Index following the initial breakout. New bull markets, especially in their early stages, should be characterized by higher highs and higher lows for medium-term pivots.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout from a two-year consolidation </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feature an impulsive move higher, and subsequent retests (lows) should come at sequentially higher levels.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, at this time we can observe that the most recent low in the dollar was not higher than the December low. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is negative technical divergence – and it leads us to suspect a reversal lower of a multi-year magnitude is in the early formation stages. The only question is: does sustained dollar weakness materialize within the next two months, or will a grinding advance continue for the remainder of this year first? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not have enough data yet to answer that question; however, those with an eye for long-term secular trends in the commodity and currency markets should be paying attention to this action in the US dollar very closely.</span>
<h3><b>Silver to Be a Major Beneficiary<img class="alignright wp-image-1273 size-medium" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Image-2-Feb-13-300x201.png" alt="Silver over Gold " width="300" height="201" /></b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is to be a falling US dollar backdrop either soon or within the next year, we would expect inflation to begin to pick up in the United States. Generally speaking, a falling US dollar will cause prices of commodities and international trade items to be more expensive as priced in the falling currency.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metals should “sniff” this inflation out ahead of time, like a well-trained hound. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, in an inflationary environment, silver should outperform gold on a relative basis, as the former has greater industrial usage in electronics and solar fabrication -– industries which would be supported by overall rising prices.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is exactly what we observe since the recent December 2016 lows, as <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> has outperformed <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> by over 5.3% in less than two months.</span>
<h3><b>Silver Recent Technical Analysis</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the week as a whole, silver finished higher by $0.45 cents or 2.6% to close at $17.93 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on
Friday.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The advance in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver spot price</a> this week resulted in a break of the best-fit trendline of the primary declining channel that we have been observing since early July (royal blue trend channel). This is a positive sign for the entire precious metals complex and continues to strengthen the legitimacy of the breakout we saw above the $17.25 (black horizontal line) resistance two weeks prior.</span>

<img class="alignright size-large wp-image-1274" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Image-3-Feb-13-1024x767.png" alt="Silver Recent Technical Analysis" width="840" height="629" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver looks healthy at this juncture, and despite the continued rising from the December lows, we observe that the RSI indicator (top of chart) it not yet at an overbought reading, as it was during intermediate peaks in 2016. Silver appears to have more room to run on this advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We should expect some grinding price action with short 2-3 day corrections over the next two weeks as traders ascertain the legitimacy of the breakout.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver should be supported at $17.00 - $17.25 on any weakness. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our near-term target for silver is $18.75, after which we will evaluate the possibility of an intermediate correction.</span>

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold</a> drops down at $ 1,226.90 </i></b><b><i>(-9.40)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price $ 17.98 </i></b><b><i>(-0.04)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index goes up to 20,338.60  </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.34%)</i></b><b><i>, Stock market today!</i></b>
<h3><b>US Dollar</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we already mentioned in our weekly analysis US dollar changes over the next two months are going to be extremely important for the precious metals themselves, and also for most world commodities and currencies. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. dollar gained against most major rivals on Monday after the weekend meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe went off without a hitch as far as currency policy is concerned.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday starts with the surprisingly good news relationship between the U.S. under Trump and two of Asia’s powerhouses: China and Japan and the rest of the week will keep investors busy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the week ahead, investors will hear from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen, who will appear before the Senate Banking committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services committee on Wednesday. Investors also will be watching U.K. consumer inflation data closely on Tuesday, as it could firm up expectations that British interest rates are headed higher.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock investors look forward to the final resolution of lower taxes and fiscal spending. Both of these plans are thus far, however, lacking in detail. The Trump administration says it will be announcing tax reforms in the near-future, and this announcement could potentially propel stocks even higher.</span>]]></content>

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold</a> drops down at $ 1,235.60 </i></b><b><i>(+9.30)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price $ 18.13 </i></b><b><i>(+0.23)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index goes up to 20,376.79  </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.34%)</i></b><b><i>, Stock market today!</i></b>
<h3><b>US Dollar </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollars keeps rising in value against currencies around the world, making the US manufacturing more competitive. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The USD Index is at its highest levels since the end of January now, and this is not allowing precious metals to stay vigorous. For now, US Dollar is moving higher on hopes that President Donald Trump will soon reveal a tax plan that is full of tax cuts. All throughout his campaign, and as recently as last week, Trump has commented with regard to tax cuts that are aimed at helping the beleaguered middle class.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week has a rather quiet start. There were not many changes in the way of fresh economic data to consider about, so investors are in a wait and see position. The market looks towards Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s key testimony to Congress over the next couples of days for fewer clues. However, her comments could be overlooked and used as provocative for a stock market, if she doesn’t provide much information.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets should definitely watch for Yellen’s view on the United States growth outlook and her view on the impact of Trump’s proposed fiscal expansion on monetary policy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The focus on the breakout in U.S. stocks is overshadowing an equally important event: a  global stock market breakout. While U.S. is up roughly 3 percent for the year, the rest of the world is outperforming, including emerging markets. Japan and Europe up 9 percent and 5 percent. Large regional ETFs markets are also leading to 52-week highs, including Latin America, the Pacific.</span>]]></content>

<b><i><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold</a> went up to $ 1,229.90 </i></b><b><i>(+3.40)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, Silver Price $ 17.98 </i></b><b><i>(+0.01)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index goes up to 20,528.47  </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.12%)</i></b><b><i>, the Stock market today! </i></b>
<h3><b><i>US Dollar vs Precious metals </i></b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent rising strength of the U.S. dollar has been widely publicized. For companies with international operations, foreign exchange swings can have a meaningful effect on their top and bottom lines in an annual business forecast. Regarding this US dollar changes, US producer prices rose recently by a seasonally-adjusted 6%, which defeated expectations by a good bit. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metals did not make a huge move: <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> gained about two dollars over spot, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> finished exactly as it started on Tuesday,  Platinum and Palladium didn’t add much value.  </span>
<h3><b><i>Stock Market Today</i></b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen was in Congress on Tuesday for the first day of her semiannual testimony on monetary policy. In her prepared speech to Congress,  she made it very clear that she has faith in US economy and it’s definitely continuing to grow. In her speech to the Senate Banking Committee, Yellen said the central bank can continue to raise interest rates slowly although it would be "unwise" to wait too long. The market is waiting for the second day of Ms. Yellen testimony because she is usually careful about keeping to the same message across both days of her speech. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">More news comes from Europe. Germany central bank has completed a transfer of gold bars worth $13 billion from New York to Frankfurt, part of a plan to repatriate roughly half the reserves it keeps abroad. Germany has been bringing gold home from New York and Paris since 2013, and about 642 tons has been already transferred. As always, there are many views of logistics and the mechanic's reasons when a country transfer its gold from foreign central banks. Some analytics call it "demonstration of confidence”, some suggest the urgency in repatriating Germany’s gold has more logic regarding the latest Trump’s announcements European policy to US Dollar. </span>]]></content>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>US Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar rose strongly on the back of good inflation and retail sales data from the United States in mid-week trade.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week market watchers were expecting new comments from Greece economists. Greece is considering to leave the EURO in favor to US dollar, and  Greek economists started analyzing benefits into taking on the USD banknotes if the country turns its back on the European single currency. Experts consider this news are leading to the logical reasons why Germany central bank has completed a transfer of gold bars recently worth $13 billion from New York to Frankfurt.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The current US dollar situation did not do precious metals any favors whatsoever.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets climb to New Highs following Trump’s meeting with a group of executives from big name retailers such a Target and Best Buy on Wednesday morning. Major retailers have come out swinging against a provision of the tax proposal known as border adjustment, which effectively creates a new tax on imports. In the opening speech, Trump told that “his administration stays very focused on the issues that will encourage economic growth”.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.52% to end at 20,611.86, while the Nasdaq Composite tacked on 0.64% to close at 5,819.44. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial stocks, which benefit from higher rates, rose 0.74 percent. The utilities and real estate sectors, both of which do worse in high-rate environments, fell 0.39 percent and 0.30 percent respectively.</span>]]></content>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price today $1,242.90 </i></b><b><i>(+0.80)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, Silver Price $18.09 </i></b><b><i>(-0.06)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index 20,578.88 </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.20%)</i></b><b><i>, Stock market review! </i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

Precious metals managed to gain slightly on Thursday as the Dollar backed off from a high growth.

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> prices continue rising in line with the weakening of the dollar across the board. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver</a> prices managed to pierce through $18.00 and it trades just above this figure, we can expect the silver prices also will remain buoyant during next week and maybe make good progress along with the gold prices as the pressure on US Dollar continues to exist.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold as the main instrument against the weakness in the dollar, seen over the past couple of months, is the center of all market watchers now. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks opened lower Friday as overseas markets traded generally lower and U.S. investors prepare for a three-day holiday weekend. Oil prices eased Friday morning leaving West Texas Intermediate just above $53 a barrel and down about 1% this week. </span>

Stock market strategists with the most optimistic outlooks this week say stocks could go even higher than their initial predictions,  supported by an improving economy, more profitable U.S. companies and hope that the New Administration will finally cut the tax.

		<title>Gold Targets $1,300</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several unique signals showing us that – barring minor intra-week corrections that could occur at any time – gold is set to move higher toward the $1,300 region before any more significant retracement may be due.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To arrive at this target, we examine both the relative strength of the gold mining complex and also the price action in silver. Based on analysis of these related but separate markets, we can conclude that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> itself still has further room to run over the intermediate timeframe.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us begin by examining the relative strength of the gold-mining sector versus the price action of gold bullion itself. Below we show the GDX large-cap gold mining fund on top with the price of gold immediately below it – stripped of all our typical annotations for a direct examination of relative performance.</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1320" title="GDX large-cap gold" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a_GDXGold-990x1024.png" alt="GDX large-cap gold" width="483" height="499" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The top green band shows that the gold miners are now back to a resistance level between 25-26 on the GDX fund, which was previously reached both last August and immediately following the Trump-victory in November.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two vertical grey bands correspond to these points in August and November. By following the bands downward, we can observe what the price of gold was the last time the mining sector was valued near 25-26 on the GDX fund.</span>

<strong>The last two times the GDX traded between 25-26, gold averaged $1,305 per ounce.</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The gold mining complex is intrinsically related to the price of the metal itself, as the sector’s profits are derived largely from spot bullion prices. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Closing the week at $1,238 as of the last trade on the New York COMEX on Friday, the mining sector is already pricing in nearly a $67 per ounce increase in spot <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To further the case for the $1,300 gold target, we turn next to the latest action in silver.</span>
<h3><strong>Silver Analysis</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Friday, we note that gold’s cousin rose for the 8</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> week in a row last week, rising 0.5% or $0.10 cents to finish at $18.03 as of the final bid in New York.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We maintain a target of $18.75 for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, based on the amplitude ($1.50) of the bottoming pattern observed prior to the breakout above $17.25 in late-January. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be rare for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver price</a> to achieve a higher target without gold moving higher as well, and so the silver analysis that follows has direct implications for the $1,300 gold target referenced above.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1321 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/b_Silver-1024x766.png" alt="silver price forecast 2017" width="840" height="628" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the break above $17.25 two weeks ago, silver has been behaving near-perfectly from a technical standpoint. The rise has been steady yet slow, leaving further room to advance on the RSI indicator (top of chart) before an overbought signal is registered above a reading of 70.</span>
<h3><strong>On Trendlines</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an important point that traders may wish to note on the silver chart. Our typical analysis is based on best-fit trend lines, to use the term from statistical analysis. However, as the highs composing the upper trendline do not fit perfectly (no trend lines ever will), and as we are anticipating a breakout with some volatility along the way, it would also be wise to identify an absolute-highs trendline. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is indicated above on the silver chart by the lighter dashed blue line.  Using an absolute-highs trendline, the declining primary trend would come in closer to $18.20.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Which line is more relevant toward the breaking of silver’s downtrend and the establishment of a new period of rising prices?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, the breaking of a best-fit line is most critical.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the absolute highs line is important to keep in mind solely for the reason that some traders will be focusing on it. We should expect some traders to treat it as the defining trendline for the primary decline which began in July 2016. As such, some short-term selling pressure should be seen there.</span>

In due time, those sellers at $18.20 should be taken out during the upcoming advance toward $18.75 if our technical targets are to be met. From that point onward, we will have to re-assess the silver’s short-term setup.
<h3><b>Silver is Leading Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having broken through the best-fit trendline of the primary declining channel (royal blue), silver now finds itself directly challenging the absolute highs trendline. While grinding price action lasting up to 2 weeks could be expected underneath the absolute highs trend line, prices should be well-supported by the $17.25 support level (black line).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect that the absolute highs trend line will be broken within the next two weeks, and when it does, the advance toward the $18.75 target will be quick, needing only 3-5 trading days to reach this level. </span>

Please keep in mind that silver, being an extremely small market at only $20 billion in annual physical sales, is prone to overshoot technical targets – both to the upside and to the downside. Should silver exceed $18.75 on this move, a surge to $19.75 is not out of the question as an overshoot by mid-April.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we observe the price action around the next high, we will begin to gauge the potential for an intermediate retracement. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The price action of both metals is set to get increasingly volatile through 2017, but as the investment adage goes: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“with volatility comes opportunity”.</span></i>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price today $1,239.60 </i></b><b><i>(-0.20)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> Price $18.04 </i></b><b><i>(+0.01)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index 20,624.05 </i></b><b><i>(Today’s change 0.02%)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that the US is on holiday today in celebration of President’s Day, trading likely to be rather low-key throughout the session. There are also no economic reports scheduled for release today. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metals prices are little changed this  morning. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> keeps raising its ascent even with some stronger than anticipated economic data. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The coming months may be very telling in terms of what the Trump administration may be able to accomplish. Current geopolitical uncertainty surrounding the administration and U.S. relations with Europe, China, Mexico and elsewhere may keep a floor under the price of gold.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. markets are closed today due to the President’s Day Holiday. Market analytics are waiting for upcoming economic data this week ( Weekly Jobless Claims, New Home State, Consumer Sentiment etc.). Stocks remain not too far from recent highs, and could potentially go higher.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The political dynamics of Trump, Brexit and Eurozone elections make forecaster is likely to be based on the unpredictability that politics tends to produce. Time will tell how these events might affect global economics and the prices of precious metals.</span>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price decreased significantly to $1,229.80 </i></b><b><i>(-10.00)</i></b><b><i> per ounce today, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver </a>Price $17.96 </i></b><b><i>(-0.16)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index 20,682.26 </i></b><b><i>(0.28% raise)</i></b><b><i>.   </i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar outperformed in overnight trade as markets looked at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">weekly statistical releases scheduled </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of Fed commentary that may boost near-term rate hike speculation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar has not been able to drive the likes of EUR/USD and GBP/USD lower while at the same time maintaining just enough strength to ensure upside is limited.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of traders suggest that USD may have 6% upside against major currencies for the coming 1-2 month. As </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with a rising political risk in Europe, USD likely to strengthen in the medium and long term perspective. EUR may drop to 0.98 for the coming 6-12 months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metals did not do much moving on Monday, and this is mostly due to the fact that US markets were closed. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> spot price drops today but investors continue taking the opportunity to buy bullion as a hedge against political uncertainty in the United States and Europe. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For this week the most exceptional market update will likely be economic data release and investors are still a few weeks away from the FOMC meeting. Investors will be looking for any further clues as to the timing of additional rate hikes by the central bank as well as the Fed’s assessment of economic activity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The eleventh-hour agreement to grant continued Greek access to bailout funding initially boosted the EUR-USD exchange rate on Monday. Today profit-taking results on the open market brought investors skepticism back and largely eroded these gains. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today the US Dollar has jumped by 0.5% against the Euro. </span>

		<title>Daily Market Review- February, 23</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price hits up to $1,248.80 </i></b><b><i>(+14.70)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, Silver Price $18.27 </i></b><b><i>(+0.22)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index 20,814.20 </i></b><b><i>(0.19% raise)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar retains a positive bias but has given back some of its gains after two noted data releases came in below expectation. The dollar is higher ahead after the FOMC release on Wednesday. Currently, market investors suggest Dollar could be able to maintain its recent good form.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> prices on Thursday hit a three-month high after Federal Reserve policy meeting. The dampened expectations of an interest rate hike in March, lowering U.S. bond yields and stalling upward momentum in the dollar will influence the market in the following months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the weekly chart shows, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> has moved higher over the past eight straight weeks and it has posted a new short-term high in seven out of eight weeks. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, precious metals still face some challenges, growing optimism over the global economy continues to support equity markets.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most exceptional news of this week came from the latest FOMC meeting. U.S. stocks rose to fresh record highs on Thursday,  thanks to upbeat earnings reports from Wal-Mart and Home Depot. On Wednesday night, the Dow Industrial Average hit a new all-time closing high, marking a ninth straight session of record closes. The last time it registered a record-setting stretch of the same length was in 1987. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Market analytics want to see whether it includes more clues on the scope for a rate hike in March. More details on promised government spending, infrastructure investment or tax cuts would likely push the dollar and U.S. asset prices higher and gold lower. </span>

		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price hits up to $1,260.40 </i></b><b><i>(+8.30)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver</a> Price $18.43 </i></b><b><i>(+0.21)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index 20,772.04 </i></b><b><i>(38.28% decrease)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The USD dropped against all of its major counterparts after FOMC release. The US dollar index is also trading lower today. The U.S. dollar continued to struggle as investors sold the greenback, taking it lower against all of the major currencies. The problem lies in yields, which extended its losses despite relatively healthy U.S. data.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The precious metals look to end the week on a positive note after continuing to rally the past several trading sessions. Spot gold briefly touched as high as $1,260/oz overnight before moving back to about $1,255/oz due to some profit-taking this morning. The yellow metal is still trading about $5 per ounce higher in New York.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Stock Market Today </b></h3>
Even though U.S. analytics have been worried about the tightening, Fed fund futures show that investors are not convinced that the next rate hike will be in March.  So while we firmly believe that the greenback will trade higher, it may not catch a bid in the nearest future.]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[US Dollar & Long Bond Update]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar Index, which measures the US dollar versus a basket of foreign currencies, is still perched precariously just above the breakout point of its 2015-2016 consolidation. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Closing the week at 101.1, the dollar must remain above 99.5 on the Index in order to avoid an extremely-bearish reversal pattern, which is tentatively taking the shape of a Head &amp; Shoulders top formation (blue callouts).</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1361" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1a-1024x609.png" alt="US Dollar Index " width="840" height="500" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial surge in the dollar seen immediately following Trump’s presidential victory was accompanied by a sentiment which suggested the new administration would reverse trade deficits, boost growth, and cut the US national debt. Yet the sluggishness of the dollar’s advance in recent weeks suggests that the market is having second thoughts about this initial determination.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From a sentiment standpoint, a bearish outlook for the dollar seems to be a possibility few in the mainstream media are contemplating – and for that reason, it represents a compelling contrarian viewpoint.</span>
<h3><b>Euro Fears? The Contrarian Stance</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, reports regarding the possible breakup of the euro-zone <img class="wp-image-1362 alignright" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1.png" alt="Bankers prepare for eurozone break-up risk. Financial Times" width="365" height="333" />have reached almost a fever-pitch, following the UK’s decision to leave the EU last June and uncertainty regarding elections across mainland Europe in 2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems “everyone” knows the euro is set to disintegrate over the next few years – and for that reason, we believe the trade is extremely crowded. As contrarians, when everyone knows that something is set to happen, we must at least ask the question: “Is there not an alternate possibility?”</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1363" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2.png" alt="Euro zone break-up fears back on the table with Italy expected to reject reforms" width="304" height="311" />While the Euro-zone clearly has a unique set of political/economic problems and may need substantial reforms, we must consider the possibility that most of this “news” is already priced in the currency.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, the fact that most investors are convinced of the euro’s imminent collapse leads us to strongly favor the stance that the euro is set to begin a multi-year advance. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And if the euro is nearing the start of a significant advance, the dollar should act conversely. As the largest component of the Dollar Index above is the euro (at 57%), a rising euro will cause the dollar to fall.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All else being equal, a falling dollar will tend to cause more investors to seek protection in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not want to call the top in the dollar prematurely, i.e. before we see a breakdown below 99.5 on the Dollar Index. However, the US currency is acting significantly weaker than it “should” be acting, given the two-year consolidation is seen prior to the breakout. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Something is not right with the way the dollar is behaving technically. If it does not manifest immediately, our best assessment is that dollar weakness should become evident by 2018.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Bonds</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonds represent US dollars to be received in the future. We continue to suspect that a generational timeframe top has been put in on long-dated US bonds. Shown below is the price of the US 30-year bond. Recall that the price of bonds moves opposite to yields, and so a record-high price equates to record-low yields.</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1364" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/3.png" alt="The price of the US-30 year bond" width="1015" height="603" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From a technical standpoint, tops after long-term advances tend to be characterized by an orderly advance which then becomes disorderly. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/01/09/us-bond-bubble-cracking/">US bonds</a>, we had observed an unprecedented 36-year advance in price, defined by an orderly (magenta color) rising channel from 1980 – 2016. The advance in bonds then became disorderly, taking on characteristics of a parabolic blow-off, and breaking the upper trend boundary (shown in blue, above). The top saw a price of 175 on the 30-year bond, which corresponded to a record low yield of 2.1%.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the blow-off, we observed a quick 17% drop in bond prices in 2H 2016. Such a quick drop from an all-time high suggests an initial exhaustion sell-off after an unsustainable advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are not expecting a collapse in bond prices immediately; however, if the above analysis is to remain valid, the 30-year yield at 2.1% should not be matched again – perhaps ever again in our lifetimes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following 36 years of rising bond prices, it is equally fathomable that the bond market could see 36 years of falling prices, corresponding to 36-years of rising interest rates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors had become accustomed to buying bonds for safety over the last generation. Years of falling bond prices should represent an important component of the long-term thesis for precious metals, as some of that safety-seeking capital that in the past would flow to bonds will be diverted in the future toward gold.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The size of the US bond market alone is estimated to be near $12 trillion. Meanwhile, at $1,300 per ounce, all of the gold ever mined in the history of the world is valued at $6.6 trillion (and nearly 50% of that gold is held in jewelry, mostly in Asia). We can see that it would not take a huge percentage of capital to flow from bonds to gold to cause a major price acceleration in the precious metals. </span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - February, 28</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price decreased slightly to $1,258.40 </i></b><b><i>(-1.30)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> Price $18.48 </i></b><b><i>(+0.02)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones index 20,818.55 </i></b><b><i>(-0.09 % decrease)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday precious metals opened day trading in much the same way they were through the last week. Helping precious metals for yet another trading session was a weaker US Dollar. Silver opened this week at $18.00 USD per ounce and experienced very little movement in price until late in the week. Gold received support from a positive global trend and didn’t  have any significant changes at the beginning of the week. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With any impact from Trump's economic policies, investors are focused on whether current growth is strong enough to lead the U.S. Fed to raise rates in the near future.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors are also awaiting President Donald Trump's speech addressed to a joint session of Congress tonight. So far there is little sign that the new President's legislative agenda will include repealing and replacing Obamacare, a big tax overhaul, and a trillion-dollar infrastructure military program, that could influence <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> price immediately.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stock futures were flat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this morning after the Dow pushed its record high close streak to 12 sessions, its longest winning streak since 1987. Markets edged higher in the previous session. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 hit fresh intraday highs. There are also lots of data on the calendar for this week. U.S. economic growth was a bit worse </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">than expected in the second estimate for the fourth quarter, with robust consumer spending offset by downward revisions to business and government investment. Most stock market analysts worry how fast  the U.S. economy would continue its "miraculous" boom. </span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price decreased to $1,233.60 </i></b><b><i>(-1.31%)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> Price $17.71 </i></b><b><i>(-3.67%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price">Platinum</a> Price $985.00 </i></b><b><i>(-2.86%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price">Palladium</a> Price $767.00 </i></b><b><i>(-0.90%)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones Index 21,065.77 </i></b><b><i>(0.24 % decrease)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, gold suffered one of its worst trading days in this year due to a stronger US Dollar that is trading firmer by hitting another six-week high. Silver hit a three-week low after a 3.5-month high on Monday. Gold and silver prices also fell by 1.31% and 3.67% due to an increased investor risk appetite and a growing notion that the FED will raise the interest rate at its upcoming FOMC meeting.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s first speech to Congress on Tuesday evening promised “massive” tax cuts for the US companies and middle class, and $1 trillion infrastructure investments, with no details about any health care reforms. The president basically reaffirmed his previous policy promises, which are expected to increase inflationary pressures.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After the President’s speech, investors now see a 65% chance that the FED will raise the interest rates later in March which will make the dollar rise. These growing expectations fueled the stocks rally on Wednesday. The hike in FED interest rates may also be pushed by a stronger labor market since FED is worried that the jobs market may overheat soon.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market backed off this morning after gaining record highs yesterday, as the Dow passed the 21,000 milestone and scored its best gains of the year. Investors caught their breath after the massive, record-breaking rally from Wednesday when they cheered the promises of infrastructure spending and tax reforms. After reaching 21,164.88 at 3 PM EST on Wed, 1st, the relief over Donald Trump’s message began to fade, and the Dow gave back 0.3% since it’s still not clear how the president will execute his plans.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Fed Hints at Rate Hike – How Will Gold Respond?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[I’ve long stated that the mainstream media consistently gets the relationship between gold prices and short-term US interest rates wrong. The charts clearly show over both recent and historical cycles, rising interest rates have corresponded with rising <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold prices</a> – not the opposite, as erroneously stated by the majority of the press.

For example, we’ve shown in the past the following two data sets: gold prices and short-term rates from both 2003 – 2007, and 1955 – 1980:

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1388" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/a_historic.png" alt="a_historic-fred-rates" width="1048" height="671" />

&nbsp;

In this case, the data as presented in the historic charts is extremely clear. And while we are officially told by the financial industry that <em>“past performance is no guarantee of future results” </em>when discussing historical trends, to completely disregard lessons from the past would be akin to saying <em>“past train arrival times are no guarantee of future train arrival times”</em> or <em>“past dinner prices are no guarantee of future dinner prices.”</em>

Sure, we cannot know <em>everything</em> about the future from studying the past. Things do change.

But we can know <em>something.</em>

And is not knowing something about what to expect in a given market better than not knowing anything?

&nbsp;

In this light, I continue <img class="alignright wp-image-1389" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b_Bloomberg.png" alt="bloomberg-gold-price" width="555" height="263" />to be amused and dismayed when I see articles such as this Bloomberg piece every time gold begins to get any attention in the mainstream press (see highlight circle):

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The article’s main point is that gold is behaving “counter-intuitively”, since it has risen after each of the Fed’s two interest rate hikes over the last year. The article goes on to state how rising interest rates are supposed to be positive for the dollar due to higher interest potential, and therefore negative for gold.

Does Bloomberg bother to look at the actual historic correlations between gold and short-term rates as we have shown above?

The main point of this editorial is to give an illustration of why I focus so heavily on charts and not on reported “fundamentals.” Many who believed the Fed would raise rates in 2015 for the first time in a decade stayed away from precious metals complex because they believed the fundamentals written in 99% of the mainstream financial press.

Even the respected economists all agreed on the fundamentals: rising rates are bad for gold.

The historic charts said otherwise.

As we observe the current cycle underway since December 2015, which form of analysis has been more accurate thus far?

&nbsp;

<img class="size-full wp-image-1395 aligncenter" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/c_recent.png" alt="recent-fred-rates" width="760" height="610" />
<h3><strong>Fed Hints of Coming Third Hike</strong></h3>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1396 alignright" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/d_Fed.png" alt="janet-yellen-puts-rate-hike-on-the-table" width="420" height="583" />

Friday was a fascinating case in point. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen gave a speech in Chicago Friday afternoon in which she strongly hinted that the US central bank would raise interest rates for the third time at this upcoming Fed policy meeting, scheduled for March 14-15. The most prescient quote from the speech follows:

<em>"We currently judge that it will be appropriate to gradually increase the federal funds rate if the economic data continue to come in about as we expect</em>. <em>Indeed, at our meeting later this month, the committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate</em>”.

Again, the standard narrative presented in the media is this: an increase in Fed-controlled interest rates should be US dollar-positive, as, all else considered, investors would increasingly choose to hold reserves in the US currency as interest rates rise, since they would be able to achieve a higher yield on these short-term deposits. This is the standard explanation for why rising interest rates should cause the dollar to strengthen, and hence precious metals to fall.

So if the above narrative were true, why did we observe the following reactions in the foreign exchange and precious metals markets immediately following Yellen’s speech? Let us look closely at the charts of both the US dollar index and gold on Friday.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1402" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/e_Fed_announcement.png" alt="fed-announcement-dollar-gld-index" width="904" height="797" />

&nbsp;

Notice that the US dollar fell after the hint of a rate hike, losing over 0.6% in just a few hours, while <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> rose nearly $8 in the two hours after the speech. <strong>This is the exact opposite to the pattern of trading that we are <em>supposed</em> to see with reference to Fed policy and major currency markets. </strong>The US dollar is <em>supposed</em> to rise and gold is <em>supposed </em>to fall on interest rate hikes.

The mainstream media has it flat-out wrong. Friday was a small example of that. Neither the dollar nor gold have behaved the way they are <em>supposed</em> to since the first Fed rate hike in nearly a decade, 15 months ago. We continue to see dollar weakness and gold strength appearing every time either a hint of a rate hike surfaces, or an actual rate hike is announced.

Considering that rates finished a 35-year falling cycle from the 1980 peak in 2015 and could reasonably be expected to be on a rising trajectory for many years or decades, this relationship is of utmost importance to get right.

Will the trend continue on March 15 if another rate hike is announced? We will know soon.

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price decreased to $1,226.70 </i></b><b><i>(-0.62%)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> Price $17.76 </i></b><b><i>(-1.03%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price">Platinum</a> Price $978.00 </i></b><b><i>(-1.81%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price">Palladium</a> Price $768.00 </i></b><b><i>(-0.52%)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones Index 20,923.04 </i></b><b><i>(0.39 % decrease)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A new Monday morning starts with a fresh look over markets by bringing you everything you need to follow up for making well-thought investment decisions during the next 5 days.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">FedChair's strong hint on Friday that the interest rate is expected to hike in March sent the prices of gold and silver down to $1,226.70 (-0.62%) and $17.76 (-1.03%) per ounce. This significant decrease confirmed their sensitivity to the future rising rates and the boosting dollar. Yet this week promises a series of events that shall further influence the spot prices for days and weeks ahead.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin’s supremacy continues on Monday, as the digital currency’s price overtook gold last week, gaining more than 60% since the mid-January. This is another step for Bitcoin, as by the end of this week it may acquire its exchange-trade fund, but market experts are still skeptical that this will happen.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the biggest news will come on Friday as the Bureau of Labor Statistic should present a strong jobs report that is expected to justify the Fed’s hike of the short-term interest rates. One of the biggest worries regarding the Fed’s new tight policy is that it will be the first among its international peers which are still loose. Though, if the European Central Bank will express its intention of normalizing the money supply during its Thursday meeting, this may sustain the Fed’s decision of a higher interest rate.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US stock market started the week mostly lower, giving a quieter beginning to the trading week, with a 0.39% decrease in the Dow Jones index. Investor’s appetite for risk was curbed by Trump’s accusation that the ex-President of the US, Barack Obama, wiretapped him, as well as the latest geopolitical tensions happening in Asia. Some investors are worried that these accusations may distract Trump from his economic agenda that powered the last week’s record-rally.</span>]]></content>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price decreased to $1,214.40 </i></b><b><i>(-0.87%)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> Price $17.49 </i></b><b><i>(-1.49%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price">Platinum</a> Price $958.00 </i></b><b><i>(-1.84%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price">Palladium</a> Price $769.00 </i></b><b><i>(-0.26%)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones Index 20,934.70 </i></b><b><i>(0.09 % decrease)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong US dollar index and the future hike in interest rates work against the gold and silver market bulls making precious metals prices trade low. Gold hit a six-week low in the early Tuesday afternoon, decreasing by 0.87%, while the silver spot price is down with 1.49%, also hitting a four-week low.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, according to some market analysts, investors should not fear this lower trend, as gold may rally after FOMC meeting just like it did in December right after Fed’s latest rate hike. Besides, precious metals markets are still expecting one of the most important economic reports of the month – the Friday’s US February employment report from the Labor Department.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US stock market is in flux this Tuesday due to Trump’s vague promises on lowering drug prices and Republican’s bill that plans to tackle the health care reform. Dow Jones index fell by 0.09% while S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq lost 3.04 and 1.76 percentage points, continuing the quiet trading week.</span>]]></content>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The increasing idea of a hike in the US interest rate next week makes the US dollar index trading near steady again this Thursday morning, after hitting its highest level in five days on Wednesday. Gold and silver prices continue to struggle, decreasing with and 0.38% and 1.16%, and hitting their five-week lows.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the European Central Bank (ECB) held its regular monetary policy meeting during which it decided to leave the policy unchanged. However, the entire market is awaiting the February employment report presented tomorrow by the Labor Department and the next week’s FOMC meeting. Investors see a 90% chance that the FED is fully expected to raise the interest rates with 0.25%.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following ECB’s decision to maintain its loose monetary policy and raise its growth forecasts, stocks rose, although off their earlier highs. Dow Jones Index increased with 0.02% while NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 went up with 0.03% and 0.04%. While the traders digest the latest ECB monetary policy decision and data, Wall Street celebrates its 8th anniversary in a bull market today, the 2nd longest since the World War II. Though, investors are cautious, looking ahead to the February’s US jobs report which must be released tomorrow and shall confirm a strong employment rate.</span>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Gold & Silver Technical Updates]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<strong>Gold Analysis</strong>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> price fell for the second week in a row last week, down $25 or 2.1% from a week prior. The final print on the NY COMEX futures exchange was $1,201 as of Friday afternoon.

Minor support at $1,220 was lost this week, and we expect this area will act as short-term resistance on the next advance.

Further minor support should be seen at $1,180.

Unless you are a short-term trader (for which we encourage utmost caution in the current technical backdrop) we want to draw your attention away from these minor support levels and toward <strong>the primary converging pattern which must resolve itself by Q3 – Q4 of this year</strong>. That is: the converging of the 2011 – 2017 long-term downtrend (magenta color) and the new rising support line (royal blue) which began in 2015.

Short-term gyrations will take on less and less significance as the two primary trends converge and until one of the trends gives way. When two converging trends meet on a chart, one of them must necessarily break in favor of the other. The outcome typically results in a strong move in the direction of the breakout, as illustrated below by the green arrows.

Based on the trajectory of the trends now developing, this break in one direction or another will occur no later than November, as the trends reach an apex convergence. However, based on past years of observing these patterns, it is generally more likely that the pattern will resolve itself at least 2-3 months prior.

To gauge the likely outcome, we will be watching supporting indicators from silver, the mining sector, the broad commodity complex, and currency cross-pairs over the months ahead.

For the time being, we will be closely monitoring <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> action in the world’s historic store of wealth over the days immediately following this week’s Fed interest rate announcement, due Wednesday afternoon.

&nbsp;

<strong>Silver Analysis</strong>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver price</a> fell 4.6% or $0.82 cents for the week to close at $16.92 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.

Although the price has fallen below anticipated support near $17.25, the message of this market is of a retest of the broken primary declining (blue) channel. The breakout came five weeks ago (red callout), and it is common for retests of broken declining channels to occur at a lower price point than the original breakout, due to the fact that the channel is necessarily falling.

By falling rapidly for six out of the last seven trading days, silver has approached oversold status on the RSI indicator (top of chart), indicating a short-term bottom (at minimum) is due.

We expect <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> will be making a bounce from this channel retest, shown by the green callout, on the way to challenging resistance near $18.50 over the next month.

The downtrend breakout would be considered to have failed – a bearish sign that a deeper low is in store for the future – if prices fall more than $0.30 cents further and definitively re-enter the declining channel.

		<title>Daily Market Review - March, 13</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price decreased to $1,204.30 </i></b><b><i>(-0.02%)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> Price $16.95 </i></b><b><i>(-0.38%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price">Platinum</a> Price $938.00 </i></b><b><i>(-0.32%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price">Palladium</a> Price $753.00 </i></b><b><i>(+0.94%)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones Index 20,876.23 </i></b><b><i>(0.13 % decrease)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday mornings start with a fresh look over markets. Follow up the latest events to make well though investment decisions during the next week. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar index begins the trading week slightly higher, continuing its price uptrend. Gold and silver spot prices settled down, being modestly higher in the early trading Monday, and breaking the previous 6-week streak of losses. These minor upside price corrections on the market are influenced by the future FOMC meeting this week.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last Friday, the Bureau of Labor reported that the US economy added 253,000 jobs in February (much more than the estimated 190,000), the unemployment rate decreased to 4.7 % and the average hourly earnings increased by 2.8 on an annualized basis. The report sets the stage for this week’s main event – the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the meeting, it’s widely expected that the FOMC will approve a quarter-point hike in its interest rate, the third in just a decade, which should boost borrowing costs across the economy. Fed officials don’t hide their desire to move the rate closer to a reasonable level after an extended period of holding it back because of the financial crisis.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of the last week, the stock market moved higher after traders digested the Friday’s crucial jobs report, indicating a 100-points gain of the Dow Jones Index. This Monday morning, the market was moving rather flat to slightly higher, flagging the traders’ preparedness for the very likely increase in the interest rate later this week. Therefore, the US stock market stays focused on Trump’s administration promises of pro-growth policies.</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price decreased to $1,203.20 </i></b><b><i>(-0.04%)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> Price $16.90 </i></b><b><i>(-0.32%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price">Platinum</a> Price $937.00 </i></b><b><i>(-0.11%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price">Palladium</a> Price $744.00 </i></b><b><i>(-1.33%)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones Index 20,835.59 </i></b><b><i>(0.22 % decrease)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar index traded about 0.3% higher this morning while gold and silver prices are slightly lower, decreasing with 0.04% and 0.32%. However, gold and silver trading is still steady after their multi-week streak of losses. The focus of the precious metal market is the upcoming meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the heavy snow storm hitting the US eastern seaboard, the two-day meeting of Fed’s policymaking committee starts today and investors are eagerly waiting for its conclusion. The strong February jobs report presented on Friday is the final confirmation for the Fed that the time had come to raise the interest rates to prevent the US economy from overheating.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the rate is expected to stay below 1%, the Federal Reserve’s move still comes months earlier than markets expected due to the continuously improving economic conditions. Fed officials state that the move is not a political message towards Trump’s determination to stimulate the economic growth. However, it’s clear that Fed’s essential point is that it doesn’t want a faster growth.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US stock market had a lower opening this Tuesday morning as the traders are quietly anticipating the FOMC’s conclusion on Wednesday. Traders are focused not only on its interest rate hike but also its forecasts for economic growth and inflation. The Dow Jones Index is down with 0.22%, NASDAQ and S&P both decreased by about 0.4%. Besides, the blizzard may also temporary freeze major market actions, sustaining today’s quieter trading in the US stock market.</span>]]></content>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold</i></b></a><b><i> Price increased to $1,211.60 </i></b><b><i>(+1.08%)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> Price $17.09 </i></b><b><i>(+1.45%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price">Platinum</a> Price $941.00 </i></b><b><i>(+0.64%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price">Palladium</a> Price $749.00 </i></b><b><i>(+1.08%)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones Index 20,904.91 </i></b><b><i>(0.32 % increase)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday morning, the US dollar index traded slightly lower while the silver and gold prices got up, increasing by 1.08% and 1.45%. The precious metals market is still quiet, anticipating this afternoon’s conclusion of the Fed’s policymaking committee meeting, but some analysts state that gold and silver prices may rally after its decision.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee (FOMC) began on Tuesday and shall end this afternoon with a conclusion about its policy. It’s widely expected that the Fed will conclude to raise the interest rates by 0.25% today, but investors are more focused on future increases that may come by the end of this year, as well as their potential impact on the markets.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As traders are waiting for today’s approval of the interest rate hike, the US stock market had a higher opening this morning. Dow Jones Index is up 0.32%, S&P 500 increased 0.45% and NASDAQ rose 0.35%. Today, FOMC shall announce its 2nd interest rate hike in three months and the 3rd in ten years, but most important, Fed will also release its updated forecasts that may include three further rate hikes this year.</span>]]></content>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,225.80 </i></b><b><i>(+0.50%)</i></b><b><i> per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver Price</a> $17.29 </i></b><b><i>(-0.20%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price">Platinum Price</a> $955.00 </i></b><b><i>(+0.32%)</i></b><b><i>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price">Palladium Price</a> $766.00 </i></b><b><i>(+0.79%)</i></b><b><i>, Dow Jones Index 20,934.55 </i></b><b><i>(0.07 % decrease)</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar index traded slightly slower, hitting a one-month low after Fed’s announcement of an increased interest rate. However, a weaker dollar has helped to rally the gold market, moving the gold price up by 0.50% to $1,225.80 per ounce. Silver spot price is down by 0.20% after hitting $17.58 per ounce earlier this session. Overall, precious metals prices ended the Thursday session sharply higher, reviving after a two-week meltdown in prices.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As it was widely anticipated, Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee concluded its two-day meeting yesterday by increasing its interest rate with 0.25%, setting Fed on a likely path of several regular hikes ahead. The Federal Reserve is expected to hike 2 more times this year, most probably in June and December, although the market was expecting four rate hikes in 2017.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As Fed confirmed its decision to increase the interest rate the second time in three months, the US stock market opened higher this morning. However, Dow Jones Index slightly decreased by 0.07% and S&P down with 0.16% while NASDAQ slightly rose by 0.01%, influenced by a selloff in health care which challenged the optimism from the increased rates.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Fed Rate Hike Results in Successful Silver Retest</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

If you have been reading this column for some time, you may have noticed that technical analysis can often show us the “what” ahead of time, but the exact “why” trigger typically remains to be seen.

In this instance, let us turn to the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> market, which has continued, over the last three months, to behave more precisely on a technical pattern basis than <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week we noted that the swift decline from $18.50 back down to $16.75 over the previous seven trading days constituted a retest of the breakout seen during the first week of February. The breakout occurred as prices exceeded the upper boundary of the price channel that defined the July 2016 to February 2017 decline. Subsequently, the fall seen through Wednesday of last week constituted a retest of that broken channel. Please refer to the turquoise lines on the chart below, along with the annotations for the breakout and retest:</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1476" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3.20-1024x766.png" alt="Primary Declining Trend " width="840" height="628" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, the charts can often tell us “what” is likely to happen, but the “why” usually remains to be seen.</span>

In  this case, it happened once again to be the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday which provided the bounce from the retest we anticipated on the charts. The 0.25% rate hike announced by the Fed on Wednesday was indeed met with weakness in the US dollar, and inversely strength in the precious metals complex -- most clearly seen on the silver chart above.

In sum, for the week silver rose 2.9% or $0.49 cents to close at $17.41 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX futures market.
<h3><b>Silver’s Primary Downtrend - Broken</b></h3>
Our charts change periodically as new information becomes available. In the above <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> chart, we have new information as to where large buyers are showing up – now visible just above $16.75 in the spot market.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned, the primary declining channel from July 2016 through February 2017 has been changed to the turquoise color (see color key, chart above). In this system of analysis, turquoise represents broken trendlines. Broken trendlines </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be kept in our minds for at least several months following a successful breakout – precisely for the reason that they are often retested by traders some point into the future.</span>

By changing the color of the trendlines from royal blue to turquoise (once broken), it allows a quick visual perspective that still recalls the former trend but does not distract from the newly emerging primary pattern.

In the case of silver, we have a new primary trendline, which must be drawn from the December 2015 low at $13.65 per ounce up to the December 2016 low at $15.75 per ounce. This is shown by the new dashed royal blue line on the chart. With two significant higher lows occurring exactly one year apart, we can now begin to define the support and resistance levels which will be important for silver for at least the remainder of 2017, and likely well beyond.
<h3><b>On Trendline Retests</b></h3>
Note that silver’s breakout from its primary down channel occurred in early February at $17.25 (red callout), and the retest of the same down channel occurred five weeks later, at $16.75 (green callout).

It should be apparent now the value in monitoring these technical trends.

Those who were not following this primary trend in such a manner since July likely would have experienced more fear during the recent quick correction which ended last week.

As we instead saw the correction as a retest of the broken trend channel, much of the potential fear was avoided.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those interested in applying this form of technical analysis, note that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">retests of downward trends may indeed occur at lower price points than their original breakouts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This type of lower retest can scare those investors who are only focused on the absolute price without regard to trend analysis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot get every single twist and turn correct every time, but as any traveler who has ever been lost in a new land without a map or compass will tell you: “Having some information is infinitely better than having none at all.” This has been our experience over many years of observing the precious metals – the charts are valuable maps that we have to guide us.</span>
<h3><b>Silver Going Forward</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, we reiterate that silver has successfully retested its second-half 2016 primary declining trend. Initial support should be seen between $16.75 - $17.25 on any weakness, labeled on the chart above. In a worst-case scenario, we could observe a second-retest of the aforementioned broken trend channel, in the price region of $16.50, which would correspond with the rising primary (blue) trendline from the December 2015 bottom.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our highest probability scenario at this juncture is that silver will begin to advance to challenge the February highs near $18.50, labeled Initial Resistance on the chart, at which point we will need to monitor related signals to gauge the possibility of a further advance toward the 2016 highs near $21.</span>

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,234.80 (+0.33%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.48 (+0.29%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $970.40 (+0.27%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $782.65 (+0.59%), Dow Jones index 20,936.39(0.10 % increase).</i></b>

A new Monday morning starts with a fresh look over markets by bringing you everything you need to follow up for making well thought investment decisions during the next 5 days.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S.Dollar suffered a bad previous week and its technical situation is looking increasingly dubious this week, slightly boosting a gold price. This week’s US economic data calendar is a relatively thin one, but the combination of the latest economic updates and market situation speaks for itself.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Durable Goods Orders on March 24, Friday, are the focus of this week for the U.S. Dollar although they are unlikely to cause much volatility according to Raiffeisen Research, who see a rise in orders for aircraft from Boeing offset by a fall in general capital goods buying.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The week ahead is thin on top data flow, putting the spotlight on a docket of scheduled commentary from Fed officials. Comments from Chair Yellen and Neel Kashkari – the President of the central bank’s Minneapolis branch. Kashkari is a new voting member, so investors will be hoping he provides some clarity on his decision for no change</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kashkari is scheduled to speak Thursday at the Community Development Research Conference in Washington. Fed Chair Janet Yellen will deliver the opening remarks at the conference. Besides that, seven other Fed policymakers are due to speak.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The economic data also includes House vote on the repeal of Obamacare on Thursday. The majority of experts suggest that bill are not particularly important for the market, and even if it does pass, the bill could see modification in the Senate. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Seems like this week market data will give traders some pause with a relatively light economic calendar.</span>]]></content>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar is in a soft patch at present.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, it doesn’t mean precious metals will trade much higher, but it does mean they will likely at the least hold a bid if the dollar continues to slide. Meanwhile, some experts have an opinion that the current pullback is only temporary and that the U.S. Dollar will rise again. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors have been surprised by the currency's performance since the Federal Reserve announced an interest rate rise earlier in March. The main reason for the under performance is that investors are selling the Dollar as an expression of disappointment after the Fed suggested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> markets should only expect two further interest rate rises in 2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Market analytics look forward the several Fed members speaking this week which will tend to impact the near-term directional bias for the dollar.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock Market opens higher today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 46 points (0.3 % ) today, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">S&amp;P 500 2,366.98 (0.28% decrease) and NASDAQ Index 5,833.52 (0.30% decrease).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks showed a lack of direction on Monday and closed the day little changes. On the economic front, New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley is going to speak at two events today. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Early trading in U.S. Future Index suggests that Wall Street will open higher on Wednesday. </span>]]></content>

		<title>Introducing the 1st Palladium American Eagle. Low mintage -15,000 coins.</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The release of the first </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-1-oz-palladium-american-eagle-25-coin-bu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 1 oz Palladium American Eagle $25 Coin BU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a significant moment in American coinage, which will take the most recognized and demanded <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins/gold-american-eagle/gold-eagles">American Eagle series</a> into the new field of the precious metals industry. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seven years of studies and development, the US Mint announced that it will launch its first ever</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Palladium American Eagle in September 2017. One of the rarest precious metals on the market-palladium will join the </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-1-oz-silver-american-eagle-bu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">silver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-1-oz-gold-american-eagle-bu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gold</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-w-1-oz-platinum-american-eagle-proof-coin-w-box-coa">platinum</a> versions of the famous American Eagles line. This new program will be the first major change to the Eagle program since the release of </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-w-1-oz-platinum-american-eagle-proof-coin-w-box-coa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platinum American Eagle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1997.</span>
<h3><b>The history of the first </b><b>US Mint Palladium Eagle</b></h3>
The US Congress authorized the production of the first Palladium Eagle under the American Eagle Palladium Bullion Coin Act of 2010. The newest American Eagle is an extension of the American Eagle bullion series.  According to this Act, the coin will be stuck in several versions: Uncirculated, Bullion and Proof.

After the Congress passed the Act, the Treasury Secretary commissioned an independent third-party study ascertaining the market demand for the new palladium coin. The findings of this study were submitted to the Secretary in 2013 and were supposed to conclude over the economic feasibility of the coins’ mintage, hence determining their availability.

Public Law also includes an option for the U.S. Mint to strike American Palladium Eagles in collector proof and uncirculated qualities. If a proof is made, the law requires that they come from the West Point Mint.
<h3><b>What makes the </b><b>2017 Palladium American Eagle</b><b> so special?</b></h3>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>It’s the 1</b><b>st</b><b> official </b><b>US Mint palladium coin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Only a few mints around the globe use rare palladium in their bullion </span>production, <span style="font-weight: 400;">making the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palladium American Eagle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a highly exclusive coin.</span></li>
 	<li><strong>Only 15,000 coins minted! </strong>This is a very low mintage, and the coins are likely to be sold fast.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>It carries one of the Nation’s most beloved designs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - the “Winged Liberty” considered to be a major factor that will increase the popularity of the coin. This is one of the most beautiful designs ever minted in American coinage.</span></li>
 	<li><strong>A Proof version of the coin will be struck in 2018</strong> at the West Point Mint and bear "W" Mint mark. It will have the same design as the 2017 bullion version.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1524" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2.jpg" alt="Palladium American Eagle" width="805" height="450" />
<h3><b>The famous “Winged Liberty” design.</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The obverse side of the coin features the rendition of one of the most attractive designs ever featured in US mintage. Originally created by Adolph A. Weinman for the ‘Mercury Dime”, the “Winged Liberty” is considered as one of the most graceful artworks among collectors around the globe.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1523" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1.jpg" alt="Palladium American Eagle" width="401" height="401" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Struck from 1916 to 1945, the coin was called “Mercury Dime” due to its similarity to the Roman God Mercury. The artwork showcases the profile of Liberty wearing a Phrygian cap – a symbol of power and freedom.  Inscriptions include “LIBERTY,” “IN GOD WE TRUST,” and “2017".</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The coin’s reverse showcases another creation of A. Weinman, first designed in 1907 for the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Gold Medal. The artwork presents an eagle sitting on the rock and pulling a large tree branch. It is one of the most impressive and admired reverse designs in many years of American coinage history. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1522" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3.png" alt="Palladium American Eagle" width="480" height="480" />

The proof and uncirculated versions will also display a mintmark.
<h3><strong>2017 Palladium Eagle Program Development. </strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Mint has worked on securing a reliable list of vendors which shall provide sufficient palladium blanks that meet the Mint's specifications. The blanks must have sufficient dimensions to ensure the successful high relief rendition of the reverse and obverse designs. The diameter of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 Palladium Eagle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shall be between 32.7 mm (the diameter of the gold version) and 38.1 mm (the diameter of the commemorative silver coin). Each </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Palladium Eagle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coin will be issued with a face value of $25, being legal tender in the United States, and will contain 1 oz. of .9995 fine palladium.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before any of the coins may be produced, the Secretary of the Treasury must commission an independent third-party marketing study into the possible demand for the strikes. The U.S. Mint began researching potential palladium suppliers in 2016. However, the authorizing legislation requires the bullion version of a palladium American Eagle to be produced at any facility other than the West Point Mint. The research and development of the palladium American Eagle were carried in the Philadelphia Mint, where the developmental strikes for a palladium American Eagle bullion coin will be struck using dies based on artwork, which was approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
<h3><b>When will Palladium American Eagle be available?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">First Palladium American Eagle will be launched in September 2017. Like other U.S. Mint bullion, the American Palladium Eagle will be sold in a limited time range on US Mint network and then distribute to authorized retail dealers like </span><a href="https://trustedpmdealers.com/site/outside-redirect/https%253A%252F%252Fbullionexchanges.com%252F"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bullion Exchanges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The United States Mint has never issued a coin struck in pure palladium; this bullion is expected to be one of the most anticipated US Mint releases ever. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2018-w-1-oz-proof-palladium-american-eagle-25-coin-w">2018-W 1 oz Proof Palladium American Eagle $25 Coin</a> will be available at the beginning of 2018.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t miss a chance to buy </span><a href="https://trustedpmdealers.com/site/outside-redirect/https%253A%252F%252Fbullionexchanges.com%252F2017-1-oz-palladium-american-eagle-25-coin-bu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 1 oz Palladium American Eagle $25 Coin BU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on our website. </span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - March, 22</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,248.70 (+0.36%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.61 (-0.05%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $966.50 (-0.48%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $790.15 (+0.89%), Dow Jones index 20,637.33 (0.15 % decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar continues to undergo a period of corrective selling pressures having lost points against other currencies. The US dollar index is down by 0.6% on Wednesday morning. This is the lowest level for the index since early February.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> price keeps increasing, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> was trading lower in an early market opening on Wednesday on account of subdued demand of precious metals from jewelers, investors, and industries. Traders believe that the gold price will go upper, especially following indications from the US Federal Reserve this week. Gold usually moves higher when there is fear, uncertainty, or volatility in markets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The big question at this point is how long this bout of weakness in the Greenback might last. By taking a ‘bigger picture’ look at the U.S. Dollar last months, we can see that price action is still bearish from the monthly chart analyse. Despite this, precious metals are still receiving a lot of support mostly thanks to the Fed’s recent decision to hike rates.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock Market opens lower today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 46.54 points (0.23%) today, S&amp;P 500 2,342.03 (0.10% decrease) and NASDAQ Index 5,798.86 (0.10% increase).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock indexes have moved backward at a fairly steady rate over the past 2 weeks. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">President Trump spent Tuesday selling the Republican health-care overhaul to skeptical House members, warning his party that failure would endanger his legislative agenda and their own political careers. Republican party leaders aim to move controversial healthcare legislation to the House floor for debate as early as Thursday this week. But they can only afford to lose about 20 votes from Republican ranks, or risk the bill failing since minority Democrats are united against it. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, some market participants attributed the slump in equities to fears that Trump’s legislative agenda as it pertains to Wall Street would face delays as the GOP-led health-care overhaul plans appeared set to struggle on congress.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors will keep an eye on speeches by several Federal Reserve officials this week for clues on the path of future interest rate hikes after the central bank last week raised rates for the first time this year.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - March, 23</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,253.40 (+0.37%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.75 (+0.79%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $969.60 (-0.25%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $804.95 (+1.78%), Dow Jones index 20,648.54 (0.06% decrease).</i></b>

&nbsp;

<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All of four precious metals (<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">palladium</a>) witnessed a rise in price on Thursday as the US dollar lost its points against the bucket of six major world currencies. Continuing to boost gold’s spot value is the fact that the US Dollar has been growing weaker and weaker this week. Investors suggest if the U.S. stock market does embark on a significant downside corrective move, the gold market would benefit appreciably.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of analysts believe that gold will continue to rise over the coming months. Although the consensus that the Fed will deliver only two further rate hikes this year, Fed members may be forced to talk tougher in the second half of the year, which could tighten yields and lead to a stronger US dollar. For now, a dovish Fed is likely to support gold.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Stock Market Today</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock Market is barely moving today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 12.76 points (0.06% decrease), S&amp;P 500 2,349.52 (0.05% increase) and NASDAQ Index 5,822.25 (0.01% increase).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today a big vote taking place in the US House of Representatives, the House will be voting on whether or not to abolish the Affordable Care Act, also commonly known as Obamacare. Wall Street eagerly await a vote on the House’s health care proposal, because that could be a barometer for future Trump administration policies.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, investors monitor oil prices, which continued falling after of the Energy Information Administration said U.S. inventories rose by 5 million barrels last week.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Global market experts argued yesterday that the market could fall after a terrorist attack in London, one of the world's financial capitals, largely in their stride. But stocks held their ground on Thursday and don’t show any lasting reaction to the latest European terror attack.The focus is still on how much of the risk rally is predicated for the global market on future Trump policy.</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,249.30 (+0.16%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.72 (+0.28%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $971.50 (+0.53%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $815.65 (+1.48%), Dow Jones index 20,692.46 (0.17% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> rose up a bit on Friday, and keeps looking stronger in the near-term because of the weak U.S. Dollar. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">Platinum</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> also open market today with a small change. The U.S. dollar keeps turning lower against other major currencies on Friday, as investors remained cautious ahead of a delayed vote on U.S. President Donald Trump’s healthcare bill on Thursday and as strong euro zone data sent the U.S. currency lower.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the FOMC interest rate announcement was made last week, gold and silver have been gaining value at a fairly steady rate. The precious metals complex enjoyed a strong week mostly due to the U.S. Dollar. The gold prices continue to trade near their range highs just below 1250 and the fact that they continue to trade strongly should be an encouraging sign for the bulls for the move towards the next target of 1260 in the gold prices.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock Market opens higher today: the Dow Jones Industrial Average gains 37.50 points (0.18% increase), S&amp;P 500 2,353.86 (0.33 % increase) and NASDAQ Index 5,849.52 (0.55 % increase).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The vote to replace Obamacare was delayed on Thursday as the Trump administration tried to bring dissenting Republicans on board. Trump has threatened to abandon the bill and leave Obamacare in place. Voting on health-care legislation is scheduled for late-afternoon Friday. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both stocks and bonds recorded gains this week, most precious metals prices also advanced this week. Global stock markets, including most in Europe and Asia, rose this week as fears of a rapid U.S. interest rate cycle dissipated. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Summarizing this week there were some actions that will impact the upcoming week, for gold and silver, the news was mostly positive despite the fact that spot values haven’t been changed intensively. </span>]]></content>

		<title>Inflation Outlook and Opportunity</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the central thesis for an emerging precious metals bull market revolves around an increased awareness by world citizens that the currencies they hold as savings are intrinsically worthless, any time we see significant weakness in a major currency we must place our attention there. And when the currency in question is the US dollar – the world’s reserve currency – the examination becomes even more prescient. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar has been weak recently, falling some 2.5% over the last two weeks. Suffice it to say, investors are having doubts that President Trump will be able to deliver on the promises of lowering taxes, increasing infrastructure spending, all while lowering the deficit. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more so, US dollar fundamentals are already “baked into the cake”, by which we mean this is the first time in world history that not a single currency is backed by anything tangible. As a result, world debt levels are at unprecedented highs, and the democratic system itself seems to dictate that politicians continue to print money to fund never-ending promises to their constituents. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexander Tytler, a Scottish judge from the 18</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century, summarized it succinctly, and we cannot disagree with him regarding the unsustainability of such a system:</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is always followed by a dictatorship.”</span></i>

&nbsp;

<img class="alignright wp-image-1553 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Article-1.png" alt="Percent changes in CPI for All Urban Consumers" width="497" height="485" /><b>Consumer Price Index</b>

We can see evidence for the continued debasement of the US currency all around.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent Consumer Price Index data (CPI), released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) a week ago, shows continued debasement in the form of a 2.7% annualized inflation rate across all items (red highlight circle). This means the value of money is declining by 2.7% per year – even above the Federal Reserve’s self-imposed mandate of a 2.0% inflation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While 2.7% per year might seem trivial, consider that 10-year Treasuries are yielding less than 2.4% per year, and a saver in a high-yield savings account would be lucky to earn 1.0% per year. These are negative real interest rates.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[A side note: entire books have been written on the inaccuracies in the BLS’s CPI statistics – in other words, the inflation statistics are generally under-reported. We do not disagree with these claims. For example, the BLS uses what is called ‘substitution’ in their methodology – meaning that if the price of wheat rises by a high amount due to inflation, the BLS will perform a substitution by assuming the average family will instead </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">consume corn. In this way they will leave out the price increase of wheat from the CPI statistics. This largely defeats the purpose of the CPI, which was originally designed to measure the price level of a stable basket of goods. Despite these flaws, the CPI is widely-discussed in the mainstream press, and it gives us at minimum an understated-baseline measure of inflation with which to examine trends.]</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, a 2.7% inflation rate, compounded, means the currency in question will end up losing half of its value every 26 years. So for a saver in US dollars, the Federal Reserve takes 50% of one’s purchasing power every generation through excessive printing of the currency.</span>
<h3><b>Money Supply</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We see further evidence for the relentless inflation through the Fed’s own data on M2 money stock. M2 is one of several metrics used by economists to measure the total quantity of dollars in existence, and it includes physical cash and coins, checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts. It is the broadest measure of money that is currently published by the Fed.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1554" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Article-2-1024x395.png" alt="M2 Money Stock" width="840" height="324" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Side note: an even broader measure of money supply, M3, was published by the Fed up until 2006. M3 included all of M2’s components, plus institutional accounts. The Fed stopped publishing M3 in 2006 claiming the costs were too high to compile and publish the data. This – from an agency that literally owns a printing press and can create money at will.]</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact remains that we live in a world in which monetary debasement is relentless by central banks, and this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has never happened on a worldwide basis in history</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In past inflationary periods, for example Germany during the Weimar hyperinflation of the 1920’s, citizens could protect themselves from rampant money printing by holding US dollars, which were backed and redeemable for 1/20 an ounce of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold </a>at that time.</span>

Presently, not a single currency is backed by anything tangible, and most central banks are engaged in similar policies as the Fed. The only place to turn if one desires to save hard money over time is precious metals.

The truth is, if we lived during a time of stable monetary systems, we would not want to invest in precious metals per-se. Precious metals would be money, or money would be backed by precious metals in redeemable form. One would thus hold precious metals as stable-value savings.

When an appropriate growth investment opportunity came about (such as a business, stocks, real estate, etc.), one would have the savings set aside and ready to invest. When he wanted to sell the investment, he would then convert it back into stable-value savings – precious metals.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But we don’t live in a world of stable values – we live in a world of consistently debased currencies. This presents one of the major challenges of our generation, but also one of the biggest opportunities.</span>
<h3><b>Opportunity – Is There Anybody Out There?</b></h3>
Opportunity arises when an individual sees something that the majority does not or cannot see. In the markets, we must have an opinion that is different from the sum of the other participants in order to make a profit.

If there was no difference in opinion between us and the market, there would be no opportunity for profit.

The opportunity to invest and to make a real return by ownership of precious metals exists because the majority of the world’s population does not yet recognize the unprecedented nature of the worldwide fiat system.

We can confirm this general lack of awareness by simple conversations with those in other communities. Step aside from any internet-based investment communities you may be involved with – and ask the average person you meet at a coffee shop or the grocery store or a bar if they have decided to allocate any savings to precious metals – the answer will almost always be “no.”

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most western citizens do not even know that it is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">possible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to own precious metals, let alone understand the relative merits of gold versus <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, various bullion products, or numismatics.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The point of this is that we must periodically disassociate ourselves from the niche communities we all participate in, and ask the question: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do the majority agree or disagree with us on the merits of owning physical precious metals versus fiat currency?”</span></i>

[If you can honestly answer that the majority of people agree with you and do own precious metals, please send a message to the editor, because I would like to know where this community is located. –C.A.]

Otherwise – as contrarians – we should celebrate the fact that very few people in western society see the value in holding precious metals, for herein lies the opportunity.

The opportunity exists because we disagree with the market at current prices. And if a small percentage of western citizens begin to agree with us – and then divert a portion of their savings into either gold or silver – the values of the metals will be forced upward by a factor of several multiples. There simply is not enough physical metal available for every household to move a portion of its assets into either physical gold or silver at today’s prices.

		<title>Daily Market Review - March, 27</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,261.40 (+0.24%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.17 (+1.43%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $985.30 (+0.68%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $807.20 (-0.75%), Dow Jones index 20,461.19 (0.66% decrease).</i></b>

A new Monday morning starts with a fresh look over markets by bringing you everything you need to follow up for making well thought investment decisions during the next 5 days.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> prices are up and hit a four-week high in early U.S. trading Monday. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver</a> prices hit a three-week high overnight. The US dollar has decreased over 2.5% the last two weeks and provided a great opportunity to invest in precious metals.  The market is still reacting to the news late Friday that the U.S. House of Representatives Republicans pulled their bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The major currencies outside US markets on Monday morning see the U.S. dollar index sharply lower and hitting a 4.5-month low overnight. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index is currently trading at 99.12, down 0.64% from Friday’s close and the worst level traded since mid-November 2016.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market pointed to a lower open on Monday, the major indexes hit their lowest levels in six weeks on Monday after Republican's pulled a healthcare bill: the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 58.67 points (0.28% decrease), S&amp;P 500 2,338.94 (0.22 % decrease) and NASDAQ Index 5,828.26 (0.01 % decrease).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock markets were unnerved last week by Trump's inability to get enough support for legislation to reform the U.S. healthcare system, a major 2016 election campaign promise of the president and his allies. The major investors suggest that politics, not economics, will be driving market moves for at least a couple of months ahead. So, the temporary focus on politics is perfectly understandable. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday likely to bring more talk and analysis of the fate of the GOP's American Health Care Act.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday brings Advance Goods Trade Balance, also Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak at a conference on Tuesday in Washington.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, on Wednesday the University of Michigan releases its monthly Consumer Confidence survey. The Pending Home Sales and mortgage applications will be also announced, which are essentially other measures of consumer confidence. Mortgage applications are expected to be lower, which is hardly surprising immediately following a rate hike, but actual new home sales are forecast to have increased by 1.8% in February.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday at 8:30 the February GDP data will be released.These numbers measure the actual growth in economic activity during February and given that the expectation for higher growth has driven most of the “Trump Rally” they will be closely watched this month.Also on Thursday, corporate profits numbers will be released. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday we will learn how much Americans have been making -when the Personal Income/Spending as well as PCE Price Index data will be released.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week’s numbers, therefore, will tell us more about the long-term effects of the new Trump policies.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - March, 28</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,259.10 (+0.28%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.25 (+0.32%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $968.40 (-0.36%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $789.85 (-0.13%), Dow Jones index 20,526.80 (0.12% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently trading around $1258, testing session tops, the precious metal's latest leg of up-move could be attributed to a modest US Dollar selling pressure. Silver was trading higher today, while the US dollar looking headed for lower prices.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There was hesitation with gold at resistance, but we gave a slight edge to a conviction in seeing a lower US Dollar Index (DXY) to at least keep precious metals buoyed in the near-term.  </span>What's truly important to realize is that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> stocks are, at this point, ready to shoot up, but the catalyst would be gold $1,300 and silver $19.00. Once this confirmation occurs, we will see a real change in the US market.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the US dollar was 19% higher versus the pound at 0.7978, flat versus the euro at 0.9207 and down 0.29% against the yen to 110.34 following heavy losses in the previous session after Republican leaders withdrew their support for his healthcare bill to repeal Obamacare last week.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts suggest that US Dollar has never been in greater danger of losing its dominant position as global reserve currency and payment standard.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market on Tuesday looked open track to open flat or slightly higher, despite a jump in oil prices: Dow Jones Industrial Average increased nearly 95.62 points (0.47% increase), S&amp;P 500 2,345.15 (0.36% increase) and NASDAQ Index 5,828.26 (0.19 % increase).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Commerce Department said in its advance economic indicators report on Tuesday that the goods deficit fell 5.9 percent to $64.8 billion last month as a decline imports outpaced a drop in exports. The U.S. goods trade deficit narrowed sharply in February, and inventories increased, which could prompt economists to raise their estimates for first-quarter. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Market participants are also waiting for speeches from Kansas City Fed President Esther George, Fed Chief Janet Yellen, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan and Fed Governor Jerome Powell, while Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer is due to be interviewed on CNBC.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - March, 29</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,253.90 (-0.19%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.22 (-0.38%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $956.80 (-0.04%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $788.30 (-0.90%), Dow Jones index 20,669.70 (0.15% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
Wednesday morning starts with a small breakdown in precious metals prices: all metals have bounced back slightly. Nevertheless, the move is relatively small and the session of US market is far from being over, it is definitely a very bearish sign. For now, today’s move is not something that changes the short-term outlook.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the morning reports the USD Index is testing higher to 99.65 bands today against major currencies. After 4-month lows in the mid 98.00s, the messages from Tuesday’s Fed-speakers collaborated with the upside impulse. </span>

Experts can consider a higher U.S. Dollar  Index today can be a negative sign for the precious metals, but additionally, if we focus on daily closing prices alone, then we can argue that there were actually no big changes at all.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold and silver prices did not lose too much ground in the today’s wake, but there is no clear way of determining whether today’s performance will translate into better performance for US Dollar throughout the second half of the week.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market opens higher on Wednesday, even the Dow Jones is turning a small drop: S&amp;P 500 2,359.70 (0.05% increase) and NASDAQ Index 5,885.72 (0.18 % increase), Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased slightly 48.81 points (0.24% decrease). </span>

The stock market news today is dominated by the  Brexit countdown as the UK’s ambassador to the economic bloc delivers the letter to the European Council in Brussels, announcing the United Kingdom’s withdraw from the European Union. The UK is the world’s fifth largest economy and there are serious concerns and ongoing debate about the likely impact on global business including the US market would be witnessed in the nearest future.

Wall Street is also waiting for the Consumer Confidence release. The first reports announced the pretty high results,  remaining an optimistic forecast that President Trump’s pro-growth  policies will go forward  despite a setback of the healthcare bill.

Oil prices were pushing higher  today after a large supply disruption in Libya. Still, traders will be eyeing a weekly inventory update from the Energy Information Administration on the state of crude stocks in the United State.

As we moving further into the week there is not many economic data forthcoming, but traders look forward to the GDP data release tomorrow and likewise the Personal Income/Spending report on Friday.]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - March, 30</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,250.60 (-0.24%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.27 (-0.27%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $957.60 (-0.61%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $788.30 (-1.04%), Dow Jones Index 20,736.70 (0.37% increase).</i></b>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>

Thursday morning started with a small breakdown of precious metals prices, with gold and silver prices moderately lower in the early U.S. trading day. The US Dollar extended its upside momentum today, briefly testing peaks above the 100.00 limestone, where it’s now looking to consolidate.

Dollar's strength during these last two days is probably more a function of the very strong US consumer confidence numbers, which the market saw earlier this week and the updates from the Fed in the past few days. Most Fed policymakers foresee at least two more increases this year. 

The index is seeing a solid rebound from a 3-month low hit earlier this week, and the bulls have gained some technical momentum.

<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>

US stock market opens higher on Thursday: S&P 500 2.369.88 (0.37% increase) and NASDAQ Index 5,916.28 (0.32 % increase), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20,736.70 (0.37% increase). The U.S. economic data due for release on Thursday includes the weekly jobless claims report, the final estimate of the fourth-quarter gross domestic product, and the fourth-quarter corporate profits data. Also, the February GDP data was released on this morning. 

The final fourth quarter GDP estimate upwardly revised the annualized growth number to 2.1% from the previous 1.9%. It also exceeded expectations of a 2.0% growth, coming on the back of a strong consumer spending which was associated with a rise in imports. Regarding weekly jobless claims, those fell to 258,000 during the previous week from 261,000 the week before. Despite the fall, the number of claimants has decreased less than expected, as forecasts pointed to 248,000 claims. The reading is below the 300,000 mark, that’s linked to a healthy jobs market for 108 weeks in a row.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,247.50 (+0.55%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.30 (+0.38%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $949.20 (-0.36%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $801.50 (+0.63%), Dow Jones index 20,686.85 (0.20% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar rose to a two-week high on Friday as a combination of technical trading and strong US economic data and potential weakness in the euro zone weighed down the continental currency. The U.S. dollar traded marginally higher against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.068 and the yen around 111.5.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metals, including silver, look poised to advance to higher levels. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> had a good week ending on Friday at the $1246 level, a gain of around $17 from the previous Friday's close. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver</a> ended yesterday flat, whereas palladium gained 0.63%, respectively.The overall sentiment in precious metals seems to be optimistic as global concerns keep piling up.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a  few global economic events play a substantial role in moving gold.The upcoming French election is causing uncertainty in Europe, which once again helps precious metals shine. In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Theresa May filed formal Brexit papers this week.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold and silver are still sitting pretty overall, at least for this time being.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market opens higher on Friday : S&amp;P 500 2,365.24 (-0.12%) and NASDAQ Index 5,908.62 (-0.10 %), Dow Jones Industrial Average  20,686.85 (-0.20%). </span>

March 31 U.S. stocks looked set to open slightly lower as investors prepared to lock in gains on what is likely to be Wall Street's strongest first-quarter performance in four years. US stocks looked to rebound after almost 2 weeks of fairly steady losses.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In economic news, Personal Income/Spending report was released today. The personal income rose 0.4 percent in February, in line with expectations, while consumer spending rose 0.1 percent, below an expected increase of 0.2 percent.</span>

On Friday, oil prices fell 0.8 percent after settling at its highest level in more than three weeks earlier. The commodity rallied after a weekly reading on domestic inventories showed a smaller-than-expected rise. Production disruptions in Libya also gave rise to crude prices.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive economic data in the way of GDP growth and declining jobless claims contributed to a buoyant overnight performance on Wall Street. In general positive US economic data drives market better this week.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - April, 3</title>
		<content><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,252.30 (+0.09%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.31 (-0.10%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $956.40 (+0.02%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $802.00 (+0.21%), Dow Jones index 20,639.30 (0.12% decrease).</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A new Monday morning starts with a fresh look over markets by bringing you everything you need to follow up for making well-thought investment decisions during the next 5 days. Here is not only new Monday for the markets, here is also a new month. </span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar started the week on a positive note on Monday as some lackluster US data and comments from Federal Reserve officials gave investors few catalysts to build on their US currency exposure.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar index, which tracks the US currency against a basket of six major rivals, was nearly  100.390 today. It notched a low of 98.858 last week, its weakest level since Nov 11, in the wake of US President Donald Trump's failure to pass a healthcare reform bill last month.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, investors are waiting for the economic events, that could push dollar more than in a previous month. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In March <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> prices were relatively stable keeping up around 1,247.30 and precious metals traders became more bullish on gold/<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> prices. However, the big picture of the precious metals is still indicative and uncertain . Investors  consider that this in April we may be ahead of another big rally in gold/silver prices.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market opened slightly higher on Monday: S&amp;P 500 2,361.59 (-0.05%) and NASDAQ Index 5,914.29 (+0.04 %), Dow Jones Industrial Average  20,658.52 (-0.02%).</span>

March was pretty hard and uncertain time for a market, the experts suggest that  the long-term prospects are looking up in coming month.

Here is a  list  of  top  events that likely to impact US market this first week of April:

On Thursday and Friday President Donald Trump meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping  and Trump already has predicted a “very difficult” meeting.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday the Cower and Co will host  its “Future of the Consumer” conference in New York. This event is full with the interesting presentations about the leading companies.</span>

On Wednesday, traders get Fed minutes from the last meeting of the FOMC, where the members voted to hike rates. This should provide little new insight.  This week, five Fed speakers can shed current light on the rate path ahead.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the European Parliament will debate a resolution on Brexit , the  US market hasn’t reacted much before, but now traders will keep  an eye on. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday evening investors are waiting for Friday's non-farm payrolls report.</span>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[US Dollar & Gold Technical Analysis]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar remains at a critical technical juncture, and as the currency typically has an overwhelming impact on gold prices over the short-term, we place our primary attention there this week. </span>

After seeming to break down during the overnight hours in Asia a week ago, the US dollar abruptly reversed and moved higher last week, finishing up 0.8 points to close at 100.2 on the dollar index.

The dollar is whipsawing traders at present and is caught immediately in the crosshairs of an important technical battle.

Despite the failure to follow-through in last week’s breakdown, the dollar remains within the zone of former support, which may now act as resistance, beneath 100.5 on the index. This zone is shown in black.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1616" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Image-1-1024x608.png" alt="US Dollar Index " width="679" height="403" />
<h3><b>Dollar Continues to Make Lower Lows</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The important point about the short-term technical picture is that </span><b>the dollar has now put in three separate lower lows</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (99.5, 99.2, and 98.8) since the breakout from the 2015 – 2016 consolidation. This is not the sign of a market prepared to make another multi-year advance. The bids at the retest lows we observe (below 99.5) are not enthusiastic; rather, they are fading as time progresses.</span>

In a strong breakout of a multi-year consolidation, we might indeed expect one or two retests of the former resistance zone. Yet following these retests, a market should move strongly higher to hit the consolidation target (which was calculated as 108 on the dollar index).

We have seen no such strength in the dollar since its breakout. Instead, we have seen three retests – each one occurring lower than the prior.
<h3><b>Could the Dollar Rally?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the dollar does somehow manage to rally at this juncture – perhaps by some jawboning statement by the Federal Reserve about a “strong dollar policy” – we expect the US currency could stage a marginal final rally toward the aforementioned 108 target. If this does materialize, </span><b>we expect to see precious metals not sell-off materially, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">but instead to show relative strength – perhaps consolidating with slight downward bias – as the dollar makes its terminal advance.</span>

Essentially, the precious metals should anticipate that the dollar is in the final stages of its advance, whether or not the exact top print has already been posted.

In retrospect – this is exactly what gold and silver have done thus far during the past 15 months. Gold is up nearly $200 and silver up $4.50 even as the dollar is just shy of a 9-year high. We suspect buyers have entered the precious metals market ahead of time, knowing that the dollar was approaching an important multi-year top.
<h3><b>Short-Term Technical Considerations</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The next few weeks continue to be critical to monitor for the dollar. On the chart above we can see that the US currency is now “sandwiched” between its rising (blue) trendline from the May 2016 low and its falling short-term trendline (teal) from the January high, all the while sitting squarely within the 2015 – 2016 resistance zone (black double lines). This is a tight technical situation indeed.</span>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Gold Analysis</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold advanced nominally last week, rising $2.70 or 0.2% to close at $1,251 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.</span>Minor resistance was seen as anticipated below $1,265. The high trade for the week came in at $1,262. Minor support levels exist at $1,200 and $1,180.<img class="wp-image-1617 alignright" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Image-2-300x225.png" alt="Gold vs CRB Commodity Index" width="475" height="356" /></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The near-term technical situation remains largely unchanged from our most recent update, and is focused upon the resolution of the pennant formation (red highlight) visible on the chart above. </span>
<p style="text-align: left;">As this pattern is drawing closer to a resolution, we will begin to regularly track the precise figures which would constitute a breakout in either direction. Those levels are:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Upper boundary breakout -- $1,290 and falling.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Lower boundary breakout -- $1,155 and rising.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whichever of these boundaries breaks first, the resolution of this pattern will set the stage for the direction of the entire precious metals market for the subsequent 12-18 months. It will be an exciting remainder to 2017 to say the least!</p>

		<title>Daily Market Review - April, 4</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,252.30 (+0.11%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.42 (+0.27%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $965.70 (+0.17%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $811.00 (+0.55%), Dow Jones index 20,638.91 (0.05% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
Gold started a  new trading month, jumping $4 by settlement yesterday. The metal is now back over $1,260. Silver’s also trading pretty confident on Tuesday. Meanwhile, U.S. Dollar opened lower against the majority of currency.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold is looking fantastically more attractive as the market keeps pulling back from its record highs, with the Dow Jones falling for the eighth straight session this week in its longest losing streak since 2011.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of investors consider the timing couldn’t be better for gold. The dollar is plummeting, the stock market has lost over 80 percent of the gains it made, and gold is once again everyone’s favorite safe haven asset.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of investors Gold’s not just a simple safe haven investment. There is a new research that proves gold has the potential to do much more than just protect wealth. In fact, it could be the “magic bullet” your portfolio needs right now.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market opened lower on Tuesday: S&amp;P 500 2,355.78 (-0.13%) and NASDAQ Index 5,894.71 (-0.17 %), Dow Jones Industrial Average  20,637.50 (-0.06%).</span>

The investors exercised caution ahead of an important meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Xi and Trump will meet Thursday and Friday at Mar-a-Lago. Last week, Trump said via Twitter the meeting would not be easy.
The presidents of the U.S. and China are expected to discuss North Korea, trade, security, U.S. jobs, and currencies. Trump's past comments have raised concern over the potential for conflict, though some analysts said they see room for compromise.
The economic calendar in the U.S. on Tuesday includes the U.S. Trade Balance for February at 8:30 a.m. EDT. The U.S. trade deficit in January rose 9.6% to $48.5 billion, the highest level in nearly five years. Economists expect the trade deficit to come in $46 billion. Also on the Tuesday calendar are Factory Orders for February, scheduled at 10 a.m.
Markets are once again facing negative real interest rates and rising asset prices. That can clearly be seen in price-to-earnings multiples for equities which have consistently been on the rise.]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - April, 5</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,245.50 (-0.95%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.25 (-0.70%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $964.70 (-0.04%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $814.35 (+0.93%), Dow Jones index 20,835.82 (0.71% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
The U.S. dollar index fell 0.8 percent against a basket of six major currencies on Wednesday.

The majority of investors do not see the US Dollar breaking below key technical levels over coming months and therefore the under-performance seen thus far in 2017 is likely to fade.

Gold lost almost have been crawling higher 9% while silver lost 14%.

This week the precious metals appear to be building a base, still, waiting for news that will make it move.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market opened higher on Wednesday: S&amp;P 500 2,372.03 (+0.50%) and NASDAQ Index 5920.05 (+0.36%), Dow Jones Industrial Average  20,835.20 (+0.71%).</span>

The higher open of US market can be easily explained by the rise in oil prices and with ADP National Employment Report released earlier Wednesday exceeding expectations.Trading on Wednesday was higher, however, traders are still waiting for Federal Reserve meeting minutes and President Donald Trump’s meeting with his Chinese counterpart this week.

The Dow added 83 points to begin the day at 20,835 and the S&amp;P 500 rose seven points to 2,367 points. The American private sector added 263,000 jobs in March, according to the ADP National Employment Report released earlier Wednesday, a significant rise compared to the market expectation, which forecast 185,000 job additions.
Traders also look forward to the global oil market will focus on weekly changes in crude oil and gasoline inventories in the U.S., which will be announced later Wednesday by the U.S.' Energy Information Administration.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,253.20 (+0.19%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.27 (+0.32%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $957.40 (-1.04%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $803.20 (-1.13%), Dow Jones index 20,623.12 (0.12% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar rose slightly against a basket of currencies. Gold price holds high on Thursday, but generally, in trading, the precious metals come show the relative laggards. Platinum and palladium start the day lower, silver gained a few points.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong ADP jobs report yesterday pushed gold and silver prices a bit lower and precious metals keep feeling pressure thanks to a USD Index that continues to recover slowly. Normally, the ADP report doesn’t get a lot of attention from investors, but because investors are still in an anxious and indecisive mood, with stock markets showing no clear trend in either direction, this report was overvalued. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The traders look forward to China’s President Xi Jinping and President Trump </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">meeting today, worry about a rift between the world’s top two economies. Signs that the two leaders could find common ground may downgrade fears and remove a perceived barrier to continued Fed rate hikes, sending the US Dollar upward. The dollar's loss in value recently time means that imports from places other than China or Japan will cost more and more for US market. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The news of missile firing by North Korea into the sea on Wednesday, a day before US President Donald Trump’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping took the US Dollar Index back low in value.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market opened higher on Thursday: S&amp;P 500 2,357.28 (+0.17%) and NASDAQ Index 5,874.35 (+0.17 %), Dow Jones Industrial Average  20, 623.12 (+0.12%).</span>

Wall Street ended lower on Wednesday after a late-afternoon reversal following signals from the Federal Reserve that it could change its bond investment policy this year, quenching a rally sparked by a strong private-sector jobs report. Also pressuring the market late Wednesday were comments from House Speaker Paul Ryan in which he indicated that tax reform is still ways off.

A key issue today: the meeting of China’s President Xi Jinping and President Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. Traders and investors consider this is the most important meeting of the year for US economy.  Between trade disputes and the threat of North Korea, the two leaders have plenty to discuss. Investors expect North Korea to be the main geopolitical issue at this meeting.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This meeting attracts a large amount of publicity, and investors will be watching the headlines, scanning for clues as to how President Donald Trump will proceed with China after repeatedly attacking it during his campaign. </span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,267.70 (+1.13%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.45 (+0.54%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $969.00 (+0.70%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $806.85 (+0.09%), Dow Jones index 20,620.42 (0.21% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold price rose more than 1 percent on Friday to a 5-month high as investors sought safe-haven assets after the United States launched cruise missiles on a Syrian air base, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">potentially escalating tensions with Syrian allies Russia and Iran. Gold looks set to complete a run of four consecutive weekly gains this week.  Silver starts trading today with a little change from the previous close. Platinum price also climbed around 1 per cent to 969.00 per ounce. Palladium price changed slightly. Generally, palladium has a completely different dynamic to other precious metals. It is far more related to economic data releases, the expectations for the economy. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. dollar rose 0.25 percent against a basket of currencies after Thursday meeting of President Trump and Xi Jinping, and late-Thursday airstrike against Syria. The dollar index took the recovering course form being slightly lower earlier and is now up slightly in the session. Investors suggest that US Dollar Index is getting better but it's not getting better quickly. It appears that for now, gold is the preferred safe haven instrument being bought up by investors.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened slightly lower : S&amp;P 500 2,351.72 (-0.24%) and NASDAQ Index 5,859.16 (-0.33 %), Dow Jones Industrial Average  20,620.42 (-0.21%).</span>

The U.S. missile strike on a Syrian air base overnight caused a knee-jerk shift into U.S. stocks, although the impact was moderate as it is being interpreted as a one-off proportionate response.The main reaction was initially seen in the price of oil, which jumped to a one-month high in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, climbing by just over $1 a barrel to $56.08. Although Syria isn’t a major producer, the country is close to pipelines and routes that transport oil and fear of supply disruptions tend to push oil prices higher. Investors  will also watch out for March U.S. non-farm payrolls data due later on Friday, which analysts say could be key for the short-term direction of the gold market.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday is the second day of  Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping meeting, investors look forward to more updates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the investors overweight a weaker-than-expected March employment data this week, the Labor Department report showed that the U.S.created just 98,000 new jobs in March, marking the smallest gain in almost a year, as hiring cooled. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The conflict with Syria, a lousy employment data and ongoing uncertainty about the Trump administration could keep U.S. stocks and precious metals under the pressure.</span>

		<title>Silver Reverses Friday – Manipulation?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday saw a dramatic day in the precious metals market. In the aftermath of the US retaliatory strike on Syria, gold and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> both rose sharply higher in the overnight hours early Friday morning, only to reverse lower by the close of trading for the week. </span>

In general, short-term political and/or terrorism-related market reactions tends to be short-lived. Friday proved to be no exception.Let us turn to an examination of the silver market, which saw the most dramatic move on Friday.For the week as a whole, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> underperformed <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, finishing lower by $0.30 cents or 1.7%. The final trade on the New York electronic access market was $17.96.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1646 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Silver-1024x766.png" alt="Silver Breakout" width="646" height="483" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By failing to overcome the $18.50 - $19.00 initial resistance zone (black lines), this resistance level takes on increasing importance going forward. On any further weakness, we expect the $16.75 to $17.25 region to act as support at the low range.</span>

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1647" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Silver-Friday-300x245.png" alt="SLV Silver Trust " width="300" height="245" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The trading on Friday is worthy of further discussion. There has been mention in other areas within the precious metals investment world that the decline on Friday was entirely due to “manipulation.” On the surface, when we examine the intraday price action, it appears clear that this was not a normal trading pattern.</span>
<h3><b>On Manipulation</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are reading this article, you have demonstrated an interest in profiting from these markets, and not simply sitting idly as a passive victim of manipulation. </span><b>We aim to thrive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not to be victims.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If a market is so manipulated that it can never advance in our favor, we should move onto another market. The reason we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> involved in the precious metals is because we know that the sum of the participants are ultimately stronger than any attempts at suppression. Manipulation may exist, but it is not stronger than the market itself.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is no coincidence that the above selling took place just below the $18.50 level. Our charts had previously identified this resistance level. This was an important swing high from February, and sellers are appearing in this region once again.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We now switch over to the trading desk chart to examine the intraday volume on Friday:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1648" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Silver-2.png" alt="Silver chart on Friday" width="687" height="507" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A buying gap did indeed appear in the trading on Friday afternoon. </span>

However, the volume on Friday’s decline was not abnormally high. As can be seen on the chart, volume was higher at times during the consolidation and advance of the preceding two days.

When a drop such as this happens on moderate volume, it indicates sellers were met with relatively few buyers – not that an inordinate amount of sellers appeared. Such a reversal lower on moderate volume indicates that buyers were exhausted from the previous advance… and when buyers become exhausted, by definition it is sellers who remain. Thus, even a moderate volume of selling can cause a significant drop such as on Friday.

This is exactly the type of trading action that constitutes a consolidation. Sellers are making it clear where they desire to sell, and now we take a step back and observe where the next round of buyers show up. At each successive attempt to overcome the $18.50 - $19.00 resistance zone, futures contracts and physical metal are transferred from weak hands to strong – and when enough silver has been transferred in this way – the next advance will see an absence of sellers at the aforementioned resistance zone. The price can then advance to a new relative high.

Consolidations such as this are extremely healthy. Linear advances higher tend to not be sustained, as we saw in 1H 2016. To the contrary, advances followed by consolidations allow a market to move higher over the long run without drawing too much attention and without the extreme swings seen last year.

Longer-term investors should not be fearful to see a well-defined consolidation continuing at this juncture.
<b></b>
<h3><b>What Do the Silver Miners Say?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is sometimes beneficial to monitor the relative trading action in the silver mining sector and compare it to the price of silver bullion itself.</span>

These are two components of the same industry, and we sometimes see divergences which give us hints as to which direction the markets may be moving over the intermediate term.

Focusing for a moment specifically on the silver miners, which tend to exaggerate declines in silver lower if they are expecting sustained weakness, we note that the miners largely brushed off the precipitous drop seen on Friday afternoon in silver bullion.<img class="alignright wp-image-1649" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Silver-3-289x300.png" alt="Silver mid-week range " width="354" height="367" />

At right we show the SIL silver miners fund on top, and the SLV fund on bottom (silver proxy). Note how the miners closed within the mid-range of the week’s trading, whereas silver bullion closed clearly lower than the week’s trading range. This is the type of divergence we should expect if the miners are not anticipating sustained further weakness in silver bullion.

Silver investors can monitor this relationship to gain some insight as to what may be coming for the metal itself. At least over the short run and after <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/03/20/fed-rate-hike-results-in-successful-silver-retest/">successful silver retest</a>, the mining equities appear to not believe silver will be falling much further.

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A return to the prior consolidation zone between initial support ($16.75 - $17.25) and initial resistance ($18.50 - $19.00) would represent healthy basing action from a long-term investment perspective.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The old investment adage goes: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The longer the base, the bigger the move.”</span></i>

		<title>Daily Market Review - April, 10</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,251.70 (-0.32%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.95 (-0.77%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $944.10 (-1.40%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $806.85 (-1.85%), Dow Jones index 20,689.00 (0.16% increase).</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A new Monday morning starts with a fresh look over markets by bringing you everything you need to follow up for making well-thought investment decisions during the next 5 days. </span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar rebounded after losing ground and quite strong again. Gold dropped down on Monday on a stronger dollar, moving away from a 5-month high hit in the previous session, although geopolitical tensions continued to distract safe-haven demand for the precious metal. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver was already trading above its 200-day moving average  last week before it moved higher but it then reversed strongly and even below its 200-day moving average. Last week, Spot gold prices rose by 0.4 percent, to close at $1253.6. The market analytics expected that precious metals would pack to trade positive after the US launches a military attack on Syria building up safe-haven appeal, on Monday all four precious metals prices dropped down. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The probability of further military action against Syria and rising tensions with Russia could potentially keep safe haven assets for precious metals from falling too far. </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher : S&amp;P 500 2,358.72 (+0.10%) and NASDAQ Index 5,882.56 (+0.08 %), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20,689.00 (0.16%).</span>

Oil prices rose more than 1 percent, supported by strong demand, uncertainty over the conflict in Syria and a shutdown at Libya's largest oilfield.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at the Mar-a-Lago in Florida last week, in which the two leaders struck a friendly note. Some market participants looked at the meeting as a potential risk for stocks.</span>

There is no major economic data points set for release on Monday. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen speaks later today at an engagement in Michigan.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week’s economic calendar is light, with key reports reviews not out until Friday, that's why calendar doesn’t come into focus until the end of the week.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A few events this week: the preliminary April consumer sentiment index from the University of Michigan survey is also on tap (Thursday).  Other data during the week includes February JOLTS job openings, along with the NFIB small business survey (Tuesday), trade prices for March, along with the Treasury budget (Wednesday), as well as weekly initial jobless claims and March PPI (Thursday).</span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - April, 11</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,266.10 (+0.75%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.17 (+0.66%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $959.70 (+1.41%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $800.90 (+1.19%), Dow Jones index 20,606.56 (0.25% decrease).</i></b>
<h3>
<b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar is dipping on Tuesday morning. Meanwhile, all four precious metals rose today, especially gold and platinum prices.  Gold price rose above rising geopolitical tensions buoyed, while US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen’s comments on gradual US interest rates rises yesterday had a limited impact. </span>

Gold prices are retreating from highs set in the wake of the surprise US missile strike on Syria last week. The US missile attack on a Syrian airbase prompted concern and an increase in safe-haven demand for precious  metals initially, that initial concern faded quickly. However, investors have plenty of global geopolitical happenings to discuss and consider.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Geopolitics remain another issue: US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attends a meeting with his G7 counterparts. Comments hinting that the US is now prepared to join efforts to remove Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad may boost regional instability concerns, driving both gold and crude oil higher.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened lower : S&amp;P 500 2,346.74 (-0.45%) and NASDAQ Index 5,881.53 (-0.52%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20,606.56 (-0.25%).</span>

After Monday's close, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the Fed was focused on allowing the economy to maintain its gains.Tuesday’s moves come as investors grow anxious about rising tensions in Asia, notably with North Korea, and as concerns grow that a presidential election in France could lead to the destabilization of the European Union, unsettling financial markets.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no major economic data points set for release this week. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least, what investors are most interested in this week is hearing from the bank CEO's who report earnings on Thursday. And with this is a week before the Easter Holiday, the things can come slow down. </span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,275.70 (+0.09%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.41 (+0.27%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $968.20 (-0.40%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $793.50 (-1.68%), Dow Jones index 20,628.75 (0.11% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar Index (DXY) is marginally higher in today’s trading, currently at 100.73, a gain of 0.02% over Tuesday’s close. Palladium and Platinum prices were trading lower on the early morning. Gold prices on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) were trading flat with a small change in early deals on Wednesday. Meanwhile, in general, the price of gold is rising on the back of a weak dollar and is slightly weaker against a stronger euro. Rising global tension around Syria and North Korea have pushed gold prices to their highest level since November as investors shift to safe haven assets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you put that mix together: Syria, Trump, North Korea, it’s a volatile thing, and it’s that uncertainty that investors are concerned about. The upcoming French presidential election is also adding to worries about volatile global politics, according to analysts, adding a risk-off mood may continue to translate into gold gains.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened lower : S&amp;P 500 2,349.76 (-0.17%) and NASDAQ Index 5,862.94 (-0.07%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20,628.75 (-0.11%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices, which hit five-week highs after last week’s U.S.-ordered airstrikes against Syrian infrastructure, followed by production outages from Libya’s largest oilfield, are now at their highest since December, when they got a huge boost from the OPEC historic deal to cut production.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets were watching for developments on the geopolitical front as US secretary of state Rex Tillerson meets with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow today.Tensions between the two military super-powers rose after Donald Trump launched cruise missile strikes on a Syrian airbase last week; a move that appears to have threatened Russia who has a heavy involvement in Syria.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, investors are keeping an eye on developments in the French election and risks surrounding Syria and North Korea, while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prepared for the first rush of corporate earnings on Thursday.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week’s economic calendar is light because of upcoming Easter weekend, that's why calendar doesn’t come into focus until the end of the week.</span>]]></content>

Gold Coin is also favored for its exclusive bullion security enhancements: the micro-engraved leaf privy mark with the last two digits of the mintage year, the radial lines light-diffracting background pattern, and the Bullion DNA anti-counterfeiting technology.

		<title>Daily Market Review - April,13</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,289.00 (+0.17%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.65 (+0.42%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $980.50 (+0.38%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $803.75 (+0.12%), Dow Jones index 20,540.24 (0.25% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar slipped to a five-month low after Donald Trump said in his interview to the Wall Street Journal yesterday that the currency was getting “too strong” and that he would prefer the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates capped. “It’s very, very hard to compete when you have a strong dollar and other countries are devaluing their currency,” said Trump.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Currency investors responded immediately by selling the greenback. President Trump also said the upcoming report by the US Treasury Department wouldn’t label China as a currency manipulator. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After this announcement gold price is trading at the new weekly highs today. Silver price started a new day with a slight change. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of market strategists consider that unexpected geopolitical events like airstrike on Syria last week have a  short-live effect on gold, meanwhile, this US Dollar roller coaster definitely will keep influence gold price in the nearest future.  </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
U.S. stocks on Thursday opened lower: S&amp;P 500 2340.93 (-0.17%) and NASDAQ Index 5829.76 (-0.11%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20,540.24 (-0.25%) after Donald Trump words about U.S. dollar "getting too strong”.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices shed earlier losses and moved slightly higher on Thursday after an energy watchdog said the market is “very close” to a balance after years of oversupply. Oil prices also found support from a weaker dollar.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the light economic data this week, the majority of strategists are concentrated on the global political triggers for the stock market in the upcoming weeks. They expect market volatility to pick up around France's presidential election, the first round of which is April 23. Trump's first military foray into Syria last week was a bit of a surprise to the market, but it has taken it in stride. The bond market, however, could see a flight to safety if the situation escalates or becomes more uncertain. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial markets will be closed in observance of Good Friday, however, a batch of data are slated for the day because it isn't a federal holiday. Data include a reading of retail sales and consumer prices for March.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - April,14</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,289.60 (+0.08%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.63 (+0.26%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $978.30 (+0.02%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $797.20 (-0.06%), Dow Jones index 20,453.25 (0.67% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
Gold and silver prices ended the session higher and scored five-month highs yesterday. The gold market continues to see an updraft from safe-haven demand amid a rise in geopolitical tensions.The key outside markets on Friday with saw the U.S. dollar index trading lower following Trump’s negative remarks on the greenback. All US stocks are closed on Friday.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The three main U.S. indexes ended the week in negative dynamic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: S&amp;P 500 2328.95 (-0.68%) and NASDAQ Index 5805.15 (-0.02%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20,453.25 (-0.67%), and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stock and bond markets are closed on Friday in observation of the Good Friday holiday. Thursday was the final trading day this week and also the unofficial beginning of first quarter earnings season.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The investors have been largely focused on geopolitical headlines and  at the end of the week the tension was even worse after news that the U.S. military dropped its largest non-nuclear bomb on an ISIS tunnel complex in Afghanistan.</span>

Energy stocks led the broad decline, which gathered momentum in the final hour of trading ahead of the long Easter holiday weekend. The slide marked the lowest close for the stock market since Feb. 13 and came on a day when several major banks reported their latest quarterly results, kicking off the company earnings season.]]></content>

		<title>Gold Breakout is Approaching</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold is inching ever closer to a resolution of the primary converging pattern that we have been monitoring for the last six months. The resolution of this pattern is going to define the trajectory for the precious metals market into 2018, so it continues to deserve our foremost attention. We have supporting indicators from other markets, but we should always evaluate gold as a distinct entity. The price action over the last week has been encouraging, although not yet decisive. For the week, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> finished higher by 2.5% or $31, to close at $1,288 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX late Friday afternoon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two significant technical concerns at this juncture. Please reference the updated 18-month gold chart below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1697 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2011-2017-Downtrend-1-1024x767.png" alt="18-month gold chart" width="588" height="441" />
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold is once again immediately challenging the 2011 – 2017 long-term downtrend (magenta color), which has held prices lower throughout the entire multi-year decline. The exact figure we want to see exceeded and held on a weekly close is $1,290 per ounce to confirm this breakout.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The region between $1,310 and $1,337 represents “Trump Reversal Resistance.” This is the price zone that was tested on the evening of Trump’s presidential victory on November 9, before the $65 intraday reversal occurred in the early morning hours. This reversal lower occurred on the <b>highest single daily volume in gold trading history</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as can be seen from the red callout on the volume indicator above.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>High Volume Reversals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">High volume reversals are near-universally never exceeded on the first attempt to overcome them. The reason for this is the sheer number of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold </a>buyers who purchased futures contracts that day and are now underwater, and who then desire to sell at break-even when the price matches their entry level. Again, gold’s November 9 reversal saw the highest ever daily volume in gold trading history, and so barring an outbreak of major international war, </span><b>we place the odds of gold exceeding the $1,310 - $1,337 Trump Reversal Resistance at near-zero on its first attempt.</b>

Yes, international tensions are on the rise, as can be seen over the last two weeks with the United States retaliation against Syria; the US dropping the largest non-nuclear bomb ever detonated against ISIS in Afghanistan; continued saber-rattling between North Korea, China, and the US; and uncertainty regarding Russian support for Syria. Yet unless world superpowers are literally on the edge of World War III – an event we see as a low probability – the two technical resistance levels referenced above are the ones that will exert primary influence on the gold market here and now.
<h3><b>Early Indicator</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week we noticed early warning trend indicators coming from the gold mining complex. Note in the chart below how the senior gold miners index (HUI) has broken out through its similarly-shaped converging pattern (blue lines). At this juncture, it appears that the miners are hinting that strength is to be expected in gold bullion itself.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1698" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Breakhout-1024x766.png" alt="Breakhout in Large-Cap Gold Miners" width="565" height="422" />
<h3><b>Scenarios for Gold – Remainder of 2017</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The pending breakout pattern for gold will be important because the initial  target of the breakout is calculated to be equal to the 2016-2017 consolidation amplitude: roughly $330 ($1,378 - $1,045, rounded down). As gold’s consolidation reaches an apex at $1,205 (see far right, gold chart page 1), </span><b>the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/02/20/gold-targets-1300/">gold target</a> for a breakout is $1,535 within 6-12 months.</b>

The timing for gold’s next advance therefore depends on when it indeed breaks its long-term downtrend. Two scenarios are thus illustrated on the chart (page 1) above, highlighted in green and orange/red.

<b>Scenario A – </b><b>highlighted (page 1) in green:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short covering and/or geopolitical tensions result in a breaking of gold’s long-term downtrend above $1,290 within the next 2-4 weeks.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold’s short-term advance targets $1,320, as short sellers who were trapped between $1,200 and $1,260 cover en masse.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders holding futures contracts since November 9 (Trump’s victory reversal) exit positions between $1,310 - $1,337.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold stalls in the Trump Reversal Resistance zone and retreats to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its broken 2011 – 2017 long-term downtrend during Q2 above $1,260.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A successful retest of the broken trendline leads to the initial impulsive wave of the advance to target $1,535.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">(Readers may find the nature of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>’s retest of its broken second-half 2016 downtrend, discussed in recent articles, to be a helpful analogy for what we could expect for gold’s retest of its long-term downtrend, once broken.)</span>

<b>Scenario B – </b><b>highlighted (page 1) in orange</b><b>/</b><b>red</b><b>:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold fails to exceed its long-term downtrend within the next 2-3 weeks, and thus falls back to within the converging pennant consolidation.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support should be expected to emerge above the $1,180 - $1,200 support zones.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continued consolidative price action defines trading through mid-Q3 2017.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A resolution of the converging pennant must occur by Q3 – Q4 2017.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early technical indicators (HUI senior gold miners, gold/silver ratio) suggest this resolution will be higher. Target would remain $1,535.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;">Although a low probability, we must mention the downside risk. If the convergence resolves lower through a break of the 2015-2016 rising trendline (blue), gold would target $875 per ounce in 2018 ($1,205 convergence - $330 amplitude).</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold Prices</b></h3>
The next 2-3 trading weeks will set the trajectory for the remainder of 2017. A strong advance through the declining long-term downtrend sets the stage for a first challenge of the Trump Reversal Resistance zone, which should be followed by a retest of the broken line. We then expect a strong impulsive advance to target new highs for gold in 2018.

Conversely, a rejection at the long-term downtrend means gold must continue to consolidate within its primary converging pennant for Q2 – Q3. Early indicators suggest the eventual outcome will be higher, although a low-probability resolution to the downside must be monitored until proven otherwise.

		<title>Daily Market Review - April,17</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,289.30 (+0.11%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.60 (+1.08%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $986.40 (+0.80%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $793.90 (-0.55%), Dow Jones index 20,453.25 (0.67% decrease).</i></b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A new Monday morning  after a long Easter weekend and closed market on Friday starts with a fresh look over markets by bringing you everything you need to follow up for making well-thought investment decisions during the next 5 days.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar is lower on Monday, the index is down by 0.4%. However, gold hit a five-month high on Monday as the dollar weakened with investors taking refuge in safe-haven assets in the wake of rising geopolitical tensions over North Korea. The precious metals started week up, the yellow metal has gained 5% over the past four weeks, silver prices started in with a small change in the morning session.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Geopolitics have taken a turn last week, however, as what some consider fresh provocations by North Korea have increased already high tension levels between the U.S. and North Korea. The situation has increased to the degree that Vice-President Mike Pence has been dispatched to the region and there are discussions taking place about a potential U.S. offensive.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold is highly sensitive to the changes in the U.S. geopolitical situation. Investors suggest that gold will likely retain a measure of strength heading into the French elections this week, while ongoing tensions in North Korea should also keep the markets rather nervous.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
U.S. stocks on Monday opened sharply higher S&amp;P 500 2341.77 (+0.55%) and NASDAQ Index 5838.00 (+0.57%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20,575.62 (+0.60%). U.S. stocks rebounded sharply on Monday after a long weekend and as markets corrected higher following last week’s slump. The S&amp;P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.4% a piece.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most significant event is the French Presidential election on Sunday, April 23, and for much of the week, the most recent polls will dictate how the trades.</span>

Investors are concentrated on high-profile earnings reports this week, including Johnson &amp; Johnson and Bank of America Corp. U.S. housing and PMI data will dominate the data-driven headlines this week. Housing is said to ‘lead the economy’ so economists watch it closely – a strong rise or fall will be weathercock for the trajectory of the overall economy.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) will report on existing home sales. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the week ahead will feature a visit to Washington from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as well as data on U.S. housing starts and existing home sales, China's first-quarter growth rate and U.K. retail sales</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Geopolitical issues will remain in investors’ view this week, and could depress sentiment if tensions escalate. Over the weekend, North Korea put on a massive military parade, followed by a failed missile launch. In an unannounced visit to the Korean Peninsula’s demilitarized zone.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - April,18</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,287.30 (0.14%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.46 (-0.54%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $989.10 (-0.68%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $788.70 (-1.26%), Dow Jones index 20,538.14 (0.49% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
The U.S. dollar continued to recover from a five-month low on Tuesday. Comments from U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, stating that a strong dollar is good in the long run, offset previous remarks from President Trump who last week said that the dollar is getting too strong and that it is hard to compete when other countries devalue their currency. Mnuchin also agreed that the dollar’s strength in the short run is hurting exports and the economy; based on such mixed signals, traders are finding it difficult to choose on which side to take a trade.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mnuchin sent another signal on tax reforms on Monday, saying that expecting one before August is highly aggressive and not realistic. Investor and traders are likely to start questioning whether Trump will be able to deliver on tax reform and stimulus but so far most signs are negative, thus another negative factor affecting the USD.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Four precious metals started on Tuesday with having lost in some value. Geopolitical tensions over North Korea pressured the dollar against the majority of a world currency. </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2341.69 (-0.31%) and NASDAQ Index 5842.07 (-0.25%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20,538.14 (-0.49%). </span>

Wall Street opened lower today, as a spate of weak earnings compounded concerns over this weekend’s French election and U.S.-North Korea tensions, helping to keep a lid on stocks.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks rose after three straight sessions of losses as investors shifted their focus to earnings and the greenback steadied after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said dollar strength is good over long periods of time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks gained on Monday with a positive outlook on first-quarter earnings. The Housing Market Index was reported on Monday. The index decreased to 68 from 71 with home builders reporting less confidence in the housing market.</span>

Generally speaking this week got off to a slow start was quieter on Monday as most of the world views as a continuation of the Easter Holiday.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week will also feature a visit to Washington from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as well as  China’s first-quarter growth rate and U.K. retail sales.</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,286.10 (-0.38%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.33 (-0.43%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $982.60 (+0.68%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $777.50 (+0.32%), Dow Jones index 20 486.48 (0.18% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold price slipped on Wednesday as the dollar recovered a bit from a three-week low hit in the previous session, but geopolitical concerns about North Korea and nervousness ahead of the French presidential election lent support to the safe-haven asset. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some chart consolidation and profit-taking from the shorter-term futures traders are also featured in gold and silver markets after both scored five-month highs earlier this week.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, we have seen geopolitics issues come keep tension among precious metals. Though spot values have been on the up and up in last weeks, the sideways to downward action we are seeing this week keeps investors attention.Looking ahead to the rest of the week, we can expect much of the same. Investors focused on geopolitics will remain through the end of the week and this will continue to support metals. </span>
<h3>
<b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened slightly higher S&amp;P 500 2347.46 (+0.22%) and NASDAQ Index 5888.41 (+0.67%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20486.48 (-0.18%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The key outside markets on Wednesday morning see the U.S. Dollar Index firmer on a mild corrective bounce from recent selling pressure. Oil edged higher on Wednesday as OPEC said it was committed to eroding a global surplus of crude, but increasing shale production in the United States and still-high global stocks threatened to pull prices lower.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual spring meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund take place in Washington this week. Companies reporting this week include Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., International Business Machines Corp., Netflix Inc., Heineken NV and Unilever.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Still on the front burner of the world marketplace are geopolitical concerns regarding the U.S. and North Korea stand-off, and U.S.-Russia relations. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, on Wednesday, the British Parliament approved by an overwhelming 522 votes against 13 May’s call for an early election, setting the stage what will define the terms of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union.</span>]]></content>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
The U.S. dollar continued to recover from a five-month low against the majority of currency. After treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speech to the Financial Times that US President Donald Trump is "absolutely not" trying to talk down the strong dollar,investors consider the US Dollar is still unsteady this week, tensions over North Korea and looming French and U.K. elections that hold implications for the European economy have provided haven investor demand for precious metals in recent days.

Gold price is holding up well this morning, with spot prices little changed. Though investors are still very much paying attention to what is happening in Asia, worries surrounding a potential US-North Korean war have diminished significantly.

Geopolitical concerns remained to the forefront after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday that Washington was looking at ways to pressure North Korea over its nuclear program.
<h3>
<b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened slightly higher S&amp;P 500 2343.48 (+0.22%) and NASDAQ Index 5885.89 (+0.39%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20442.90 (+0.19%).</span>

U.S. stocks edged higher on Thursday as investors focused on a deluge of corporate earnings reports and economic data. All the main indexes gained a few points and started day trading higher. Crude oil's solid losses on Wednesday did give equities traders pause, but oil prices have rebounded a bit Thursday morning. U.S. stock indexes are pointed toward higher openings when the New York day session begins.

The world marketplace is still very aware of geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, and the U.S. and Russia. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday afternoon took a very hard line on Iran, too. Tillerson said the days of a passive U.S. stance against regimes like Iran and North Korea are over.

The first round of the French presidential elections will be held this Sunday. The second round will be on May 7. European market watchers are getting more nervous as the French elections approach and polls show tight races. The very existence of the European Union could hinge upon elections in the European Union this year.

Markets on Thursday will be watching a few economic reports, such as initial jobless claims.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,284.00 (+0.07%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.94 (-0.88%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $984.20 (+0.11%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $801.70 (+0.11%), Dow Jones index 20 586.17 (0.17% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
Yesterday saw positive movement in the precious metals thanks in large part to a softer dollar. The USD was slightly weaker, trending under 100.0 on the DXY index. Gold prices end at 1-week low as dollar recovers from 3-week low.

Investors expect gold prices to trade higher today as uncertainty looms ahead of the outcome of the French elections next week.
Gold struggled to hold this week's gains as the dollar strengthened and concerns over global risk eased. However, selling was relatively muted, which suggests a period of consolidation is now upon us.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened little changed S&amp;P 500 2353.33 (-0.11%) and NASDAQ Index 5912.55 (-0.07%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20586.17 (-0.06%).</span>

After a two-week losing streak, major indexes may cling on to their gains this week following Thursday's rally, which was driven partly by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's comments that an overhaul of the tax code would be unveiled very soon. Also corporate earnings and economic reports were positive on Thursday as more companies released quarterly results, and it helped US stocks to gain.

Investors are focused on the outcome of the first round of the French presidential election on Sunday.

Aside from political uncertainty in Europe causing global investors concern, the news that tax reform may be on the table “soon” has also grabbed the attention of the markets.]]></content>

		<title>Gold in Foreign Currencies</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the turbulence in the world political scene surrounding the French election, saber-rattling between the United States and North Korea, and uncertainty regarding Russian support for Syria, let us take the opportunity this week to update our perspective on gold as priced in major world currencies outside the US dollar. If <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/?p=1745&amp;preview=true">gold</a> was found to be violating important support levels across the globe, it would give us reason to question the trajectory for US dollar-priced gold at this juncture. Conversely, if gold as priced in foreign currencies remains strong, it would give us reason to anticipate that US dollar <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold</a> is set advance when we observe a breakout in the consolidation discussed last week.</span>
<h3><b>British Pound to US Dollar (GBP / USD)</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we examine gold as priced in British pound sterling, we should note that just last Monday the pound saw an important breakout versus the US dollar. Below we show the GBP / USD cross pair, from the final drop seen last October in the wake of  the Brexit vote, through present.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1746 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Triagle-Consolidation-breakout.png" alt="Triagle Consolidation breakout" width="527" height="371" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The breakout higher in GBP / USD occurred on Monday as the pound clearly exceeded the triangle consolidation (blue trendlines) above 1.255 which had formed following the terminal stages of the preceding decline.</span>

<b>This breakout signals a reversal higher in British pound sterling in the works.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The initial target for GBP / USD is calculated as 1.318, equal to the amplitude (0.083) of the preceding consolidation added to the apex (off chart, right) of the triangle, at 1.235. It remains to be seen if this reversal develops into a longer-term trend of strength for GBP / USD, but given our suspicion of a multi-year top forming in the US dollar itself, and that GBP represents 11.9% of the dollar index, this breakout should give an initial signal that dollar weakness is likely approaching.</span>

As the strongest periods for precious metals prices tend to correspond with the weakest periods in the US dollar, this breakout in GBP / USD bears monitoring.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[We note here that a reversal higher in GBP is occurring just at the depths of negative sentiment regarding the British pound. Most mainstream media outlets and investment channels have been expecting continued weakness in GBP. As markets so often do, the negative sentiment has already been priced into the current level, and the market has now reversed higher in the opposite direction as prevailing sentiment would seem to dictate.]</span>
<h3><b>Gold in GBP</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning to gold as priced in GBP, we see that the market still remains defined by the long-term rising linear trendline (magenta), which began in 2005. After breaking the 2011 – 2015 downtrend in a surge to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">£900 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in early 2016, gold then saw a follow-through surge above </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">£900 on the day following the historic Brexit vote.</span>

Note that following the climb to over £,050, gold then fell right back to £900 in December 2016, successfully retesting that breakout point.

Gold closed last week at £1,006.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot make short-term predictions about GBP-priced gold at this juncture, but the major point of this analysis is to determine if there are red flags as per the worldwide gold market that would give us warning signs as to US dollar-priced gold. We see no technical weakness from the long-term perspective in GBP-gold, and indeed this market looks set to re-challenge the £1,200 all-time high (set in 2011) on the next surge, likely within 12-24 months.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1747 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gold-in-British-Pounds-1024x609.png" alt="Gold in British Pounds" width="840" height="500" />
<h3><b>Gold in Euros (EUR)</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold as priced in the European common currency continues to look healthy for the continuation of a worldwide bull market, having closed the week at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">€1,202. We note the continuation of a similar long-term rising trend which began in 2005.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Euro-priced gold broke its 2011 – 2016 downtrend in early 2016, and the advance since then has featured a series of waves, the most recent of which clearly exceeded the prior peak of early 2015 (blue arrows). Lows continue to rise as well, the most recent low coming at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">€1,070 clearly higher than the early 2016 low of €970, itself clearly higher than the prior two lows of 2014 – 2015 (magenta arrows).</span>

We will want to see the rising long-term support line hold on any weakness in EUR-gold, just above €1,050. Based on the current trajectory, we can project that EUR-gold will retest its all-time high near €1,400 within the next 24-36 months, or slightly after GBP-gold.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1748 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gold-in-Euros-1024x609.png" alt="Gold in Euros" width="840" height="500" />
<h3><b>Gold in Australian Dollars (AUD)</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, although gold priced in Australian dollars has remained stronger on a percentage basis than any of the preceding currencies, AUD-gold is the only one to have broken its rising long-term trendline back in 2013. The old investment adage, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The steeper the trend, the less important the break,”</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">comes to mind here, as since that technical break, Australian dollar-priced gold has been the only gold cross pair of major world currencies to retest its all-time high of $1,850, which it did in mid-2016 (red callout arrows).</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1749 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gold-in-Australian-Dollars-1024x608.png" alt="Gold in Australian Dollars" width="840" height="499" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The consolidation taking place since 2011 has taken the distinct shape of a cup formation – and it is likely that the retracement back toward $1,550 in December 2016 represented the “handle” of a cup-and-handle technical formation. For reference, the textbook definition of the pattern is shown below (courtesy Investopedia.com):</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1750 size-medium" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AUD-December-2016-300x266.png" alt="AUD December 2016" width="300" height="266" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon a break of the $1,850 all-time high, the target for AUD-gold is calculated as $2,400, derived from adding the amplitude of the cup consolidation ($550) to the breakout point. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We continue to anticipate that a breakout to new all-time highs in AUD-gold, for those who monitor such signals, will serve as an early-warning to holders of gold in other major currencies that similar breakouts are pending.</span>
<h3><b>Gold in Canadian Dollars (CAD)</b></h3>
Gold as priced in the Canadian “loonie” is one of the most precise technical markets clearly visible on the charts. CAD-gold closed at $1,740 last week, a mere 8% below the all-time high of $1,900 set in 2011.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we show CAD-gold since 2002:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1751 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gold-in-Canadian-Dollars-1024x608.png" alt="Gold in Canadian Dollars" width="840" height="499" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distinctness of the rising long-term (magenta) trendline should leave no doubts as to its importance.</span>

The low for CAD-gold was in 2013, at $1,250 per ounce. This major low was confirmed by the breakout in late-2014 of the declining trendline since the 2011 all-time high (red callout).

Note the well-defined structure of the rising trend since the 2013 bottom: a series of distinct higher lows and higher highs. The most recent higher low came in December 2016 at just below $1,500.

Gold in Canadian dollars looks healthy from a long-term perspective, and we anticipate it may be the second major world currency, following Australian dollar-gold, to see a new all-time high above the 2011 mark.
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold in Foreign Currencies</b></h3>
We perform these periodic reviews of gold in foreign currencies to remain cognizant of what is happening across the international investment arena. As a precious metals investor in 2017, you are indeed part of a worldwide movement.

We see no major technical warnings across gold as priced in any of the major western currencies. Initial retests of all-time highs have either already occurred, or they are expected to occur within the next 24 months. Significant advances following lengthy consolidations should be expected upon successful breakouts of these all-time highs.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The strength seen in gold as priced in foreign currencies continues to give us confidence that the worst laggard of the group <strong><i>(</i></strong></span><b>yet the most important for the worldwide recognition of a new bull market) – gold in US dollars)</b> <b>–</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not far behind.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,276.80 (-0.71%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.96 (-0.22%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $964.10 (-1.16%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $799.60 (+0.21%), Dow Jones index 20 758.95 (1.02 % increase).</i></b>

A new Monday morning after a first round of French presidential election starts with a fresh look over stock markets and economic calendar by bringing you everything needed news for making well-thought investment decisions during the next 5 days.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
All the international attention this weekend was addressed to French election. The gold price was weaker in the morning trading session today, after the first round of French presidential election. The result of the first round affected four basic precious metals:  Gold spot prices and silver spot prices are down, platinum spot price  decreased also, while palladium price continues to rise with a small change.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar index was also weaker today against a basket of six major rivals, was last down 0.9 percent at 99.115 today. There are no high-impact reports on the US calendar today, investors will stay focused on the geopolitical events and upcoming economic data this week.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2371.03 (+0.94%) and NASDAQ Index 5975.87 (+1.10%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20578.95 (+1.04%).

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stock markets rose 1% on Monday, with major indexes advancing in a broad rally after a strong showing by centrist Emmanuel Macron in the French presidential election, which averted fears of a eurosceptic-only runoff. Emmanuel Macron's win in the first round of French Presidential election triggered a dramatic response in global financial markets. With the final outcome of the first round increasing the credibility of the polls, the market now seems to have started pricing-in a definite win for the Centrist candidate Macron against his far-right politician Marine Le Pen at the final run-off on May 7. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors were also waiting to hear more about a “massive” U.S. tax package that President Donald Trump said  is coming this week, which could revive the so-called “Trump trade” that started after his election in November, and which came in hopes that policies seen as pro-growth would swiftly pass Congress.Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday that he would announce a big tax-reform package on Wednesday. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday's session launches a massive week of earnings reporting, with nearly 200 S&amp;P 500 companies and more than a third of the Dow industrials due to report.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The economic calendar for this week</strong>: Chicago Fed National Activity, 4-Week Bill Announcement </span><b>(Monday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, New Home Sales, Consumer Confidence </span><b>(Tuesday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  MBA Mortgage Applications, EIA Petroleum Status Report </span><b>(Wednesday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Weekly Bill Settlement, International Trade in Goods, Jobless Claims </span><b>(Thursday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  Employment Cost Index,  Consumer Sentiment, Chicago PMI </span><b>(Friday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>]]></content>

		<title>15 Most Valuable US Coins</title>
		<content><![CDATA[Coins are valued by consumers for various reasons: investment, aesthetic appeal, numismatic value for collectors, and gifting are the top few. The value of a coin is directly related to how much it weighs, its content, purity, age and most importantly, its rarity. It is possible for a rare copper coin minted in the 19th century to be far more valuable than its intrinsic value but, the value of another similar coin would be a lot less if it is old but it is commonly available. A .9999 gold coin minted this year probably has approximately same value as its intrinsic value but it would be a lot more valuable if it is a limited release of a popular coin series, and is expected to be sold out soon.

<strong>Here is list of the 15 most valuable US coins:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li><b>1794 Silver Dollar </b>
Owning this “Flowing Hair Silver Dollar” minted in 1794 would be a dream come true for any serious numismatist. This rare beauty with her flowing hair has fascinated the numismatic world to such an extent that the coin was sold at an auction conducted by Stack’s Bowers Galleries for an astounding $10 million in 2013. That was a new world record price for any coin. The coin’s mintage was minuscule but was used heavily in circulation and served as a face of the young United States to the world outside. This is a popular image of the 18th century America.
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1771" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1794-Silver-Dollar-1.jpg" alt="" width="471" height="263" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li><b>   1804 Ten Dollar Gold Piece </b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In total only ten of these coins were produced, out of which currently only three are known to exist. Similar to the 1804 Silver Dollar, these coins were also minted in 1834, but dated as 1804. The only auctioned coin was from the King of Siam set and was sold for $8.5 million in 2005.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1772" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1804-Ten-Dollars-300x168.jpg" alt="1804 Ten Dollars" width="443" height="248" />
<ol start="3">
 	<li><b> 1933 Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle </b></li>
</ol>
Although 445,500 Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle coins were minted in 1933, today only a handful of coins are available making this collection highly  rare and valuable. These coins were never released for circulation due to Frank Roosevelt’s executive order suspending gold coinage and confiscating all gold coins in circulation for melting. Only 20 coins were saved from melting process as they were stolen and sold to the collectors. The secret services could recover 19 of them out of which 9 were melted. Nowdays, only a handful  coins remain and they are highly valuable today. One coin was bought by a private owner for a colossal sum of US$7.59 million in 2002.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1773" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1933-Saint-Gaudnes-300x168.jpg" alt="1933 Saint Gaudnes" width="432" height="243" />
<ol start="4">
 	<li><b>  1804 Silver Dollar </b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This coin has the limelight for its rarity and for the well-known fact,that it was sold for a whopping $4.14 million at an auction. There are only 15  coins available in the entire world and the interesting part is none of these coins were actually minted in 1804. All the coins were either minted in 1830 or later. The elegantly draped bust and bowed head Liberty is a design that all numismatists will want to own. The coin's rarity, beauty, and design is extremely popular in the numismatic world. </span>

<ol start="5">
 	<li><b>1870-S Three Dollar Gold Piece  </b>
This coin was produced from 1854-1889 and designed by James B. Longacre. The 1870’s coins are considered to be one of the rarest on the marketplace as only two of these 1870-S Three Dollar Gold Piece were known to be struck and only one is known saved now. Its believed that only one such coin existed and that it was struck to be placed in the cornerstone of the U.S. Mint building in San Francisco. The coin was minted using a special cast and has unique hand carved “S” mark. The coin is hold in the American Numismatic Association Museum in Colorado Springs  and its value is $4 million.
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1808" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1870-s-3-Dollars-300x149.jpg" alt="1870-s 3 Dollars" width="422" height="210" /></li>
 	<li><b>1849 Coronet Double Eagle </b></li>
</ol>
The Double Eagle is a one-of-the-kind coin, which mintage was inspired by the 1848 California Gold Rush, and changed the history of American Coinage forever. Till 1849 the highest coin denomination was $10, but the Gold Rush led to an abundant influx of gold into the US Mint, and hence an idea to produce a higher coin denomination. In 1849 only two pieces of Double Eagle coins were produced in proof condition, one of them is stored at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. and the whereabouts of the other coin is unknown. Many numismatics believe that if the coin was available its value would be $4 million. The coin was designed by James B. Longacre and features a profile portrait of Liberty wearing a small coronet.

7. <b>1907 Ultra-High-Relief Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle </b>If this coin were not minted at the order of President Theodore Roosevelt, we would never witness this beautiful coin, designed by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. The goodwill to introduce American coinage to the world and Roosevelt's affection for Greek and Roman high relief coins motivated Saint-Gaudens to create this masterpiece. Although the coin was not accepted initially for its impractical design, because the high relief made stacking coins difficult, these coins are considered to be one of the most beautiful and valuable coins in the American history. They say that around ten of these coins is preserved in Fort Knox. Only two coins are out in the world, one is stored at Smithsonian Institute and the other one was owned by Egypt’s King Farouk.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1815" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1907-Ultra-High-Relief-Saint-Gaudens-2-300x168.jpg" alt="1907 Ultra High Relief Saint-Gaudens" width="423" height="237" />

8. <b>1943 Bronze Lincoln Cent </b>

In 1943 the Government of USA tried to conserve copper which was necessary for ammunition in World War II. The U.S. Mint began using steel blanks for the Cents in an effort to conserve copper. Over a billion "Steelies" (as they are known popularly) were struck by the three Mints combined in 1943; Philadelphia alone produced over 684,000,000 examples.  However, a handful of rare 1943 Cents has been discovered struck in error on old-style, bronze blanks. These bronze cents became one of the rarest coins in American coinage, highly sought after by passionate collectors.

<b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is another rare coin in the American coinage history. This Liberty Head Nickel was produced in an extremely limited quantity and unauthorized by the US Mint, making it one of the best-known rarities among collectors. Only five of these coins are known to exist, and there is not a lot of information about their minting process. However, that was the first coin to break the million dollar barrier when at an auction.It was sold to Jay Parrino for $1,485,000 in 1996. </span>

10. <b></b><b>1793 Chain Cent </b>

<b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the first  regular issued coin produced by the US Mint and also the first large cent in America. This coin was only struck  in 1793. Although, this cent did not pick up much commerce wise, this coin is highly regarded by collectors as a valuable coin.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1799" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1793-Liberty-1-300x168.jpg" alt="1793 Chain Cent" width="418" height="234" />11. <b>1885 Trade Dollar </b>

<b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This coin was designed by William Barber and only five proof coins were struck in 1885. This fact made this 1885 Trade Dollar extremely rare and valuable US coin. In January 2006 an authentic Dollar which was previously owned by  the legendary "King of Coins" banker, Louis E. Eliasberg Sr. was sold for $1.3 Million at an auction in Dallas, Texas, USA.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1800" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1885-Trade-Dollar-1-300x168.jpg" alt="1885 Trade Dollar" width="468" height="262" />12. <b></b><b>1873-CC no-arrows Liberty Seated Dime</b>

These Liberty Seated Dimes were minted at the Carson City mints and considered rare coins , because the mint functioned for only a certain amount of time. The Carson City mint also provided more limited series than other US Mint branches. The 1873 Liberty Seated Dime is considered to be one of the rarest coins in the American history. Due to the CC Mint record, 12,400 of these coins were struck when the standard for coin weights were changed. These coins were presumed to be melted and re-coined with the standardized weight and the addition of arrows on either side of the date. However, few of these coins escaped melting for assay purpose and a some pieces were saved for the mint storage. The last time this coin was auctioned in 2004 it was sold for $891,250.

<b></b><b></b>This privately minted coin was produced by the popular gold and silversmith Ephraim Brasher in 1787. Although this coin is not technically part of the US coinage, it is still one of the rare coins produced in the USA. In 1979, a Brasher Doubloon  was sold at an auction for $725,000, which was a record lasted for almost a decade.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1802" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Brasher-Doubloon-1-300x168.jpg" alt="Brasher Doubloon" width="447" height="251" />14. <b>1893-S Morgan Silver Dollar </b>

<b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1893 Morgan Silver Dollars are the rarest coins among all Morgan Silver Dollars. The year 1893 brought several events that ultimately influenced the rarity of this coin. The silver purchase clause of the Act of July 14, 1890, was repealed on November 1, 1893, resulting in a drastically reduced need for silver to be converted into coinage. One of these coins was sold for $414 thousand dollars back in late 2001 at Stacks Auction.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1803" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1893-Morgan-Silver-Dollar-2-300x168.jpg" alt="1893 S-Morgan Silver Dollar" width="463" height="259" />
15. <b>1909-S VDB Lincoln Cent </b>

<b></b>When Victor David Brenner designed this popular coin and placed his initials on the reverse, he didn't think that one day these coins will go down in history. When the coins were released,  the public appreciated the coin's design but was not pleased with the prominent initials VDB on the reverse. The mint had no other option but to respond to the public by removing the initials in its next coin release. However,484,000 of these coins were minted at the San Francisco facility while the next releases were minted at Philadelphia facility. The SF mintage was considered to be limited comparing to Philadelphia and  made S Lincoln Cent extremely popular among collectors. Even some coins are in a bad condition, they still sold for a few hundred dollars at Auctions.

		<title>Daily Market Review - April, 25</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,268.80 (-0.69%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.76 (-1.34%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $958.00 (-1.00%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $801.80 (+0.36%), Dow Jones index 20 966.56 (0.98 % increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
After falling to the lowest levels since November on Monday, the US dollar is slightly weaker on April 25. The sharp rise in the euro yesterday after amid Macron’s lead in first round of France’s presidential election weighed on the US Dollar Index. The main factor which keeping the dollar’s losses is the expectation of a corporate tax reform plan by President Trump, that he announced last week. Corporate income tax is expected to be cut from 35% to 15%. The market is also looking forward to US economic releases scheduled for this week.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors expect gold prices to trade sideways today as uncertainty looms with regards to the two favorable candidates in the French election the second round result. Gold price and silver price are dropping for a second day on morning trading, the platinum price goes with a small change, meanwhile, palladium price slightly increased. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from the lack of big economic data or policy announcements today, the gold market also has run out of steam for the time being due to renewed investor optimism and risk appetite.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2388.07 (+0.59%) and NASDAQ Index 6019.43 (+0.60%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20966.56 (+0.98%).

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The market sentiment improved due to decreased geopolitical tensions amid France’s presidential election. The market is waiting for US CB Consumer Confidence data. The data is scheduled to be released at 10:00 AM EST today. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress returns from a two-week break this week facing a deadline to keep the government operating while President Donald Trump presses harder for some legislative accomplishments as his first 100 days in office wind to a close.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The research team at Danske Bank points out that in the US, Conference Board’s consumer confidence data for April is due and will be the key economic release for today’s US session after the sentiment tide turned sharply positive on Monday after the outcome of the weekend’s French election, Wall Street continued to keep a close eye on the political news. Investors await delivery on a pledge last week from President Donald Trump, who said he planned to release “a big tax reform and tax reduction” plan on Wednesday. The broad rally in U.S. stocks has been predicated on the follow-through of Trump’s campaign promises of lower taxes, less regulation, and more fiscal spending.</span>]]></content>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar edged up in trading on Friday but investors continue to monitor tension after a losing track for greenback against a basket of currencies was too long. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">General view that the US Dollar continues to struggle as US economic data surprises have turned lower, expectations of large tax reforms have been pushed back by Congress, and President Trump indicated lately that he would prefer a weaker Dollar.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Market analysts noted the main problem for US Dollar Index these last months that the US administration has failed to provide significant clarity and guidance on its proposals and, importantly, their implementation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices was a little changed on Friday, silver price and platinum price went down, meanwhile, palladium closes the week with a high increase. </span>

		<title>Gold to Silver Ratio</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The gold to silver ratio (GSR), or the number of ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold, has not followed the timeline of the more aggressive move lower we were anticipating over the last several months. Instead, the ongoing consolidation between 65 – 74 on the ratio has moved toward the upper end of the range over the last few weeks, as <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> has remained steady above $1,260 yet <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver price</a> has fallen to the low $17 range again. </span>

Recall that a rising GSR tends to correspond with falling gold and silver prices, as was seen from 2011 to late 2015.

The final close on the GSR was 73.4 as of Friday afternoon.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1831 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Gold-to-Silver-Ratio-1024x609.png" alt="Gold to Silver Ratio" width="585" height="348" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the most important facet of the above chart is to note that the ratio remains healthfully below the 2011 – 2016 broken rising trend channel (turquoise lines). This breakdown has held for over a year. It would be rare for such a breakdown to reverse and make new highs during the current cycle.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the breaking of this clearly-defined trend channel which alerted us to the changing nature of the precious metals market in early 2016. Although the ratio has not moved lower in favor of silver for the last few months, it remains within the confines of an initial consolidation after the multi-year breakdown. Currently the ratio is facing significant resistance at the 74 level.</span>
<h3><b>Silver to Catch Up</b></h3>
Confirming evidence for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> to play catch up can be seen from a study of the momentum of the ratio’s recent advance, which has reached the highest reading since late February, 2016. The following chart contains the last two years of the GSR, with the momentum indicator (RSI) on top, the GSR immediately below, followed by the price of gold, and then the price of silver, all plotted along the same timescale. Let us examine it closely:
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time the RSI momentum indicator reached above 70 was in February 2016, when <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> had advanced to nearly $1,260, clearly exceeding the previous peak from 2015 at $1,190.  Even so, at that moment silver was “stuck” at $14.75, failing to eclipse its relative 2015 peak of $16.25.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We should recall this early-2016 episode carefully. </span><b>Many analysts at the time asserted that the move in gold was suspect, because silver was not “confirming” gold’s advance each day.</b>

We strongly disagreed at the time, and felt that other technical indicators were confirming a more significant advance to come in both metals. The lag in the move higher for silver was typical of an early-cycle advance in the sector.

<strong>What we can see at right is:</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time the GSR momentum RSI (top of chart) reached 70 this marked the absolute high in the ratio, February 2016.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright wp-image-1832 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Broken-2011-2015-Gold-SIlver-Ratio-Uptrend-203x300.png" alt="Broken 2011-2015 Gold SIlver Ratio Uptrend" width="276" height="408" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">February 2016 also marked a mid-point consolidation in gold after a strong advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver lagged gold’s advance, only to play catch-up over the next four months.</span>

The takeaway is that silver does not need to confirm gold’s move across every timeframe. Silver can lag for weeks, months, or even years in certain instances, and this does not negate the validity of gold, nor the eventual catch-up effect that is to be witnessed in silver itself.
<h3><b>2008 – 2011 Example</b></h3>
Consider an example from the last precious metals advancing cycle. Gold had peaked in March 2008 at $1,033 per ounce, while silver peaked at the same time at $21.50. After the crash of 2008-2009, gold regained its losses and went on to advance to several new all-time highs into 2010, first above $1,033, then above $1,100, and finally above $1,250.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All the while, silver remained below its 2008 peak of $21.50.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was certainly frustrating for silver investors over at least a 12-month period.</span>

<b>GSR with prices of gold &amp; silver: 2008 - 2010</b>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1833 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2008-Gold-to-Silver-Ratio-update.png" alt="2008 Gold to Silver Ratio update" width="435" height="642" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, was gold’s advance suspect because silver was not confirming it? </span>Or, was this an opportunity to accumulate silver, before the period of catch-up? The following extended version of the above chart will tell:

<b>GSR with prices of gold &amp; silver: 2008 - 2011</b>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1834 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Gold-to-Silver-Ratio-4.png" alt="Gold to Silver Ratio " width="419" height="618" />

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that the black vertical line shows the ending of the preceding chart. From that point in mid-2010, silver then advanced 180% toward its 2011 peak while gold advanced 25% over the same timeframe.</span>

The major point of this analysis is to be wary of analysts who claim that silver must confirm gold’s moves across every time period. As silver investors, we must be prepared to watch gold lead sometimes for weeks, months, or years. Other technical indicators must be used to determine whether or not we are in a primary advancing cycle in the precious metals. It is not sufficient to simply watch silver lag and label the move suspect.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The present opportunity looks ripe for silver to begin playing catch up over the near-term, even if there are further periods of lag to come as the metals advance through 2018. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our long-term target is for silver to reach at least 17-1 on the GSR, the level last seen at the 1980 precious metals peak of $850 gold and $50 silver.</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - May, 1</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,264.40 (-0.43%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.11 (-0.93%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $943.60 (-0.66%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $822.10 (-0.84%), Dow Jones index 20950.06 (0.05% increase).</i></b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A new Monday morning after President Trump finished commemorating his first 100-days in office over the weekend starts with a fresh look over stock markets and Economic calendar.  Our daily market review will bring you all needed news for making well-thought investment decisions during the next 5 days.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar got an early-week lift as Congressional negotiators reached a budget deal to avoid government shutdown and introduce a $1 trillion spending package. Gold prices were fairly lower when markets opened on Monday, the first trading day of May. Gold was  pressured by a sharp rise in U.S. equity markets, which rose as corporate earnings showed sustained improvement. Silver price went down,  platinum price and palladium price also decreased at the beginning of the week. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump increased diplomatic contacts with allies in Asia to secure their cooperation to pressure North Korea over its nuclear bomb and missile programs. Meanwhile, based on the late geopolitical events regarding North Korea, investors consider gold prices could continue to decrease throughout the week if there is a lingering threat of a military intervention.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2389.97 (+0.24%) and NASDAQ Index 6078.37 (+0.51%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20950.06 (+0.05%)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the International May Day, many markets across the world are shut for holidays on Monday. US Stock started trading slightly higher while the dollar weakened. Last week focus will be returning to eurozone politics with the second round of presidential elections in France at the end of the week. This week seems busy for macro news and boils down to investors reaction to the Fed and economic data.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The economic calendar for this week: March personal income (Monday), April vehicle sales are projected to rebound (Tuesday), MBA mortgage market indices are due (Wednesday), Initial jobless claims (Thursday). As you can see several key economic data will be released this week as monthly U.S. jobs report. The Federal Reserve's policymaking committee is also slated to meet this week, but they are largely expected to hold rates steady. </span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,253.90 (-0.28%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.92 (+0.23%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $930.20 (-0.72%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $819.00 (+0.17%), Dow Jones index 20950.70 (0.18% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar hit a one-month high on Tuesday because many European countries were on May Day public holiday yesterday and the US dollar bulls have used the opportunity of thin markets to break through some key levels. Gold prices dropped near the three-week lows again today due to the fears and risks globally in general. Silver price slightly increased, platinum price dropped in morning trading, palladium price also increased today. Investors will be looking at the important labor-market report, with April jobs this week. Meanwhile, in the current global economic uncertain environment, precious metals forecast looks highly unsteady.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2391.52 (+0.13%) and NASDAQ Index 6099.67 (+0.11%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20950.70 (+0.18%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stock futures were pointing to a mixed start for Wall Street on Tuesday ahead of a meeting of the Federal Reserve and earnings from tech giant Apple. President Donald Trump turned his attention to breaking up Wall Street banks yesterday, a campaign promise that has yet to materialize despite frequent chatter on the subject. Apple announces its earnings results on Tuesday afternoon, and given that the company generates a significant portion of U.S. corporate earnings, the announcement could move the broader market. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic calendar for today: Data on motor vehicle sales April will be released today. The Federal Open Market Committee will begin two-day policy meeting today.</span>]]></content>

<h2><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metal</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar was fairly stable at the beginning of the week but US interest rates fell amid lower oil prices and US budget wrangling. US dollar is now in suspense ahead of the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision today The Fed will be out with its latest decision at 2 p.m. ET. Market analytics don’t expect the Fed to raise rates at the meeting. However, what they will be looking for is how the Fed appraises recent economic data, and the majority of analytics pretty confident that the Dollar will probably be put in some movement after this meeting. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Base metals prices are down an average, as investors sought higher returns from riskier assets and the dollar firmed as markets waited for cues that the United States may raise interest rates. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold price dropped today, silver price trades as three-month low,  platinum hits a four-month low, palladium prices also fell on Wednesday. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The focus for base precious metals today is definitely in the U.S. interest rate, markets are now speculating that next hike will take place at the June FOMC meeting.The U.S. dollar and political uncertainty in Europe also weights on the gold price.</span>
<h2><b>Stock Market Today</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2385.32 (-0.24%) and NASDAQ Index 6069.69 (-0.42%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20913.42 (-0.17%).</span>

U.S. stock indexes are opening lower, as gains in shares of industrial companies offset losses in the energy sector. Energy companies fell after oil fell to its lowest price in almost six months.
U.S markets are also weighed by an earnings-driven drop of Apple Inc. Apple late Tuesday reported earnings that beat expectations and raised its dividend, but “traders appear to be focusing more on sales results and sales guidance that fell short of expectations.

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,228.70 (-0.87%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.44 (-0.72%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $900.50 (-0.18%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $795.00 (-0.68%), Dow Jones index 20957.90 (0.11% increase).</i></b>
<h2><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metal</b></h2>
The U.S. Dollar Index increased on Thursday and hit more than six-week highs after the Federal Reserve announced it was still on track for two more interest rate hikes this year. The Fed announced that they will keep interest rates unchanged, downplayed weak first-quarter economic growth and emphasized the strength of the labor market in its statement following the end of a two-day policy meeting. However, there is still uncertainty as the economy is really on track for the Fed to raise interest rates twice more this year and to begin reducing its balance sheet.Gold price dropped significantly today, silver, platinum, and palladium also joined gold’s steep decline, dropping about 1%.

There are a number of economic, political and military events that trigger current gold price.
<h2><b>Stock Market Today</b></h2>
U.S. stocks on Thursday opened slightly higher S&amp;P 500 2389.90 (+0.08%) and NASDAQ Index 6075.92 (+0.05%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20957.90 (+0.11%).

<span style="font-weight: 400;">US stock market reacted positively to the FOMC statement, expressing confidence in the U.S. economy, and giving hope that it would raise interest rates again soon. Oil prices have dipped below $50 per barrel in recent days as optimism over a production cut strategy agreed between major producers has faded. American producers, however, have increased their activity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest French election news and last night’s final TV debate with centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron and far-right Marine Le Pen, indicated that Macron is still a favorite to win the second round of the elections this Sunday. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic data for today: Initial jobless claims, Consumer Credit.   </span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,230.80 (+0.04%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.36 (-0.48%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $913.10 (+0.80%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $816.80 (+1.26%), Dow Jones index 20936.17 (0.07% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metal</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Dollar Index futures are trading slightly higher today. Analytics suggest the direction of the index next week is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the French election second round on Sunday. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A rising U.S. currency makes dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies, potentially subduing demand for gold. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold price was a bit higher in the morning trading  still weighed down by a stronger dollar,  U.S. interest rate rises this year and  political uncertainty in Europe. Since the first round (April 23) of the French election, we have seen gold comes under geopolitical uncertainty pressure. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver price slightly dropped, platinum is up after the metal fell to its lowest since December yesterday, palladium price rose today over 1%.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened slightly higher S&amp;P 500 2394.13 (+0.19%) and NASDAQ Index 6087.92 (+0.25%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20936.17 (-0.07%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">French election has been one of the biggest concern for investors recently. Months of fierce campaigning is coming to an end in France on Sunday when Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen battle it out in the second and final round of the country’s presidential election. The U.S. stock market has proved recently to be quite pressured by multiple geopolitical threats and France’s presidential election also has a huge impact on base stock indexes.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to political analytics and the first election round, Emmanuel Macron’s seem winning the presidential runoff, but Marine Le Pen is entirely possible to win due to a phenomenon is known as a differentiated abstention. Her victory is likely to trigger a global equity selloff but the U.S. stock market will be the first to recover in this case.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Emmanuel </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macron’s victory is more "market-friendly" scenario. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional news: The government reported a strong gain in jobs for April on Friday morning, and the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since May 2007.</span>

<b>Economic data for today</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Unemployment rate, Nonfarm payrolls, Average hourly earnings.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Gold and the Fed Meeting</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold price</a> fell $41 from a week prior to close at $1,227 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon. This represents a 3.3% drop from the close a week prior.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A bounce is due, but we clearly see that the gold market wishes to consolidate further over the short-run. </span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1867 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2011-2017-Downtrend-1024x766.png" alt="2011-2017 Downtrend" width="549" height="411" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of the pennant consolidation breakout that must necessarily occur by Q3 – Q4 is not lessened by the consolidation that is underway – in fact, it is only strengthened in its eventual resolution. The more time that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> remains within the context of the consolidation defined by the falling long-term downtrend (magenta color) and the rising blue support, the stronger the breakout that will happen when this pattern is resolved. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Short-term traders are cautioned that volatility and thus opportunity for profit should subside as the consolidation progresses this summer and into Q3. The definition of a converging pennant consolidation is volatility that lessens as buyers and sellers each exhaust one another. The pending new market trend occurs because the next influx of large buyers or sellers is met by exhausted existing participants.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The boundaries of gold’s consolidation now come in at:</span>

<b>Upper boundary: $1,290 and falling.</b>

<b>Lower boundary: $1,155 and rising.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, over the short-run, we anticipate gold is due for a bounce, likely back to the $1,240 - $1,260 region, before consolidation continues through this summer, the technical action for which will be less meaningful within the above ranges until Q3. </span>Our 12-month target upon a breakout remains significantly above or below the $1,205 apex of the consolidation – $1,535 or $875 –  dependent on the direction of the breakout. This target is derived from taking widest amplitude ($330) of the converging consolidation and adding it to the apex of the pattern.
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fed Meeting</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/05/03/daily-market-review-may-3/">The Federal Reserve meeting</a> last week resulted in no change to the US central bank’s short-term interest rate target. The Fed funds rate remains at generationally-low levels, at a range of 0.75% - 1.00%.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The language accompanying the Fed non-decision is being closely securitized by the market:</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Committee views the slowing in growth during the first quarter as likely to be transitory and continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Translated from Fed-speak, this moderately-positive outlook suggests that the Fed will look to raise interest rates at its next meeting, on June 14.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We remind new readers that – contrary to the faulty-logic repeated in most mainstream media outlets – rising interest rates have most closely corresponded with rising precious metals prices throughout history.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, since the first interest rate hike in almost a decade in December</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img class="alignright wp-image-1868" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/US-3-Month-Treasury-Yields.png" alt="US 3-Month Treasury Yields" width="393" height="407" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">2015, each of the following hikes have been met by higher lows forming in the gold price:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>First Fed rate hike – December 2015</strong> – gold: $1,045.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Second Fed rate hike – December 2016</strong> – gold: $1,122.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Third Fed rate hike – March 2017</strong> – gold: $1,198.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our own proprietary technical model, which relies on 3-month Treasury yields as a leading indicator, indeed suggests that a fourth Fed rate hike is pending. At right we show the 3-month yields on top, with the price of gold immediately below, since 2015. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note how US 3-month yields have spiked several weeks in advance of each of the first three rate hikes. Essentially the Fed is responding in policy to higher yields in the short-term Treasury market.</span>

<b>The important point is that the rate announcements have almost exactly corresponded with major lows in the price of gold.</b>

<b>Gold Traders Have Been Wrong Three Times…</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At some point, we should expect gold futures traders – who have gotten this trade wrong on each of the prior three Fed rate hikes by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">selling in anticipation of the rate increase</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (only to see gold rise strongly against them after the announcement) – will wake up and cease this losing strategy. Thus, likely this year, gold may be expected to form its next intermediate low weeks in advance of the Fed announcement as traders wise up.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The futures market is also pricing in a fourth rate hike, as can be seen below by the 83.1% odds that traders are assigning to the pending outcome:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1865 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Target-rate.png" alt="Target rate" width="501" height="442" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Any gold price low above $1,198 on a fourth Fed rate hike would thus keep the trend of higher lows intact on the first four rate hikes since 2007. In a market that may be commencing a period of several years of additional Fed hikes, this trend bears continual monitoring.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,232.00 (+0.26%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.37 (+0.12%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $918.50 (+0.06%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $820.10 (+0.58%), Dow Jones index 21006.94 (0.26% increase).</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A new Monday morning after French election results and crushing victory of Emmanuel Macron   starts with a fresh look over stock markets and Economic calendar. Our daily market review will bring you all needed news for making well-thought investment decisions during the next 5 days.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metal</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Dollar Index futures are trading higher shortly on Monday. Early pressure came from a rise in the Euro as investors were waiting for the outcome of the French election. The Euro’s inability to follow-through to the upside then helped the dollar recover some of its earlier loss. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices increased on Monday after suffering several weeks loss, weighed down by US dollar and  also as global markets were analyzing Sunday’s French election.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2399.29 (+0.41%) and NASDAQ Index 6100.76 (+0.25%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21006.94 (+0.26%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The outcome of Sunday's closely-watched French presidential election is likely to set the tone for global financial markets this week. Stock analysts expect that the markets will move on from the election, because Emmanuel Macron's victory is definetly "market friendly".</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The week is pretty light as far as market-moving economic reports go. But there is one  report coming up on Friday that will get some attention.That's when the government will report the latest inflation numbers as expressed through the Consumer Price Index. The CPI puts together a list of goods and services and tallies up the price. There are a couple of important indicators coming this week, including CPI and retail sales. </span>

<b>The economic calendar for this week:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Optimism Index, JOLTS job openings for March (Tuesday), April Treasury budget (Wednesday), Jobless Claims, PPI for April (Thursday), Consumer Price Index, Retail Sales (Friday). </span>]]></content>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Dollar Index futures are trading higher on Tuesday.  Increased demand  explained by the expectations for the higher risk assets Fed rate hike in June. Traders are also buying the dollar ahead of speeches by a few Fed members today. Gold prices hit their lowest level in nearly eight weeks on Tuesday as safe-haven demand went down on clarified political worries after Emmanuel Macron’s victory. France's presidential election was one of the largest political risk events affected markets recently. Analysts said Macron's victory calmed investors' worries over a potential breakup of the eurozone or the European Union. Le Pen claimed in her campaign promise to scrap the euro in favor of reintroducing the French franc, that  could have spelled trouble for the European Union.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver price slightly dropped, platinum and palladium prices also fell on Tuesday morning. Investors consider that the combination of a strong dollar, rising global bond yields and a further decline in the volatility index has undermined support for precious metals prices.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US dollar edges down after President Donald Trump's shocking decision to fire FBI director James Comey yesterday. The unexpected news caused the US dollar to downsize recent gains. The dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of six major currencies, edged down 0.2% according to the latest reports. Investors are also concerned that President Trump’s decision to fire FBI Director Comey also had some negative impact on undermine progress in securing congressional support for tax reform. Meanwhile, gold price gained on Wednesday, pulling yellow metal up from its lowest level in the recent weeks. Silver price slightly increased, platinum and palladium prices also gained on Wednesday morning.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street looked set to open lower today as President Trump fired FBI Comey over the handling of Hillary Clinton’s email.

<h2><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar climbed to eight-week highs on Thursday, and stay stable among mixed sentiment. Increasing expectations of an interest rate hike by Fed in June are supporting the US Dollar. Gold price might be sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced. On the other hand, US Dollar position is still questionable by the dismissal of FBI Director James Comey. The market is looking forward to the release of the Producer Price Index today. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold price slightly gained in morning trading, the silver price also increased, platinum and palladium prices rose less than 1%. </span>
<h2><b>Stock Market Today</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2393.26 (-0.27%) and NASDAQ Index 6108.05 (-0.33%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20918.01 (-0.12%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The major stock market indexes are weaker today, continue to stay under pressure after President Trump dismissal of FBI director. Traders will continue to monitor the indexes movement.  Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) crushed in after-market trading  after reported massive losses of $2.2 billion in the first quarter yesterday. Today investors’ attention is focused on The Producer Price Index (PPI) report- a weighted index of prices measured at the wholesale, or producer level. A monthly release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)  shows trends within the wholesale markets manufacturing industries and commodities markets.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,233.20 (+0.45%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.54 (+0.66%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $924.80 (+0.21%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $809.50 (+0.40%), Dow Jones index 20894.24 (0.13% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
US Dollar came under pressure on Friday morning trading, because of the disappointing reports on the American economy. Economic data on US inflation and retail sales for April let down Wall Street expectations. In addition to the dollar weakness, investors were also trading US treasuries, sending yields lower. The markets will be looking for today’s Consumer Price Index Data. Gold prices moved higher on Friday because the recent political events in the U.S. continued to weigh down the US Dollar and boost demand for safe-haven assets like yellow metal. Silver price slightly increased, platinum and palladium prices are also higher.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2390.93 (-0.15%) and NASDAQ Index 6117.39 (+0.03%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20894.24 (-0.13%).</span>

The major U.S. Index futures are trading lower opening on Friday following the release of a Commerce Department showing weaker than expected retail sales growth in April. The US policy uncertainty and weekly news from the new Trump Administration weigh down market stocks, which saw notable weakness in the previous session following news  from the President Trump  about ex-FBI chief. All these events could lead to major disruption to the market. Market attention is also focused on Eurozone data release next week, when  Italian and Eurozone growth figures for the first quarter will be released.  Experts hope to get a clearer picture of US President Donald Trump's direction on important policies that he has yet to specify.

		<title>Technicals vs. Fundamentals</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">To review the primary operating motive of this series of articles: there are hundreds of fundamental factors driving the precious metals markets (currency debasement, potential stock market declines, geopolitical instability, jewelry demand, and industrial fabrication being the major ones). However, no one can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ever</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> know the sum of all fundamental factors impacting a market. To attempt to do so would require complete knowledge of all the factors impacting of each and every single participant in the international market. Such is an impossibility.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the one place in which every market participant comes together – no matter what his or her specific fundamental belief – is in the decision to buy or sell at a specific price point. Price is where the sum of all market participants converge.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, by studying price foremost, we can observe what is actually happening in the market by filtering out the ‘noise’ that so often accompanies fundamental-only analysis. And by observing trends in price – the sum of the buyers and sellers – we can align ourselves with the strongest ones in an attempt to profit.</span>
<h3><strong>Silver Price Update</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us take a good look at silver this week. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver price</a> finished higher last week by $0.13 cents to close at $16.40 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon, a gain of 0.8%.  </span>On the very short-term, the RSI momentum indicator (top of chart), which had registered the most oversold reading since the 2015 bottom, correctly gave us a warning of this bounce that is underway.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1903 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Silver-most-oversold-since-2015-bottom-1024x767.png" alt="Silver-most oversold since 2015 bottom" width="555" height="416" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The question of how far this advance continues remains to be seen. We would like to see <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> regain its broken rising linear trendline (dashed blue), by maintaining a weekly close above $16.50. Such would register the recent break as a “false breakdown” at the most-oversold reading in nearly two years, which would solidify this low as an important medium-term bottom.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if $16.50 fails to be regained again over the next two weeks and silver tops out below the broken trendline, we will consider this a sign of caution. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A sign of caution does not mean we negate the entire thesis for a Q3 – Q4 breakout in the metals. It would suggest, however, that silver could continue to lag throughout the initial stages of gold’s advance, perhaps failing to exceed its 2016 high ($21.25 ) within the same immediate time as when <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> finally exceeds its relative $1,378 peak. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Support lines between $16.75 - $17.25 has been removed from the silver chart above from the version from several weeks ago because, after serving as an important magnet for prices on four successive junctures from last October through the previous week, the zone failed to hold during the most recent decline. For whatever reason, a new group of sellers have shown up and/or buyers did not appear within that range as we had observed them previously, and so we must adjust our perspective and outlook accordingly.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the positive side, because this level is no longer a support zone, it will also no longer be a resistance level as silver moves higher. Sellers should be largely absent within this region.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is little in the way of resistance until $17.75, which becomes our target on a recapturing of the broken blue trendline at $16.50. This was the pivot low from the April correction.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the long-run, we have targets much higher than $17.75. However, over the short run this should serve as short-term resistance. </span>Silver must at minimum consolidate above Important Support labeled at $15.75 to keep the bull market thesis intact during the remainder of 2017. A break below this level would signal a major red flag for gold and cause us to have to rework the 2017 – 2020 long-term model.
<h3><b>SLW / SLV Ratio</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We often use the ratio between large-cap silver miners and silver bullion itself to gauge short-term pivot points in the metals. Silver Wheaton (SLW) is our large-cap miner of choice, a sector leader across most timeframes. Below we update the chart, with SLW on top and SLV (silver bullion proxy) immediately below. Note that SLW now is firmly within the 2017 mid-consolidation (above the green support band), while silver itself is well below its correlated price zone. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, SLW often discounts short-term price movements that will not last in the underlying silver market.</span>
<p class="aligncenter"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1904 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SLW-well-above-March-lows.png" alt="SLW well above March lows" width="440" height="456" /></p>
<p class="aligncenter"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This leading indicator is calling for a continued recovery in silver over the intermediate-term, although please note that this signal can sometimes occur early, i.e. immediate weakness in silver can occur for the first few days, and then the recovery begins. Those looking to do short-term trading in silver should use other confirming technical indicators such as momentum and trendlines analysis.</span></p>

		<title>Daily Market Review - May, 15</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,236.00 (+0.34%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.79 (+1.13%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $940.20 (+1.06%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $814.15 (+0.32%), Dow Jones index 20968.90 (0.35% increase).</i></b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a new week after President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey and his administration offered differing rationales for the move. Now there is a significant expectations about even more staff shakeup. Our daily market review will bring you all needed news for making well-thought investment decisions during the next 5 days.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Dollar slipped on Monday, losing ground against so-called commodity currencies.The greenback also lost ground against other major currencies, including the euro. The dollar also suffered against the rising oil prices. Gold price rises up Monday as weaker-than-expected economic data and US Dollar start this week. Traders are expecting an almost 100 per cent probability of an interest rate increase in June, that could affect the yellow metal price. Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.  Among the other precious metals: Silver is up around 16.00 per ounce, platinum climbed over 1%, palladium also rose.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2401.61 (+0.45%) and NASDAQ Index 6144.91 (+0.38%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20968.90 (+0.35%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two key economic numbers –IIP and inflation – which were released last week are likely to have an influence on the domestic stock market this week. US data on Friday showed a smaller-than-expected 0.4% increase in April retail sales from the previous month, while a disappointing report on consumer prices raised concerns about the retail sector and the broader economy. </span>

<b>What to watch in the market in the week ahead?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, the economic calendar is almost barren, with only a few pieces of housing market data worth noting early on. The political schedule, as always, unpredictable, but markets have more or less moved on.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House focused on the potential staff shakeup after fired James Corney. The main concern to White House staffing changes continues to be what it always has been -- who are the replacements? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional geopolitical news: North Korea said on Monday it had successfully conducted a newly developed mid-to-long range missile test on Sunday, and pointed at verifying the capability to carry a "large scale heavy nuclear warhead." </span>

<b>Economic data for this week: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empire State Index (</span><b>Monday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Industrial production (</span><b>Tuesday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), </span><b>Wednesday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">-No major economic data, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekly jobless claims, Philly FED Index (</span><b>Thursday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Advance services report </span><b>(Friday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span>]]></content>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US dollar is tumbling on Tuesday morning, pressured by weak US data and the news that President Trump may have shared the sensitive information with Russians officials about Islamic State threat. Mr.Trump’s tweet reported on Tuesday morning: “As President, I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining....to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS &amp; terrorism.” weighed down the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies and added concerns to the US Dollar nearest forecast.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold price rose on Tuesday as the dollar became weaker and because of the slow economic activity in the United States recent reports. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors' expectations of a US rate increase in June fell to 74 per cent compared to 84 per cent last week and provide a great prospective for gold price in the short-term forecast. Among the other precious metals: silver is up over $16.00 per ounce, platinum and palladium prices also climbed today.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2404.28 (+0.08%) and NASDAQ Index 6157.57 (+0.13%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21007.75 (+0.12%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The main US Stock Market Indexes  started trading higher in early pre-market day. Data on housing starts for April and data on industrial production will be released today.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices traded higher and gained over 3% after Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to extend production cuts in 2018.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The market reaction to the latest news about shared sensitive intelligence obtained from a close meeting of President Trump with Russian foreign minister and an ambassador was muted. Analytics doubt this news just added lack of enthusiasm that the President will be able to deliver on plans to boost infrastructure spending and cut taxes.</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - May, 17</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,256.20 (+1.33%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.06 (+0.82%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $950.30 (+0.69%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $787.70 (-1.72%), Dow Jones index 20979.75 (0.01% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar Index is being weighed down today by weak economic data and lack of optimism over higher American growth and inflation continuing to fade following a  round of disappointing housing data. Investors had the high hopes for Mr. Trump’s vision of America, but the latest scandal about shared information with Russian officials puts his plans on hold or may see them implemented at the worst. The New York Times yesterday reported James Comey took notes of a meeting where President Trump asked him to stop investigating into National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, who allegedly contacted with Russian officials during last year's election campaign.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> price opened higher on Wednesday, as the yellow metal benefited from the weaker Dollar.  The weaker than expected housing starts report and weaker than expected retail sales report last week have caused the higher gold prices. Among the other precious metals: <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver</a> is up over $17.00 per ounce, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> prices also climbed today, meanwhile, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">palladium</a> dropped down.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2400.67 (-1.31%) and NASDAQ Index 6169.87 (+0.33%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20979.75 (-0.01%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Concern that U.S.President Donald Trump's reform agenda could be slowed down, and that Trump himself could even face the threat of impeachment after being involved in Russian scandal, added to disappointing U.S. economic data on Wednesday  the lower main stock market indexes today. The main indexes were on track for their largest daily declines in nearly two months. Some investors still suggest that a market reaction seems muted to what’s going on in Washington, and has more focus on Washington’s ability to push tax reform.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices strengthened on Wednesday ahead of U.S. crude inventory data that could give investors a clue as to whether an OPEC-led output cut is making progress in reducing a persistent global supply overhang.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,253.50 (-0.59%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.63 (-1.36%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $935.00 (-0.95%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $764.00 (-2.05%), Dow Jones index 20620.07 (0.06% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. dollar index has moved to its daily high on Thursday and is trading slightly up ahead of midday. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> price opened lower this morning but still remains generally well bid in the wake of the yesterday’s solid gains and the 5-day rally. The precious yellow metal stays underpinned by haven demand amid ongoing political turmoil in the US. Among other precious metals: <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver</a> price slipped from multi-week highs today, declining below $17.00 per ounce; <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">palladium</a> prices are also down.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metals analysts see potential for more gold gains over the next weeks as the political turmoil continues in Washington D.C. and may perhaps reduce any monetary tightening by the Federal Open Market Committee. They characterized gold as a market which “needs a story” in order to keep rallying, and since right now there are suspicions that there will be more coming out of the White House, there might be a continued safe-haven bid for gold.</span>

<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks opened lower on Thursday due to concerns about the future of the President Donald Trump and his ability to deliver on his pro-growth agenda. However, over the trading day all three stock market indexes held higher, rebounding from the brutal selloff: S&P 500 2360.76 (+0.16%) and NASDAQ Index 6033.35 (+0.37%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20620.07 (+0.06%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although stocks recorded their biggest drop in eight months, some technical analysts examined them by numbers and affirmed that they don't see a major sell-off ahead. In fact, those stock market analysts expect a shallow pullback at best, even as stocks dropped yesterday on worries about whether the Trump administration will be able to push its pro-growth agenda through Congress.  Anyhow, there are signs that investors remain skeptical, and both caution and volatility may stay high with the existing political turmoil in Washington.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Dollar Index lost all its potential previous gains on Friday. The dollar got a small boost from better than expected reports on jobless claims and manufacturing index earlier. The U.S. dollar index hit a low of 97.481, its lowest since Nov. 9 this week. Gold prices corrected this week, because investors were buying gold as a refuge from the volatility and of course the weaker US dollar. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> price opened slightly lower on Friday, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> is up, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> prices also climbed today, meanwhile, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">palladium</a> dropped down a few points.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2381.56 (+0.67%) and NASDAQ Index 6095.98 (+0.67%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20748.86 (+0.41%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The main U.S. stock market indexes advanced on Friday, driven by political uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump’s presidency, but still, on the track for weekly loses. The market is looking to stabilize as no new political news hit this morning headlines, suggesting that investors are willing to play out the political turmoil without pushing the panic switch.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices are higher today, if we look at what's happened since the beginning of the year; market tried to trade the OPEC production cuts, the big draws in the U.S. inventories, and it got reduced once in April and again in May.</span>

		<title>US Dollar Breaks Down on Trump Investigation</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The big news across the currency markets this week was the large drop in the US dollar, which fell over 2% against a basket of currencies representing the US dollar index. The drop came on the heels of the announcement that the US government will launch a special investigation into alleged Russian connections with President Trump during last November’s election. While the investigation may take years to complete (and it could be a propaganda campaign by opposing political forces), the market has cast an initial vote by selling the US dollar in favor of other currencies, most notably the euro and yen.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our focus here is not to dwell on the world political scene, but to illustrate the market reaction to these events, and to show how the currency crosspairs may impact the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">precious metals prices</a>.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1936 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/US-Dollar-Index.png" alt="US Dollar Index" width="1023" height="608" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar has now negated all of the post-Trump rally, returning round-trip to the 97 level on the dollar index, a process which has taken six months.</span>

It is important to note that our analysis began to give hints that something negative was brewing for the dollar back in January, strictly based on interpretations of the chart. We observed lower lows forming in the dollar, and a failure to sustain a breakout to new highs in December, which came after a 9-year advance.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This failure of a market to move higher after an attempted breakout constitutes a “false breakout” in our technical model. When such a false move comes after a 9-year advance, it may signal exhaustion in a market, and a pending trend reversal in the opposite direction.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not until now, four months later, that the news has finally synched with the technical hints. This is almost always the case in technical-based market analysis: the move is observed first on the charts, and the news arrives some weeks or months later to explain the reasons why.</span>
<h3><b>Short-Term Technical Considerations</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The rising trendline from May 2016 has now clearly been broken to the downside (turquoise color, above). The retest failed a week prior (callout), and a continuation lower is now in process for the dollar.</span>

<b>Our initial target for the dollar is 95.5 on the index</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, highlighted above in green. This target is derived from measuring the amplitude of the failed move above the 99.5 former support level to the 103.5 peak (4.0), and subtracting this value below the breakdown point. The real-world interpretation of the target is that we expect an equal number of sellers to cut their losses below 99.5 as those who attempted to go long the dollar above this level. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a confirming target, 96 on the index is also the 50% mid-point of the prior consolidation, which ranged from 92 to just above 100. When we have two technical targets within 0.5 points of one another, it increases the probability of the range being hit.</span>
<h3><b>Dollar Intermediate-Term</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 95.5 level is an initial downside target only. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have made the case in past issues that the false breakout above 100, which consisted of the entirety of the previous six months of post-Trump action, more importantly constitutes a long-term reversal after a 9-year advance in the USD. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While some level of bounce is expected after the initial 95.5 target is hit, we anticipate further intermediate and long-term downside remains. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, this is a central component of the thesis for a precious metals bull market, as the strongest gains to come in years ahead should arive from a growing world-wide recognition that the world’s present “reserve currency” is a depreciating store of value.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After a bounce at 95.5, our secondary target will be 92 on the dollar index. This level is critically significant for the US currency, as we can see from the 15-year chart below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1937 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/US-Dollar-index-2003-now-1024x609.png" alt="US Dollar index 2003- now" width="840" height="500" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 92 secondary target represents important long-term horizontal support (double black lines), which can be observed from the multiple spikes lower toward that level in 2015 – 2016, and more significantly in the resistance zones which date back to 2004 – 2005 (far left). Further, just below this level, 91.2 represents the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the entire 2008 – 2017 advance (light grey lines).  Again, we have multple technical targets in this 91-92 region, and so the zone will take on important consideration.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The question that remains to be seen is: what sort of bounce will the market take between the initial target of 95.5 and the secondary target of 92? In an impulsive market decline, this sort of initial bounce may not last more than 1-3 months before sustained selling re-emerges.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of the exact legnth of the dollar bounce at 95.5</span><b> any price action that remains below 100.5 on the index will keep the technical criteria for a long-term top valid in the US currency.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A test of the 92 secondary target would thus be anticipated for Q3 – Q4 2017. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A break below 92 would be a strong confirming indicator of a new bear market materializing. Longer-term, we expect that the dollar will eventually make new all-time lows below 72, with the timing for this likely into the mid-years of the forthcoming decade.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Spot Price today</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,264.20 (+0.18%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.36 (+0.63%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $960.10 (+0.58%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $777.75 (+0.65%), Dow Jones index 20 907.73 (0.07% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar index was little changed on Tuesday morning. With a light economic schedule for today, the investors’ focus is still on the troubling political developments. Analytics considered that because of a huge drop down in British Pound following the terrorist attack in Manchester, US Dollar may gain some points, but nothing actually changed in the greenback. It seems that US Dollar cannot get out of its weak way. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metals prices are also relatively quiet, despite tragic news coming out of Manchester, England. Since last week gold price advanced 2.2% over Trump's alleged links to Russia and his firing of former Federal Bureau of Investigation Chief James Comey, which raised concerns about his ability to push through promised fiscal stimulus. Among other precious metals: <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> is slightly higher today, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">palladium</a> prices also rose.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2394.64 (+0.03%) and NASDAQ Index 6128.02 (-0.09%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 20 907.73 (+0.07%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The main US stock market Indexes rose on Tuesday morning, European markets generally recovered from an early dip that followed Manchester news. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The President Trump administration is set to unveil its budget Tuesday. The new budget may cut hundreds of billions of dollars from programs such as Medicaid, food stamps, and disability insurance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Census Bureau will report new home sales data for April later today. Oil prices reversed early losses that followed news reports outlining a 10-year, $3.59 trillion packages of spending cuts charted by the White House. The plan reportedly proposed selling about half of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. </span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar was little changed against other major currencies on Wednesday, as investors awaited the results of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting later in the day. The greenback regained some ground as investors turned their attention to the upcoming minutes of the Fed’s meeting, with hopes of further indications on the pace of future rate hikes. The U.S. dollar has been weakened recently following a media buzz of revelations surrounding the FBI’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in November’s U.S. presidential election. Gold price lost some points on Wednesday, and investors expect gold prices to trade lower today after a recent rally. Among other precious metals: silver is slightly lower today, platinum and palladium prices also lost points.</span>

U.S. stocks traded slightly higher on Wednesday, though activity was subdued, ahead of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting, which could doubt about a June interest-rate increase.

White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney defended Tuesday the major cuts to social safety-net programs included in President Trump’s budget proposal, saying there’s still plenty of funding for people who truly need help.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
US Dollar weakened on Thursday as investors heard the results of the last Federal Reserve meeting showed policymakers agreed they should hold off on more aggressive interest rate hikes.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin jumped more than 11 percent to all-time high on Thursday. Bitcoin is close to hitting a price that could see a 47 percent correction, according to one analyst, following a huge rally for the cryptocurrency that has led it to record highs.

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,268.30 (+0.83%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.30 (+1.21%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $970.30 (+1.64%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $782.80 (+1.46%), Dow Jones index 21,077.12 (0.03% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
The U.S. dollar was flat yesterday but rose on Friday against the other currencies as crude-oil prices fell following an agreement by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producers to extend production cuts. The greenback was supported by Thursday's better than expected U.S. initial jobless claims data. Gold price hit more than one-week high on Friday. Investors suggest gold will stay an alternative investment during this political and financial uncertainty. Among the other precious metals: silver is slightly higher today and on track to its biggest weekly rise since mid-April, platinum and palladium prices also gained points.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2415.55 (+0.02%) and NASDAQ Index 6208.89 (+0.04%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21 077.12 (-0.03%).</span>

U.S. stock markets will be closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day. Main market indexes flipped between small gains and losses today, as investors struggled to find fresh reasons to push shares to records ahead of a holiday weekend.

Price of bitcoin rebounded today after a small drop yesterday. Most major cryptocurrencies have been on an upwards trajectory in recent months, with bitcoin hitting new all-time highs in quick succession.

This week, on his first trip abroad, the U.S. President traveled to Saudi Arabia, Israel, Rome and Brussels. Now Donald Trump is attending G7 in Italy (Sicily). In Saudi Arabia, the President announced a $110 billion arms deal and signed deals “potentially” worth more than $200 billion over the next 10 years. Trump claimed that he signed historic agreements with the Kingdom that will invest almost $400 billion in these two countries and create many thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia.

		<title>Daily Market Review - May, 30</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,265.10 (-0.26%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.51 (+1.20%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $947.00 (-1.50%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $803.50 (+0.17%), Dow Jones index 21,032.02 (0.23% decrease).</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a new week after a long Memorial Day weekend. Global stock markets started weaker on Tuesday ahead of a busy week on the data front including consumer confidence and nonfarm payrolls numbers. There will be two important reports this week: consumer confidence figures on Tuesday and the May job report on Friday.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index futures are trading lower today after a long weekend and a small rebound last week. Traders are waiting for U.S. economic reports and consider that the dollar could get a more profound boost in upcoming economic data. However, some market analysts suggest that US Dollar still needs an extraordinary amount of monetary support. The precious metals have turned lower on Tuesday’s early ranges. Meanwhile, risk surrounding the upcoming  Britain’s election, the prospect of early elections in Italy and worries over Greek debt could support gold.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver gained a few points; platinum dropped down over 1%, palladium marked one of its late highest levels since April.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2411.79 (-0.17%) and NASDAQ Index 6205.35 (-0.08%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21 032.02 (-0.23%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks mostly edged lower from record levels on Tuesday, even the market’s uptrend was seen as remaining intact following the latest rally. Much of the market’s gain over the past several months has come on hopes that the Donald Trump administration would push through legislation on taxes and regulation that would boost corporate profits and accelerate growth. The analysts say that progress still need to justify current levels.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last recovery in stocks was also coincided with Trump’s first trip as president abroad, causing some to speculate that investor focus on the Russia probes may return when the president returns to U.S. soil.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the busy economic data will keep investors busy during this week.</span>

<b>Economic data for this week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: personal income, consumer spending, consumer confidence index </span><b>(Tuesday),</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pending home sales index </span><b>(Wednesday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Weekly jobless claim, ADP employment report </span><b>(Thursday),</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Unemployment rate, May job report </span><b>(Friday).</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span>

		<title><![CDATA[Gold & Silver Price Updates]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> closed higher by $14 or 1.2% to finish at $1,268 for the week. The precious metal is now close enough to its key long-term 2011-2017 downtrend that we can again call this advance another attempt to overcome the critical level. The last attempt to do so came on April 17 at $1,290 per ounce – a level which was exceeded for a few hours before failing to hold it throughout the overnight trading hours. As the trendline is downward sloping, the level to overcome inherently is falling every week, and we thus shift our focus to the $1,280 level, as shown below by the most recent arrow just above that long-term (magenta color) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trendline.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2004 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Gold-2008-Present-1024x766.png" alt="Gold 2008-Present" width="840" height="628" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have stated in the past that our target upon a successful breakout of the pennant-shaped consolidation will be $330 above or below the apex of the consolidation, which is $1,205: thus, either $1,535 or $875, within 6-12 months of the breaking point. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will have much more analysis on what short-term swings to expect </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">within</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this significant movement once the break of the pattern finally happens. For now, let us continue to focus on the pattern’s resolution itself, and the $1,280 figure that would be required at this juncture.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2005 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2011-2017-Downtrend-1-1024x766.png" alt="2011-2017 Downtrend" width="840" height="628" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most probable scenario we see is that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> again fails to break out this week, and continues to grind in the low-mid $1,200’s through Q3, in what should be the final exhaustive consolidation to wear out the last remnants of the “hot money” that became interested in the sector only after 2016’s first-half surge.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, at our firm we are already largely invested, and that is because in a bull market surprises should be expected to the upside, i.e. a breakout sooner – perhaps by mid-summer – rather than later in the year. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While in the midst of a lengthy consolidation it is difficult to imagine that anything else will ever occur. Frustration grows as the sector oscillates without much definitive movement. This is exactly the time to go against the herd and not succumb to such limited perspective.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The price action that occurs after a consolidation breaks will have little resemblance to the price action within the consolidation itself. This is one of the clearest consolidation patterns we have ever observed in the gold market. Let us remain alert.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The technical action in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> is encouraging for the entire sector. Gold’s cousin rose $0.53 cents or 3.1%, to close at $17.32 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday. Having regained the rising trendline successfully, we can now call the final portion of silver’s plunge into early May below $16.50 a “false breakdown” as can be seen on the chart.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2007 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Silver-oversold-1024x766.png" alt="Silver oversold" width="840" height="628" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is minor resistance at $17.75 which may halt the current advance – although if and when gold breaks its primary consolidation, silver should rise with strength such that it may simply ignore most of the previous short-term resistance levels that are visible on the chart above. On a successful gold breakout, momentum indicators and/or leading signals from the silver mining complex will be more important for gauging the next target of an intermediate high.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To the downside, we would see a break of support at $15.75 as a major red flag that the expected bull market advance may be delayed beyond 2018.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Longer-term, however, the clarity of silver’s basing pattern could not be more apparent. <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver prices</a> are now beginning their fifth year below the $25/oz region. Downward momentum is largely exhausted after the 73% drop from 2011 – 2015. The longer that prices remain in this basing pattern, the stronger that the move higher will eventually be once $25 is breached. We must remember that at each swing higher and lower within a basing pattern, metal is being transferred from weak hands to strong.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our general expectation is that silver may continue with this basing process with an upward bias through mid-2018.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2008 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Silver-2011-2017-1-1024x925.png" alt="Silver 2011-2017" width="840" height="759" />

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,267.30 (+0.32%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.42 (-0.17%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $952.50 (+0.31%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $815.95 (+0.97%), Dow Jones index 21,025.66 (0.02% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar continues to lose its value against other currencies weighted by a drop in U.S. Treasury yields amid a cautious global sentiment with political worries in Europe. </span>The dollar index has been weak over the last two weeks on concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. Gold price is slightly changed today, boosted by U.S. economic data. All market analyst’s focus is on an interest<span style="font-weight: 400;"> rate hike by the Federal Reserve next month. U.S. consumer spending report released yesterday recorded its biggest increase in four months in April and monthly inflation rebounded, pointing to improving domestic demand that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. U.S. employment data coming this Friday and it could also affect the Fed rate hike decision next month. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the other precious metals: silver lost a few points; platinum was up in early session, palladium also gained today.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2414.49 (+0.05%) and NASDAQ Index 6217.15 (+0.21%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21 025.66 (-0.02%).
Wall Street opened slightly higher on Wednesday, but Dow Jones Industrial Average quickly slipped later in trading.
Oil prices slumped more than 2% in early trade.The American Petroleum Institute releases its weekly inventory estimates later today, followed by the Energy Information Administration's oil report on Thursday.
President Donald Trump tweeted today that he will announce his decision follow about pulling the United States out of a global pact to fight climate change in a few days. This move promises to deepen a rift with U.S. allies.The decision will put the United States in league with Syria and Nicaragua as the world's only non-participants in the Paris Climate Agreement.

		<title>Daily Market Review - June,1</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,264.90 (-0.41%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.16 (-1.33%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $935.90 (-1.79%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $829.30 (+0.82%), Dow Jones index 21,002.99 (0.03% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar pushed higher against other major currencies on Thursday, supported by the release of U.S. jobs data and as investors are now expecting Friday’s highly anticipated nonfarm payrolls report. There is a lot of disappointment about the pace of reforms, tax cuts, regulation reductions in the U.S. and while the Fed can hike interest rates in June, they won't be able to increase interest rates again for the rest of this year. When thinking about the risks to dollar predictions over the coming year, a significant majority of strategists said it was skewed more to the downside. Gold edged lower on Thursday but held near the five-week highs hit in the previous session, as expectations that the US Federal Reserve will hike interest rates this month still weighed down on gold prices but geopolitical uncertainty provided some support. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Among other precious metals: silver fell 0.1%, platinum dropped down, palladium, which hit a four-week high, gained a few points.  </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened slightly higher S&amp;P 500 2416.97 (+0.21%) and NASDAQ Index 6223.96 (+0.41%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21 002.99(-0.03%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street opened higher on Thursday, but quickly turned mixed in a busy session stirred by late-season earnings news and a heavy economic calendar.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump is expected to announce his decision on Thursday on whether the United  States will continue to be part of the global pact to fight climate change. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices climbed 1.3% Thursday after data from the American Petroleum Institute had shown U.S. crude inventories fell last week. Investors are keeping a close eye on U.S. production after OPEC and other major producers decided to extend their production cut agreement last week for nine additional months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, investors are likely to hold off all moves until they will see  US jobs data today (ADP employment) and Friday (non-farm payrolls). </span>

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">weekly jobless claims, ADP employment report.</span>

		<title>Why is Bitcoin going up?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bitcoin</strong> is the hot topic recently after the Bitcoin price reached a historical high of over USD 2,700 on May 25th, marking an 180% year-on-year increase. Speculations are blooming around the subject. However, the certainty is that for those who made $10 investment in bitcoin in 2010, now they would have $7.5 million. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s review facts first and then talk about the reasons for Bitcoin behavior. </span>
<h3><b>Bitcoin ABC:</b></h3>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin founder - Satoshi Nakamoto.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximum supply of bitcoin is set at 21 million.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It does not pertain to any regulatory institution or country.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first transaction made with Bitcoin: May 22nd, 2010 - a programmer bought two pizzas worth 10,000 bitcoins.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2010 a bitcoin was worth 0.03 cent.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 25th, 2017, it is worth little over 2,700 dollars.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan passed recently a law that accepts Bitcoins as legal currency and payment method.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Why is Bitcoin going up?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Opinions are dispersed, but it is obvious there is no right answer, rather it seems a serious of favorable events caused the bitcoin price up, following the positive, ascending trend noticed for some time now (means, analysts expect bitcoin price continues to grow).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From most of the reviews, Japan is passing the law on accepting bitcoins as currency and payment method has been definitory in raising demand for bitcoins. Currently, more that 40% of bitcoin trade is done in Japan and Korea in Yeni. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some analysts explain that bitcoin price is all about supply and demand. Considering all political uncertainty in the US with Trump, in Europe with Brexit, in Asia with China and bad loans, bitcoin becomes sought out as a “safe haven”, which is not regulated by any country and is considered safe in such times of distress. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is possible that now we see a price bubble, result of economic turbulences and market reaction to events enumerated above, as there are the skeptics who expect bitcoin prices to drop even by 50% in the next period, meaning around USD 1,500, us witnessing the so-called “correction” in prices. On another hand, such event can even be perceived as a great time for investment in bitcoins. Either way, in the long run, the positive trend is expected to be kept. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if more states would follow Japan’ example on accepting bitcoins, this could make the cryptocurrency an even more attractive investment, and it would draw the ones who previously avoided it due to the high risk and price swings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If there were another major financial crisis, we would see bitcoin prices rising even higher, as these are one of the safest investments out there. Bitcoin now is somewhat regarded as “digital gold” by some investors. There are many similarities, they're both issued through a mining process (one real, the other simulated), they are both finite, and they are both seen as a store of value. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why if you’re like Bitcoin, chances are you may also want to diversify your portfolio with gold. However, turning Bitcoin into gold can be difficult, time-consuming and expensive. That’s why Bullion Exchanges offers a great variety of precious metals bullion and accept Bitcoin as a paying option. </span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - June,2</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,275.40 (+0.62%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.48 (+0.63%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $940.80 (+0.61%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $839.30 (+1.47%), Dow Jones index 21,144.18 (0.65% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar dropped after yesterday jobs report released. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the US economy added 138,000 nonfarm jobs in May, which was below economists' expectations of 182,000. Investors will be looking for further clues on the timing of rate rises in US non-farm payroll data due later in the day. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Gold prices slightly higher today, following a weaker than expected U.S. jobs report. Among the other precious metals: silver is slightly higher, platinum is also up, palladium has gained a few points and following its best weekly performance.  </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2430.06 (+0.76%) and NASDAQ Index 6246.83 (+0.78%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21 144.18(+0.65%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stock-market indexes hit intraday records in early Friday trade, though gains were limited after a weaker-than-expected May jobs report that undermined confidence in the economy. Despite the unexpectedly low print on the jobs report, expectations for a rate hike in June are still relevant.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, President Trump confirmed on Thursday afternoon. The widely anticipated decision comes in spite of a broad push from American companies, business leaders, politicians and even many in the president's inner circle to remain in. Hundreds of companies came out in support of the Paris climate agreement, sealed in December 2015. More than 300 businesses in November signed an open letter calling on Trump and Congress to stay in the pact, including Nike, General Mills, Tiffany &amp; Co, eBay, Gap, Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The big question now is how other countries will respond to Mr. Trump’s withdrawal. The US could face serious diplomatic repercussions for leaving. Europe, China, and other countries may decide to withhold cooperation on issues the Trump administration cares about, like a trade for example.</span>

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonfarm payroll, Unemployment rate, average hourly earnings. </span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,283.20 (+0.15%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.67 (+0.11%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $962.00 (+0.45%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $848.85 (+0.50%), Dow Jones index 21,184.95 (0.11% decrease).</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a new week ahead with slipped market on Monday as investors tried to analyze potential market-moving events after a weekend's terror attack in the U.K. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terror incident comes just days ahead of the U.K. election on Thursday.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a busy week in Washington: President Trump will try to focus on Administration Infrastructure before the FBI former James Come’s highly anticipated testimony will be announced on Thursday. This week will also deliver the U.K. general election and a European Central Bank meeting. </span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar began this week slightly higher, giving the investors promise that it could gain some points during this important week ahead. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t is a holiday in parts of Europe ( Germany and Switzerland), so US Dollar today supported by close European markets.  Although excitement is not until Thursday's ECB meeting, UK election, and the testimony of former US FBI Director Comey. This week the European Central Bank (ECB) governing council will meet to fix monetary policy. Geopolitical risk is set to dominate US markets this week and may weigh down US Dollar again. Gold price rose at the beginning of the week and hit a six-week high supported by the disappointing U.S. jobs data on Friday. Among the other precious metals: silver is slightly changed, platinum price gained a few points, palladium also hit its strongest level in recent weeks.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2436.04 (-0.12%) and NASDAQ Index 6300.66 (-0.10%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21184.95 (-0.11%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks were slightly lower in early trading on Monday as oil prices fell after Arab states cut ties with Qatar over alleged support for Islamists and Iran, while markets mostly shrugged off the weekend attacks in London. Investors feared that the cutting of ties could hamper a global deal to reduce oil production. The attack in London on Saturday was the third in Britain in less than three months and came at a time when the country is heading for its general national election on Thursday.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The British snap election will be held on Thursday, June 8.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the US, fired FBI Director James Comey is set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday about his conversations with President Trump regarding suspicion of Russian interference in the 2016 election. His testimony is expected to drive further moves in equities and the dollar in a recurrence of market swings last month.</span>

<b>Economic data for this week: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factory orders, ISM Nonmanufacturing Index </span><b>(Monday),</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Job openings </span><b>(Tuesday), </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer Credit</span><b> (Wednesday), </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekly jobless claim</span><b> (Thursday), </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wholesales Inventories</span><b> (Friday). </b>]]></content>

		<title>The US Bond Market – the 800-Pound Gorilla</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The “800-pound gorilla” in the investment world is not the US stock market, nor yet the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> market – it is the US treasury bond market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US bond market, at over $40 trillion in value, is much larger than the US stock market, which comes in at a little over $25 trillion. The longest-dated component of the US treasury market is the 30-year bond.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The chart below shows the price of the US 30-year bond from 1980 through the present. Readers should recall that interest rates move inversely to price – so as the price has been rising steadily for the past 36 years, interest rates have been falling this entire time, to a generational low of 2.1% last summer.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2079 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/US-30-Year-Bond-Price-1024x609.png" alt="US 30-Year Bond Price" width="578" height="344" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we can see, investors have had an insatiable appetite for US debt over the past 36 years. We here see a market which was following a long-term orderly rising channel, which then started to take on characteristics of a mania from 2015 – 2016. During these recent years, bond prices began a parabolic curve higher (blue callout), corresponding to a willingness by investors to accept negative real returns for the privilege of holding US debt. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The textbook footprint of a mania on a chart is a long-term orderly market breaking higher into a parabolic curve. This is exactly what was witnessed from 2014 through mid-2016 in the longest-dated US bond.</span>
<h3><b>Parabolic Curve Broken</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The parabolic curve was then broken in last summer’s decline in bond prices, indicating a long-term top was put into place. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet bonds are once again in the media for having had several positive months in a row, as we can see below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2080 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Treasury-Bond-Price.png" alt="Treasury Bond Price" width="704" height="468" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If our analysis is correct, </span><b>any rally in bond prices from this point onward should be counter-trend in nature only</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Last summer’s highs at 175 should not be regained for bond prices. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will have strong confirmation within the next six months if bond prices make a new low below 145. Much stronger confirmation will come from a breakdown below the lower rising channel line (magenta color) near 135, which would be expected at any time within the next 12-36 months.</span>
<h3><b>Bond Market Critical to US &amp; Western Standard of Living</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The one backdrop which most investors alive today have known is rising bond prices and the corresponding falling interest rates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us assume that the average American begins to follow the financial markets and to consider investing at age 22. This means that anyone born after 1958 knows only falling interest rates as a broad macroeconomic backdrop.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every political and technological advance that has happened in the US and allied western nations since 1980 has occurred amidst falling interest rates and ever-cheaper credit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, total debt in the United States exceeded gross domestic product for the first time in 2011, a trend which does not appear to be improving:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2081 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FRED-1024x342.png" alt="FRED" width="840" height="281" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This imbalance can only happen amidst a backdrop of investors willing to ever finance US debt by continuously purchasing US-bonds. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet on the 36-year chart above, we show what appears to be the key characteristics of a market in the process of putting in a long-term top.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How will the United States finance this debt amidst a rising interest rate backdrop? The interest expense for federal debt alone in 2016 was $432 billion. Can we imagine if interest rates double just too historic norms that existed ten years ago? With the addition of record new debt this year, the annual interest rate expense alone could easily exceed $1 trillion within the next 3 years.</span>

<b>How will the United States fund an interest expense growing exponentially if the bond market has put in a long-term top?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, no politician wins re-election in a democracy by cutting funding to constituents.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No one stays in office for long by cutting benefits to the sick, the elderly, the poor, veterans, schools, or for infrastructure. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, the solution to the funding gap is: the Federal Reserve will be forced to print money.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The central bank will be forced to create sufficient money to “monetize” US bonds to cover whatever cannot be raised by taxes alone.</span>
<h3><b>Monetization of Debt is Inflation</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Monetization is the direct creation of new money to finance debt – and it will represent a hidden tax on those least able to afford it, namely the poor and middle-class on fixed incomes. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When inflation drives up the prices of necessities such as food and shelter, these classes have no means to protect themselves, as they are forced to buy those items no matter the cost. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, those with disposable income can protect themselves and even benefit from periods of inflation if they invest properly by owning real assets. For this reason, inflation is a regressive tax, in that it steals quality of life from the poor and gives to the rich.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the policy of most Western governments and central banks today.</span>
<h3><b>Back to the Bond Market</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, we come back to the bond market. The theoretical fundamentals of a declining bond market have been hypothesized by various writers for many decades… yet it is only now that we are seeing actual topping signals on the chart itself.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it possible that the parabolic curve seen on the chart above was simply a warmup for an even more manic final blow-off to come? Ultimately anything is possible in the markets. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But if that is going to happen, we will see it on the chart very soon, as bond prices should explode higher and clearly exceed the 175 level for 6-18 months before they come crashing down. Fundamentally, this could only correspond with real interest rates plunging into the negative 2-3% range, as investors would “pay” the government for the privilege of loaning money to them.</span>

<b>Our best assessment is that the top has already occurred. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A parabolic curve in the largest bond market in the world that exceeded the 36-year rising channel has already broken down. It would be rare to see this curve regained again.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> investors, this market bears our foremost attention over the next year. We should be able to plainly see a breakdown of the long-term rising channel on the chart when it occurs. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This will be a sign of a multi-decade top in no uncertain terms. Decades of rising interest rates should follow… and amidst a backdrop of a government caught between a rock (unfunded debt) and a hard place (printing money), we know that in the fiat era a government will always choose the later.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term thesis for protection by precious metals ownership is thus still in its infancy. </span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. dollar was mixed on Tuesday morning but ended weaker against the bucket of the major currencies and the pound ahead of a U.K. general election this week. The latest analysts reports recorded that overall long, non-commercial dollar positions have declined to the lowest level for nine months. Gold price touched its highest level in the recent weeks today following the weak dollar and uncertainty in Asian stock markets ahead of a UK national election and a European Central Bank meeting later this week. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the other precious metals: silver is trading higher, platinum gained more than 1%, palladium marked its strongest level since September. </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2429.46 (-0.27%) and NASDAQ Index 6284.86 (-0.20%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21128.31 (-0.26%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street indexes edged lower on Tuesday, as investors turned cautious in the wake of geopolitical events dominating this week.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most investors are in a risk-off mode as they just wait for the outcome of the U.K. general election, a policy meeting of the European Central Bank and former Federal Bureau of Investigation boss James Comey’s testimony to a Senate panel on Thursday.</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - June, 7</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,292.00 (-0.27%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.71 (-0.33%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $952.40 (-1.17%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $839.65 (-2.07%), Dow Jones index 21,180.46 (0.21% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar Index rose against the euro due to reports that the European Central Bank was preparing to cut its inflation forecasts on Thursday. Nervous investors turned their attention into low-risk bonds and other safe-haven assets on worries linked to Britain’s general election, the European Central Bank’s policy meeting and highly awaited FBI Director James Comey’s testimony. Concerns about the situation have added to market doubts over the Trump administration's ability to deliver a promised boost to growth and recently weighed on the US dollar.  Gold price dropped on Wednesday, ahead of key political and economic events that are expected to stoke bullion's safe-haven appeal. Among the other precious metals: silver slightly decreased, the prices of platinum and palladium dropped off over 1%. All the key precious metals came under some pressure after the dollar gained points today.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2431.51 (+0.09%) and NASDAQ Index 6295.48 (+0.32%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21180.46 (+0.26%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes mixed today ahead of  “triple risk Thursday”, because of the Trio of important events: testimony on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election from former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, the U.K. general election, and a European Central Bank meeting. While stocks were trading close to their record highs this week, the risk is rising and the investors wait for tomorrow corrections. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are no high-impact data releases on the US calendar today, and tomorrow’s release of weekly jobless claims will likely to be in shadow due to the geopolitical events. UK and U.S. political uncertainty dominates sentiment.  </span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,284.80 (-0.28%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.73 (+0.33%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $950.50 (-0.03%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $856.80 (+2.48%), Dow Jones index 21,172.33 (0.01% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
U.S. Dollar Index futures are trading slightly better on “triple risk Thursday”. The US markets have been waiting for this day when three major risk events dominate investors’ attention.The European Central Bank will announce its rate decision offering guidance about the euro zone economic outlook going forward and former FBI Director James Comey will give a testimony to the U.S. Senate regarding his discussions with President Trump on dropping the investigation into the ex-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s alleged connections with Russia.

Gold price is little decreased this morning, while the silver and palladium prices are up, platinum also lost a few points.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2431.32 (-0.08%) and NASDAQ Index 6297.38 (+0.32%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21172.33 (-0.01%).</span>

Wall Street indexes were mixed on Thursday morning weighed down by the key events today. James Comey’s testimony could present a tremendous political risk to the market if he does release indeed some kind of a bombshell about the Trump presidency.Investors were worried that any further revelation about a probe into Russian interference with U.S. presidential election could dampen momentum for Trump's agenda of lower taxes. Meanwhile, investors also keep a close watch on European Central Bank's meeting in Estonia. European Central Bank announcements will show the euro's movement, that could affect U.S. Dollar changes.

UK election also takes place on Thursday. On UK election, the worst possible scenario to happen is Labor party secured the election. The Labor party victory means implementation of Corbyn’s tax-and-spend plans which will hurt UK corporate and create a rollercoaster on the global market.

		<title>Daily Market Review - June, 9</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,267.60 (-1.07%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.31 (-1.03%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $944.00 (+0.02%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $870.70 (+0.98%), Dow Jones index 21,182.53 (0.04% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Dollar got a good boost early in the Friday session from shocking British election result that left no single party with a clear claim to power. The dollar is on course for its best day in over a month, while euro and sterling headed toward their first weekly fall since April. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The testimony of former U.S. FBI Director James Comey before the Senate Intelligence Committee also supported U.S. Dollar. James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director testified that President Trump and others in his administration lied when they said agents had lost confidence in Mr. Comey. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold lost ground with the raising  Dollar Index after the European Central Bank cut its forecast for inflation and said that policymakers had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying program. Among the other precious metals: silver price slightly decreased, platinum and palladium prices are up today.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2433.79 (+0.03%) and NASDAQ Index 6321.76 (+0.39%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21182.53(+0.04%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks rose on Friday, putting the main Wall Street indexes on a positive track as investors shook off a surprising U.K. election result and began to focus on the meeting next week of Federal Reserve.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday’s  British election ended in a hung parliament, meaning no party won the 326 seats needed to form a majority. International media reports announced Teresa May reached a deal with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party to help prop up the Conservative Party’s weaker position. This</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shock result throws British politics into chaos and could send Britain's negotiations to leave the European Union - start June 19.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Former FBI Director James Comey accused President Donald Trump on Thursday of firing him to try to undermine the agency's investigation of possible collusion by Trump's campaign with Russia's alleged efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s pretty much all news for this week. </span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,266.00 (-0.03%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.93 (-1.40%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $940.00 (+0.32%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $866.00 (+0.58%), Dow Jones index 21,219.61 (0.25% decrease).</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a new week ahead starting today with investors and traders eagerly anticipating the next Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting beginning on Tuesday. It’s expected that the Fed will hike the interest rate again but will also give a nod to the fact that inflation is weaker. However, its officials shall remain confident about the economy, giving reassurance that it’s still on track.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Dollar Index is weaker, easing back from a nine-day high hit at the end of the previous week. However, the greenback, just like the entire market, is awaiting the big focus of this week, the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, that will begin on Tuesday morning and end on Wednesday afternoon, during which the US interest rate is expected to slightly increase.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metals had a small bounce overnight as investors await the outcome of this June’s FOMC meeting. Gold and silver are relatively flat, after being slightly under pressure over last week, yet both of them are down with and 0.03% and, respectively, 1.40%. The lack of new bullish fundamental developments on the geopolitical front has limited the buying interest in these two favored safe-haven metals. On the other hand, both platinum and palladium prices are up today with 0.32% and 0.58%.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2,424.71(-0.29%) and NASDAQ Index 6,159.64 (-0.78%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21,219.61(-0.25%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">NASDAQ futures fell about 1 percent today as technology stocks resumed their downward movement from the previous session. The selective selling is a result of investors’ decision to put fresh funds to work in energy and financials. The rotation into these stock sectors started after the former FBI Director’s written testimony has been released last week, which pointed out that neither President Donald Trump was obstructing justice nor was he the target of the investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dow Jones and S&amp;P futures also fell on Monday, trading with 17 points and, respectively, 4 points lower as traders kept an eye on the latest European political elections. While the future of the U.K. government faced further uncertainty because of an inconclusive general election last week, President Emmanuel Macron's party showed signs of success in the parliamentary elections’ first round in France.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the main focus of the US Stock Market is on the upcoming meeting of the Federal Reserve which must announce on Wednesday whether it will raise its interest rates. Stock market volatility could pick up in the week ahead if the Fed will hike its target rate by a quarter point on Wednesday afternoon, as expected. The US central bank is not anticipating to sound too dovish, but it may also point out to a weaker inflation.</span>

		<title>Gold Fails at Technical Trendline</title>
		<content><![CDATA[The failed breakout and reversal back below the long-term declining trendline at $1,280 for gold this past week is a negative development for the entire precious metals complex. From a technical standpoint, it is exactly what we did not want to see as far as a market ready for a major advance.

Even so, we must quantify the nature of a false breakout. Those failed moves that happen at the end of multi-year or multi-decade advances (as we have recently seen in the US dollar) tend to be leading signals of long-term trend reversals. The <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold market</a> at $1,280 per ounce is nowhere near the all-time high from 2011 at $1,923. So inherently this failed advance cannot carry the same weight as a long-term top.

Still, the reversal could carry the consequence of a significant intermediate-term decline. By failing to sustain the advance above this same trendline once again, gold remains in a negative posture for the time being, until proven otherwise.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2116" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/a_gold-2011-2017-downtrend.png" alt="gold-2011-2017-downtrend" width="1099" height="823" />

&nbsp;

For the week as a sum, gold fell 0.9% or $12 to close at $1,266 as of the final trade in the electronic access market in New York on Friday afternoon.

Gold’s next initial support comes in at $1,230, which is the rising (dashed) trendline visible on the chart from the January low.
<h2><strong>Beware Early Celebrators</strong></h2>
We have been making the case over the last year that many technical-based traders would be waiting for this pending breakout signal to begin buying, as clear long-term trendlines are visible to many who follow such charts.

However, on Tuesday when we first saw the breakout attempt, we noted the necessity for the advance to <u>hold</u> the $1,280 level at least through this week’s Fed meeting on Wednesday. Also on Tuesday, we observed many premature celebrations throughout the investment world regarding gold’s breakout.

Long-term breakouts must have both conviction and sustaining power. From a contrarian standpoint, the lack of caution by so many investors, including mainstream media outlets such as Bloomberg and well-known commodity analysts, was a bearish setup for the sharp reversal seen the following day. Below are just a few samples:

<strong> </strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2117" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/b_gold-long-term-breakouts-yearly.png" alt="Long-term breakouts" width="942" height="791" />
<h2><strong>Gold’s Next Support</strong></h2>
The consolidation pattern continues to get tighter, and a big move is coming in one direction or the other. Gold could still find support above $1,230 and then stage a legitimate breakout in July or early August. But a failure at the $1,230 rising support would trigger a short-term topping formation, which would target $1,140 initially, and open the door to a retest of the 2015 bottom at $1,045.

We do not want to get too far ahead of ourselves at this juncture, except to say that gold remains in an inherently neutral consolidation following this false breakout. The bearish resolution would result in either a retest of the 2015 bottom at $1,045 or even a new low, while the bullish resolution would result in a significant leg higher across the entire <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com">precious metals</a> complex targeting $1,535 within 6-12 months. Fundamental drivers will be causing these moves, but we will be able to observe the signals on the charts before any attributable news is announced publicly.

It is not easy to stay involved at the beginning of a suspected bull market for a reason – whiplash is the term for the price action we are observing and the unease it causes investors.

Was the entirety of the gain in 2016 just a big false start, before <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> heads for a new low? We cannot know until the above pattern is resolved.

The bottom line is short-term risk has grown based on the this week’s failure. However, the book is not yet written.
<h2><strong>Fed Meeting On Tap</strong></h2>
This Wednesday is the Federal Reserve interest rate meeting, where the Fed is expected to raise rates for the fourth time since December 2015.

Expect lower volatility trading on Monday and Tuesday, with high volatility immediately after the meeting announcement at 2pm, especially if the markets are at all surprised by the Fed decision. For reference, the market is expecting a single rate hike, with language hinting of a further 0.25% hike to come either in July or September, so anything other than this outcome could cause a high-volatility reaction through the rest of the week.

Next week we will examine the Fed policy statement and the impact it has on the precious metals.

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,259.30 (-0.49%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.74 (-1.15%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $928.00 (-1.38%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $859.00 (-1.72%), Dow Jones index 21,235.67(0.17 % decrease)</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Dollar Index is slightly weaker while gold and silver see a fifth-straight decline this Tuesday as investors are anticipating the next interest rates hike which is typically negative for these precious metals. Both are down with and 0.49% and, respectively, 1.15%. Platinum and palladium prices also decreased with 1.38% and 1.72%.</span>  

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This Tuesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) begins the first of its two-day meeting, with its latest Producer Price Indices to be released today and the interest rate decision due out tomorrow. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise the interest rates with another quarter point, and it’s also expected that it shall disclose more details on how it plans to reduce the mountain of Treasury and mortgage securities it currently holds.</span>

<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks this Tuesday: S&amp;P 500 2,429.39(-0.10%) and NASDAQ Index 6,175.46 (-0.52%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21,235.67(-0.17%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As technology stocks looked to bounce back this Tuesday morning, NASDAQ, Dow Jones, and S&amp;P futures opened higher but are still facing a downwards movement throughout these early hours. The analysts say that the ugly sell-off in tech names, like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google, is not necessarily an indication that the broader market is about to crack, yet there could be a possible summer swoon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The continued uncertainty about how quickly Donald Trump’s administration will implement its proposed policies also has a major impact on traders’ decisions. However, the entire stock market is primed for an increased interest rate and more details about how the Fed will begin the long process of shrinking its balance sheet.</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - June, 14</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,276.30 (+0.81%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.18 (+2.20%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $942.00 (+2.17%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $864.00 (-0.46%), Dow Jones index 21,331.93(+0.02 % increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This Wednesday morning, the U.S. Dollar Index fell to its lowest since November 9, after the release of a weaker-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index and Retail Sales data. On the other hand, gold prices slightly spiked in early trading Wednesday, on the back of FOMC’s news on CPI while still wobbling ahead of the meeting’s conclusion. The weaker-than-expected retail sale report for May is also working in favor of the precious metals market bulls, moving silver and platinum prices up with 2.20% and 2.17%. Palladium price slightly decreased with 0.46%.</span>  

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This unexpected decline in CPI and retail sales suggests that inflation pressures are moderating, which could lead to further interest rate increase. By the end of its two-day meeting this Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to raise U.S. interest rates with a quarter point. If the Fed raises rates, it will be the second of three expected hikes this year. The precious metals market is also keen to see if the Federal Reserve will act further and reduce its big balance sheet of government securities.</span>

<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks this Wednesday: S&amp;P 500 2,437.61(-0.11%) and NASDAQ Index 6,222.66 (+0.04%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21,331.93(+0.02%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stock markets closed at new highs on Tuesday following a rebound in technology stocks. Yet, traders are still digesting the latest round of retail sales and inflation data, so NASDAQ, Dow Jones, and S&P futures show slightly movements on this Wednesday morning.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders will be looking ahead to the second day of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting, in which it is widely anticipated to raise interest rates and establish its plans for the U.S. balance sheet, both announced at 2 p.m. E.T. However, the recent slowdown in inflation became a red flag for the stock market, which doubts the Federal Reserve’s ability to hike the interest rates a second time before the end of the year.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,253.00 (-0.56%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.71 (-0.95%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $921.00 (-1.39%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $851.00 (0.00%), Dow Jones Index 21,374.56(+0.22 % increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the wake of the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting that saw another interest rate increase, the U.S. dollar index is solidly higher while gold and silver prices are lower with 0.56% and 0.95%, hitting a three-week low in early trading Thursday. Investors are also bearish for other precious metals today, as the platinum price is down with 1.39% while palladium showed no price movements.</span>  

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve announced that it will proceed with interest rate hikes despite the softish inflation data and laid out a plan to begin the fairly aggressive reduction of its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. It also maintained its interest rate forecast, predicting that there will be another hike for this year. The Fed Chair Janet Yellen sounded more hawkish on inflation, although the FOMC statement showed that US inflationary pressures have eased a bit recently. As a result, the marketplace deemed this latest FOMC meeting as more hawkish on US monetary policy.</span>

<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks this Thursday: S&amp;P 500 2,437.92(-0.10%) and NASDAQ Index 6,194.89 (-0.41%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21,374.56(+0.22%).
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stock markets opened lower this morning, as traders reacted to the Fed’s latest policy decision, while technology stocks, including Facebook, Apple, and Amazon, slumped for the 2nd time this week. Dow Jones rose with 0.22%, while S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ declined 0.10% and 0.41%, respectively.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As it was widely anticipated, the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by 0.25%, however, its weaker-than-expected inflation numbers prompted worry among traders and investors. On the other hand, tech stocks are going downwards and throw more uncertainty in the marketplace after the Washington Post reported that special counsel Robert Mueller is currently investigating whether President Donald Trump attempted to obstruct justice.</span>

&nbsp;

<b><i>Here is a new week ahead when </i></b><b><i>Investors might get a break from the staggering news cycle that has dominated in June. There's only a smattering economic data on the calendar, with the one big piece of market news likely to come from banks.</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar is steady against a basket of currencies on Monday after slipping on soft US economic data, with investors awaiting comments by a top Federal Reserve official for clues on whether recent strength can be sustained. The US index climbed to a two-week high late the previous week after the Fed raised interest rates and kept the door open for another hike in 2017. But its rally was weighed down a little by Friday's weaker-than-expected housing and consumer sentiment data.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold prices are down and hit a four-week low in early U.S. trading Monday. Among the other precious metals: spot silver price was headed for its biggest weekly decline in six weeks, platinum price decreased and palladium also lost points on Monday.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2445.46 (+0.51%) and NASDAQ Index 6214.48 (+0.99%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21462.91(+0.37%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The main US stock indexes rose on Monday morning, suggesting a positive start to the week, split market over the last several sessions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Fed raised rates last week, weaker economic data has cast doubts over the central bank's ability to pursue an aggressive monetary policy for the rest of the year. </span>

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fed speakers (</span><b>Monday-Tuesday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Existing Home Sales (</span><b>Wednesday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Jobless Claims (</span><b>Thursday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), New Home Sales (</span><b>Friday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span>]]></content>

		<title>Fed Rate Hike and Gold</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve increased short-term interest rates on Wednesday by 0.25%, the fourth rate hike of the current cycle which began in December 2015. Short-term rates now stand at 1.00% - 1.25%, which are still generally - low levels, yet now a full point higher than they were 18-months ago.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The key from the Fed meeting on Wednesday was not simply the interest rate decision, but the language given in the accompanying statement regarding a potential reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet: “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Committee currently expects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated. This program… would gradually reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings by decreasing reinvestment of principal payments from those securities.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall that an expansion of the balance sheet is a euphemism for printing money, which is inflation. Thus, a normalization would imply a reduction in the money supply and a reduction in inflation.</span>
<h3><b>Will the Fed Normalize?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are extremely skeptical that the Fed will engage in any meaningful reduction in its balance sheet, mostly due to the central bank’s horrible record in doing so at any point in the past. Below is the Fed’s balance sheet over the last 15 years. Indeed, it is rare that the bank stops printing money for more than a few quarters at a time, its balance sheet having grown by nearly 500% during this time: </span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2138 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FRED-1-1024x394.png" alt="All Federal Reserve Banks" width="840" height="323" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking forward, a survey of Fed board members is now pricing in either 0-1 additional rate hikes in 2017, followed by 3-4 hikes in 2018, followed by 2 further hikes in 2019, as shown in the graph below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2139 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FOMC-Member-Forecasts.png" alt="FED Member Forecasts" width="505" height="353" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">Gold price</a> fell sharply following the Fed meeting, giving up $20 on Wednesday afternoon, not so much because of the rate increase, but because of the language regarding balance sheet normalization.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether or not the Federal Reserve will actually reduce its balance sheet, the market believes that it will, and over the short run, this is seen as gold-negative.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the week in sum, gold ended lower by $15 or 1.2% to close at $1,254 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Viewed in isolation, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> remains in its neutral consolidation pattern. Short-term support should exist at $1,230 (rising dashed trendline), and the nature of any rebound that occurs at this level will tell us much about what to expect over the remainder of the year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The more critical 2015 – 2017 support (blue line) – which is rising every week – now comes in at $1,160.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2140 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2011-2017-Downtrend-1024x767.png" alt="2011-2017 Downtrend" width="557" height="417" />
<h3><b>Gold Has Formed Higher Lows on Successive Rate Hikes</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast to the theory often purported in the mainstream media that rising interest rates are negative for gold, the precious metal has formed a series of higher lows within one week of each of the Fed rate hike announcements, shown below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2141 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Gold.png" alt="Gold " width="1145" height="499" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Will last week’s announcement thus mark a fourth higher low forming in gold again? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Time will tell.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,246.40 (-0.21%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.53 (-0.48%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $930.40 (-0.18%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $868.85 (+0.35%), Dow Jones index 21,506.95 (0.10% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Dollar index is steady on Tuesday near 97. However, this support level is weak so investors should prepare for more downside activity. The US Dollar lost strength last week after the Fed’s two-day interest rate meeting. Weaker-than-expected economic data included retail sales, the consumer price index, and the producer price index also weighed down US Dollar. On the other hand, the yesterday speech from New York Fed President, William Dudley helped the US dollar to maintain its gains. The market is looking forward to New York Fed speeches this week. Gold price lost a few points on Tuesday, among the other precious metals silver and platinum prices are lower today, palladium price rose a little.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2445.41 (-0.34%) and NASDAQ Index 6223.30 (-0.25%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21506.95(-0.10%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The main U.S. stock market indexes pulled back slightly on Tuesday, pressured by falling energy shares following a sharp drop lower oil prices.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said that low-interest rates do pose financial stability concerns that central bankers and the private sector must take seriously. Rosengren’s remarks came after the Fed last week raised interest rates and outlined a plan for shrinking of its massive balance sheet. A speech by House Speaker Paul Ryan on tax reform later Tuesday is expected to be in the limelight as well.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week has a lightly economic data for this week; most investors focus their attention on Fed speeches.  </span>

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current account deficit, Eric Rosenberg speaks.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,244.80 (+0.04%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.49 (-0.18%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $926.00 (-0.55%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $885.20 (+0.68%), Dow Jones index 21,468.31 (0.01% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar is a little bit weaker on Wednesday than yesterday's closing. However, the greenback rose higher earlier this week following comments from New York Fed President who said the further improvement in the US labor market would kindle inflation, which has shown signs of flagging in recent months. Gold inched up on Wednesday after hitting its lowest in five weeks in the previous sessions, buoyed as equities fell and the US dollar eased from one-month highs following a tumble in crude oil prices. Also, the possibility of another interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve this year is underpinning the bearish outlook for the yellow metal. Among the other precious metals: silver lost a few points, platinum slightly slipped today, while palladium is up.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2438.65 (+0.07%) and NASDAQ Index 6206.01 (+0.31%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21468.31(+0.01%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks started mixed on Wednesday as investors focused on volatile oil prices, which stabilized after dropping to lowest levels in more than seven months. Crude prices tumbled more than 2 percent, sending energy stocks lower on Tuesday on signs of rising oil production. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors also keep an eye on Washington as they digested remarks from House Speaker Paul Ryan on tax reform. He said the government is cutting back on regulatory red tape and that changes to the tax code must be permanent.</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - June, 22</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,254.00 (+0.15%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.65 (+0.84%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $938.60 (+0.16%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $892.40 (+0.39%), Dow Jones index 21,411.28 (0.01% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar slipped against the bucket of major currencies on Thursday. After two speeches from Fed officials, the US Dollar to Euro exchange rate has remained close. The first-time filings for U.S. unemployment benefits rose slightly last week, supporting the view that the labor market would tighten further. Gold prices rose on Thursday, supported by the weaker dollar and weakness in US Treasury yields. Among other precious metals, silver gained about 1 per cent. Platinum touched its highest in a week during the session, palladium also slightly rose today.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2435.46 (+0.03%) and NASDAQ Index 6239.06 (+0.09%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21411.28(+0.01%).</span>

U.S. stock market indexes opened slightly changed on Thursday, as oil prices remained near multi-month lows, undermining efforts by major producers to stabilize the market.  Oil prices rose on Thursday, but investors worry over whether OPEC-led output cuts would be able to rein in a three-year glut continued to keep prices around 10-month lows.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
U.S. Dollar Index futures are trading lower on Friday. While the news would usually be good for US oil exporters, the price of crude has instead dropped even lower than earlier this week.The dollar is under pressure from falling U.S. Treasury yields and worries that weak inflation will keep the Fed from raising rates later in the year. Gold prices edged higher on Friday as the dollar softened and risk aversion due to geopolitical events buoyed the safe-haven appeal of the metal. The Fed has mentioned it will most likely raise rates one more time.  Among other precious metals: silver gained about one percent, platinum and palladium lost a few points.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US. stocks on Friday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2433.80 (-0.02%) and NASDAQ Index 6228.80 (-0.14%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21368.56(-0.13%).</span>

This week economic data was pretty light. Investors will keep an eye on key US economic data due next week. US data due next week include the June consumer confidence indicator, pending home sales, crude oil inventories, revised first-quarter GDP and the PCE price index. Oil is not in short supply with U.S. producers drilling and pumping as soon as oil prices rise over $50.

<b><i>After last week that produced zero “high” rated events, this coming week will see a lot of economic data for investors. </i></b><b><i>Fed speakers comments will also be an important focus this week</i></b><b><i>. </i></b><b><i>Overall, improved data can remedy the source of weakness for the US Dollar now: markets don’t believe the Fed’s prescribed path for raising rates and normalizing policy. </i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After being weaker last week, the US Dollar Index started Monday on a stable note. The US Dollar Index lost strength last week because of a weak support from US economic data and increased concerns about the another one interest rate hike by the Fed. This week the market focused core durable goods orders, CB Consumer Confidence, pending home sales, and US GDP scheduled to release. Gold price fell today about 1 per cent the lowest point since May. No-one has a clue what happened; some investors suggest this drop was a result of an erroneous order. Among the other precious metals: silver price slightly decreased, platinum and palladium prices are also lower on Monday.   </span>
<h2><b>Stock Market Today</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2441.50 (+0.13%) and NASDAQ Index 6259.15 (-0.11%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21394.76 (-0.01%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an important scheduled economic data this week. Meanwhile, geopolitical concerns will continue to be a factor in US market.The market analytics consider the market could be weighted down because of the trouble in a  lot of places like North Korea, Syria, even the European Union or the United Kingdom. This week investors will be also focused on financials after the Italian government agreed to spend billion to wind up two of the Italy's banks. In politics, the U.S. President Donald Trump will meet the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi at the White House on Monday, for discussing the ideas about fighting terrorism and promoting economic growth.</span>

<b>Economic data for this week: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durable Goods orders,Chicago Fed national activity Index (</span><b>Monday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), June Consumer Confidence, Fed Chair Janet Yellen in London on global economic issues (</span><b>Tuesday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), May Advance Trade in Goods (</span><b>Wednesday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Final GDP revision (</span><b>Thursday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, May Personal Consumption Expenditure Core, Personal income (</span><b>Friday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span>]]></content>

		<title>Gold vs. Commodities</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have seen weakness in the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold price</a> over the past two weeks, and if gold fails to break higher from its ongoing consolidation over the next 3-6 months, a significant culprit will selling amongst broad-based commodity funds. Below we zoom in on a detail of the CRB Commodity Index, which gold measures an average price level of 19 commodities including <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/coins">silver</a>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum/coins">platinum</a>, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium/coins">palladium</a>, the industrial metals, the energy complex, and agricultural products.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that the CRB index has recently broken below its 15-month support zone between 176 – 179, which had held since April 2016.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2174 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CRB-1024x767.png" alt="CRB Commodity" width="840" height="629" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our technical target for the CRB over the short run is 158 on the index – in other words, a retest of the 2016 lows. This target is calculated by subtracting the amplitude of the failed advance above the support zone (19) from the breakdown point (177). Fundamentally, it represents an equal number of long contract holders who are likely to liquidate below the breakdown point as who bought above the support zone over the past year.</span>
<h3><b>Gold Sometimes Grouped with Other Commodities</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although gold is certainly not simply another commodity like the rest of the CRB index, during times in which investor psychology is preoccupied with “hot” markets such as technology stocks (Amazon, Facebook, etc.), real estate, and crypto-currencies, sentiment tends to fade against all commodities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We might disagree with the market fundamentally, i.e. we know currency debasement and unsustainable debt continues to increase every day, but a key point of our philosophy is to put our own fundamental opinion second, and to respect the market first.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At present, the market is seeing less of a need for safety due to a focus on hot risky asset classes, and so that component of gold demand is absent. We are thus witnessing gold and silver have a high correlation with the rest of the commodity complex. In such an environment, when institutional funds place sells orders for their diversified commodity holdings, gold is dumped in tandem with the group.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, gold has been outpacing the rest of the commodity complex since the late 2015 lows. However, such relative strength is not always sufficient to stop precious metals from falling in a general commodity liquidation over the short run. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If we see gold break down below $1,230, a key short-term support level, a continued decline in the CRB index will be a major contributing factor.</span>
<h3><b>Commodity Index Long-Term</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we back out the chart for the CRB index from 1974 – 2017:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2175 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CRB-Commodity.png" alt="CRB Commodity" width="1019" height="763" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be noted that </span><b>broad <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/02/06/gold-silver-commodities/">commodities</a> are now the cheapest they have been in 43 years nominally</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and by far the cheapest in real terms (adjusted for inflation). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The low of 2016 is in the process of being retested, which is what may lead to near-term weakness in gold – but in viewing the chart above we must seriously ask the question: how much lower can commodities fall from 43-year lows?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are tangible materials of finite supply in the earth’s crust, which the ever-growing world population consumes every day – a reality that will not change in our lifetimes unless technology to harvest minerals from asteroids arrives soon, a scenario still the realm of science fiction works.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The CRB Commodity Index cannot go to zero as a currency or individual stock can, yet this is the lowest that commodities have been in four decades. <b>When things that cannot go to zero are priced at their lowest in over a generation, we must view the relative risk/reward proposition as favorable from a long-term perspective.</b> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our assessment is that even if moderate weakness continues for several months to 1-2 years, broad commodities are much closer to a long-term bottom than a top. <img class="alignright wp-image-2176 size-medium" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Cycle-300x155.png" alt="The relative risk" width="300" height="155" /></span>

<b>Commodity Cycles</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Commodities are cyclical in nature. The chart at right shows the three major cycles that the commodity complex has seen since the 1970’s, divided into two sub-phases each of boom and bust cycles (green and red shading, respectively). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Booms and busts are an inherent feature of the typical 10-20 year delay that it takes for the mining lifecycle to move from:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a) mineral discovery through </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(b) mine permitting to </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(c) construction to </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(d) successful production which then</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(e) increases supply in the market. </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is said that in commodities “low prices are the solution for low prices”, as marginal mine supply is eliminated when prices fall, eventually forcing prices higher again. We are seeing this phenomenon already in many junior oil and precious metals companies: deposits which were once economic are no longer at today’s low commodity prices, and thus the mines are placed on care and maintenance, reducing supply until higher prices emerge.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Commodities in Relation to Gold</b></h3>
Even if weakness continues in the commodity complex through the remainder of this year, our assessment is that most commodities are much closer to long-term bottoms than long-term tops. Of course, each commodity will move at different times and with a different set of fundamentals. Yet the macro analysis shows a world preoccupied at the moment with the bull markets in digital technology – but as day must follow night, higher commodity prices must follow a period of lower prices. Gold selling due to broad commodity weakness is thus limited in the big picture, even if weakness over the short run cannot be ruled out.

		<title>Daily Market Review - June, 27</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,250.60 (+0.57%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.72 (+0.41%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $925.60 (+0.21%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $871.00 (-0.89%), Dow Jones index 21,411.56 (0.01% increase). </i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar is falling against the bucket of main currencies on Tuesday. The US dollar index has lost 6.3% in recent months. The continued decline in long-term perspective has come despite a 1% bounce in the US dollar index in the past weeks. Gold rose on Tuesday after hitting a six-week low in the previous session. A huge sell order of total 1.85 million ounces pushed gold to a six-week low on Monday, although the markets stayed pretty silent about this drop. Analytics consider there is a risk that the Fed delivers more interest rates rises than expected, and it will create a positive boost for the Dollar, which may weigh down gold. Among other precious metals: silver rose 0.6 %, platinum price climbed today, palladium price lost a few points. </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened slightly lower S&amp;P 500 2437.15 (-0.08%) and NASDAQ Index 6226.38 (-0.33%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21411.56(+0.01%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street started Tuesday mixed as yesterday economic data battled pressure and housing markets received a weak reading on home price growth. Some of the international most influential bankers will speak on Tuesday. Also, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to appear at a conference in London at 1 p.m. ET. The Bank of England will announce its Financial Stability Report, providing insight into its views on the current economic situation in the U.K., which is also important for US markets. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Weaker-than-expected durable-goods orders released yesterday may also limit gains for the markets. Durable-goods orders slipped 1.1% in May following a similar drop in April, disappointing investors who expected a smaller decline.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar is weaker in morning trades on Wednesday. The US Dollar slipped down this week after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen made her first public remarks yesterday since the US central bank raised rates on June 14. While there was no clear indication from the Yellen’s comments that plans for tightening monetary policy had accelerated or decelerated, she did feel it necessary to mention that US asset valuations are somewhat ‘rich’ by traditional metrics. Gold prices climbed today, rising for the second straight session at the bullion market today. As always weakness trend in the dollar raised demand for the precious metals as a safe-haven. Among other precious metals: silver also increased today, platinum price climbed today, palladium price lost a few points.  </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2431.84 (+0.51%) and NASDAQ Index 6168.48 (+0.38%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21426.81(+0.55%). </span>

U.S. stock futures traded higher on Wednesday after the European Central Bank tried to walk back comments made by its president. In economic news, consumer confidence data for June topped investors' expectations. Investors keep an eye on a report on U.S. international trade in goods for May, which will be released today.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar dropped to its lows for the year today as the comments from major central banks signaled the era of easy money might be coming to an end. Support for the dollar disappeared as investors realized the US Federal Reserve might not be the only game in town when it came to higher interest rates. Gold lost some points today even </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">US dollar weakened against other currencies on bets that central banks in Europe were preparing to scale back monetary stimulus, but the bullion's gains were capped by a surge in equities.

<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,243.50 (-0.99%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.67 (-0.23%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $931.10 (+0.56%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $848.45 (-0.48%), Dow Jones index 21,389.47 (0.48% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
US Dollar is slightly higher against the bucket of the major currencies on Friday. Yesterday the US Dollar Index was holding below 95.40, headed toward the lowest close since late September. Gold price Gold and silver prices slipped this week in the international as well as US markets. Gold prices are higher today. Rising interest rate scenarios, weak investment demand, and optimism about the US economic growth and hints from leading central bank have been causing troubles for gold prices. Although dollar index is standing at nine-month lows, it is not offering any support for precious metals. Among the other precious metals: silver slightly dropped, palladium also lost a few points, platinum price increased.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2428.82 (+0.38%) and NASDAQ Index 6162.95 (+0.28%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21389.47(+0.48%). </span>

Wall Street Indexes were higher in early trading on Friday, considering that US markets could close out the week with not mixed results. Friday marks the final trading session of the 1st part of 2017, a period marked by strong stock market returns and low volatility. Taking a look at the second part of 2017, investors believe it unlikely that low volatility will persist indefinitely. Investors also keep an eye on more data releases, such as personal income rising more than the expected gains. Consumer sentiment is slated to come out today. No significant earnings or bond auctions are scheduled.

		<title>Gold – A Large Move is Approaching</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">On a semi-regular basis, we find it helpful to revisit the longer-term perspective for the precious metals, so that short-term price action does not dominate our focus. This will be important shortly as, despite what may seem like a volatile market over the past few months, </span><b>we have reason to believe that the volatility in the gold market is set to increase massively throughout the second half of 2017 and into 2018</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> is in the process of forming a long-term bottom, but the challenge is that long-term bottoms often feature prices which can see a series of retests and/or nominal new lows throughout a multi-year basing period. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 20-year <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold chart</a> below, we see a confluence of four major technical support levels between the $850/ounce and $1,045/ounce levels. Whenever there is a confluence of technical targets within a certain price band, it represents a high-confidence level for a major low to form. While the following zone is too wide for short-term traders, it should give a reliable long-term support target for investors with a multi-year time horizon.</span>

<strong> The levels are labeled below:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2008 – 2015 horizontal support at $1,045.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term rising linear trendline which started in 2001, now at $900.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the entire 2000 – 2011 advance, which comes at $890.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former 1980 all-time closing high, which comes at $850.</span></li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2200 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Gold-2008-2015-P1.png" alt="Gold 2008-2015 P1" width="1125" height="495" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains possible that the absolute low for gold was formed in December 2015 at $1,045, but the likelihood of a retest of that level and/or nominal new lows is still significant. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A break of gold’s long-term declining 2011 – 2017 downtrend would give us increased confidence that the absolute low has already been formed, but this key <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/04/17/gold-breakout-approaching/">technical breakout</a> has remained elusive despite multiple attempts over the previous year.</span>
<h3><b>Gold Short-Term</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Zooming into the 18-month view, gold is extremely “tight” on the short-term chart, caught between its falling long-term downtrend (magenta) and its short-term rising trend from January (dashed teal color). These two trends are converging within the next six weeks, and when this happens one must necessarily break. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The immediate area of concern is highlighted below in green:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2201 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Gold-2011-2017-Downtrend-P2-1024x767.png" alt="Gold 2011-2017 Downtrend P2" width="840" height="629" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A break lower from this short-term green triangle opens up an initial decline to the $1,160 level in Q3, corresponding with the rising blue trend forming the lower boundary of the pennant-shaped consolidation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a break higher would be an important signal of a market set to start a new multi-year advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We truly are approaching a crossroads for the precious metal on the short-term chart.</span>

<b>Volatility Confirms Significant Move Ahead</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That a large price move is coming for gold can also be seen by examining volatility. Below is an index which trades on the Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE), which tracks the daily volatility of gold futures contracts. The index is shown since 2010:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2202 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GVZ-Gold-Volatility-P3.png" alt="GVZ Gold Volatility P3" width="878" height="437" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we can see, gold volatility is now at 8-year lows. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility is inherently a neutral market expression – in other words when volatility is low, it only tells us that a period of higher volatility is set to follow. However, it does not tell us in which direction the strong movement will occur.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The CBOE volatility index is confirming that either a surge or a significant decline is to come in gold, depending on which direction the consolidation breaks.</span>
<h3><b>How Would This Look on the Long-Term Chart?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term chart on page 1 is now stripped of its annotations so that we can envision how either a breakout higher or lower – as predicted by both our technical analysis and the record low volatility of present –  would manifest in the market:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2203 size-large" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Confluence-of-Support-Levels-Bottom-Zone-1024x451.png" alt="Confluence of Support Levels -Bottom Zone" width="840" height="370" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical analysis is about identifying high probability scenarios based on observable trends in the marketplace. It is no crystal ball, but it does help establish reasonable expectations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again: the breakout either higher or lower must begin by Q3 – Q4. This is based on the convergence of the pennant consolidation visible in the 18-month gold chart.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout higher should see an initial advance to target 2016 highs near $1,375 per ounce, followed by a modest retracement, en route to the $1,535 in 2018.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a break lower should see a rapid plunge to retest 2015 lows at $1,045, followed by a modest recovery, which would then open up the possibility of new lows within the green support band below $1,000.</span>
<h3><b>Worst Case Scenario</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We maintain that even the worst-case scenario of a drop below $1,000 will represent part of a larger multi-year bottoming process – and so: </span><b>how one should consider preparing is largely dependent on one’s individual time the horizon and risk tolerance.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those with shorter-term time horizons should be cautioned that if new lows formed, it could take gold several more years of basing to regain its upward trajectory. Yet accumulation throughout any final plunge would be a healthy plan for those looking to accumulate holdings as part of a long-term strategy.</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - July, 06</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,225.20 (+0.03%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.07 (+0.18%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $914.00 (+0.33%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $842.75 (-0.15%), Dow Jones index 21,403.07 (0.35% decrease)</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After pulling back last week, the US Dollar Index is on a stable note this week. US dollar slightly fell on Thursday after a round of weaker than expected market data, giving space for raising interest rates by the Federal Reserve. The greenback was already on the slipping way after Wednesday's issue of the Fed's policy minutes failed to provide a clear picture of future interest rate increases. Gold price is pretty steady on Thursday, as Federal Reserve at least released a few comments how about future interest rates and how inflation might affect the rate hikes. Investors concern that higher interest rates tend to boost the dollar and weigh down the gold price. Among other precious metals: silver is slightly increased, platinum price is up, and palladium price is still lower this week. In general, it seems that all the main metals are having troubles moving higher, and geopolitical tensions with North Korea just add issues to this situation.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2422.28 (-0.42%) and NASDAQ Index 6123.25 (-0.45%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21403.07(-0.35%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading lower today because of the combination of geopolitical tension and some signs that global central banks are running closer to the idea that rising bond yields are hurting investor sentiment. Investors are also becoming risk-averse due to rising concerns about the North Korea’s test launch this week. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, President Donald Trump took time during his speech in Poland, on Thursday to comment on the economic situation in the US and the recent situation for the stock market.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,216.10 (-0.68%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $15.80 (-2.25%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $908.70 (-0.76%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $834.85 (-0.86%), Dow Jones index 21,364.85 (0.21% increase)</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar Index is on a positive note this week and stable in the early hours today after Thursday showed a rise in non-manufacturing sector activity in June. That was an especially supportive result for the US Index. Gold price fell on Friday, and it was its biggest weekly loss in two months. Gold has been weighed down by overall bearish sentiment toward the sector. A stronger-than-expected NFP report could increase the odds of another Fed rate hike later in the year so this news is likely to be bearish for gold prices. Among the other precious metals: silver lost over 2 percent, Platinum price is down, palladium dropped in Friday trading and this is its lowest level since June 2.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2416.59 (+0.28%) and NASDAQ Index 6126.25 (+0.60%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21364.85 (+0.21%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today after the Labor Department released the June hiring and unemployment figures on Friday morning showed the U.S. added 222,000 jobs in June and this is the second largest gain this year. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the latest official data of the state of the American economy, covered the unemployment rate and non-farm payrolls results. The government employment report also added more support for the Federal Reserve to continue its plan to normalize monetary policy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors wait for a two-day meeting of G20 leaders that starts on Friday in Hamburg. Along with President Trump, others attending include Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,210.40 (-0.68%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $15.34 (-2.25%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $899.75 (-0.76%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $838.45 (-0.86%), Dow Jones index 21,428.67 (0.09% increase)</i></b>

&nbsp;

<b><i>Here is a new week ahead, which will bring a lot of economic data on inflation, sales and production, the aftermath of the G20 meeting and geopolitical developments, also Fed chair Yellen’s Humphrey Hawkins testimony. The important data release on the calendar this week could help clarify the near-term perspectives for the Fed and the markets.     </i></b><b><i>
</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
US Dollar Index is trading slightly higher on Monday, being supported by bigger than expected increase in U.S. jobs release. The report suggests the US economy is strong enough for the Fed to continue with its increasing rates plan. Even, the Fed has signaled last week willingness to raise interest rates even with the economy holding back. The  US Dollar was also supported by higher U.S. Treasury yields. Gold price was steady early Monday and then slightly decreased. Last week gold fell more than 2 percent and reached the lowest level since March.  Among other precious metals: Silver was trading lower on Monday, platinum and palladium prices also lost points.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2428.81 (+0.15%) and NASDAQ Index 6167.38 (+0.23%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21428.67 (0.09%).</span>

Wall Street started a new week on a positive note with the higher indexes. The first aftermath after G20 meeting gave increasing hope about the strength of the world economy. By many means, the June jobs report was a pretty good one. The US economy added 220,000 new jobs. Both the employment rate and the labor force participation rate higher.

President Trump's participation in G20 and visit to Poland haven’t caused any significant changes in the global market. The major issue on the summit was that the US left the climate change agreement and Trump’s meeting with Russian President-Vladimir Putin.

<strong>The economic data this week:</strong> Consumer credit <strong>(Monday)</strong>, Job openings, Wholesale inventories <strong>(Tuesday)</strong>, Janet Yellen testimony <strong>(Wednesday)</strong>, Weekly jobless claims, along with the June Federal budget <strong>(Thursday)</strong>, Consumer Price Index, Retail Sales, Industrial Production <strong>(Friday)</strong>.

		<title>Silver’s Flash Crash</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver</a> saw a “flash crash” on Thursday night EST / Friday morning in Asia, falling momentarily by at least $1.50 before recovering somewhat during the day.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The actual low print is up to some debate, depending on which exchange and contract one refer to the low bid for the spot market (shown below) according to our trading desk was $14.16, while some other platforms are showing the low as $14.50.<img class="alignright wp-image-2229 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Flash-crash.png" alt="Silver &quot;Flash, crash&quot;" width="579" height="448" /> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will be conservative and call the low $14.16. Either way, clearly the exchanges were overwhelmed with whoever decided to sell such a quantity of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> in such a short period.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many futures traders were stopped out at significant losses during the "flash crash". However, as discussed in recent articles, we have been monitoring negative leading signals in both the CRB commodity index and the gold/silver ratio for the past month, and so we were largely expecting the recent drops in metals prices.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Several analysts are calling this "flash crash" the final bottom for silver’s recent decline: they are likely premature in these calls. It is important to understand what happens during a "flash crash": someone dumps a huge amount of paper silver on the market at a single instant. Stops are taken out, and selling begets further selling as traders panic to avoid losses. The selling only stops when a significantly large entity – who is using lower leverage and thus does not run the risk of being stopped out by the waterfall decline – steps in with a sufficiently-large bid to absorb all the panic selling.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is: we now know where large entities are willing to buy silver. That figure is down near $14.16 or slightly above.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bad news is: that level is likely to be retested at least once, if not on multiple occasions over the next 3-6 months. In a worst-case scenario, the large bidder will be exhausted (though he will have absorbed most of the sellers), and a final low will occur marginally below the bidder’s established price ($14.16 at the lower range).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, we have here, in this flash crash, a strong piece of evidence to suggest that the low for silver’s current decline will occur in the low-to-mid $14 range. We will, of course, use other forms of technical analysis to zero in on this low as it approaches.</span>
<h3><b>On Manipulation</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a final note on silver: yes, we would consider this type of selling to be “manipulation” of the markets, by some entity. However, our goal is to be pragmatic: such manipulation is going to occur periodically in silver, so let us at least protect ourselves and possibly profit from these occasions, as opposed to standing by as mere victims as many commentators seem content to do in the precious metals world. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the long run, silver will eventually be moving higher.</span>
<h3><b>Silver Intermediate Outlook</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning to the silver chart itself, for the week gold’s cousin fell $1.20 or 7.2%, to close at $15.43 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.  The technical damage is reflected on the near-term chart and outlook:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2230 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Primary-resistance.png" alt="Silver technical damage" width="586" height="529" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our view is that, in percentage terms, the majority of silver’s decline is already behind us. A final drop to the low $14’s or mid $13’s would not constitute a significant further percentage drop – but it would sufficiently harm investor sentiment such that a functional retest of 2015 lows could mark the most important buying opportunity for the remainder of the decade.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The advance that occurs following a double-bottom scenario of the $13 - $14 region (equivalent to the 2015 lows) should be just as strong as the surge that began in first-half 2016… so let us remain prepared.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,213.10 (-0.18%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $15.72 (-0.25%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $899.30 (-0.91%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $846.70 (+0.02%), Dow Jones index 21,409.50 (0.98% increase)</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
US Dollar Index is trading higher, supported by the economic reports and a weaker Euro and Japanese Yen. The investor's actions are slow this week ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s remarks before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. Analytics and traders hope Yellen’s testimony gives the clues about the timing of the next Fed interest rate hike. The major predictions suggest next rate hike could be in December. Gold price started Tuesday lower on the stronger US Dollar. Bullion prices are also looking ahead to Yellen's testimony. Precious metals are incredibly sensitive to rising rates because they push up bond yields, increasing the opportunity cost of holding non-interest-bearing gold. Among other precious metals: silver price slowly decreased today,  platinum price lost about 1 percent, palladium price is slightly increased.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2424.76 (-0.11%) and NASDAQ Index 6179.70 (+0.07%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21409.50 (+0.98%). </span>

Wall Street Indexes are trading mixed today with little changes less than 1 percent. The overall market trend is lower this week because investors keep their attention on upcoming economic data later this week. After the strong jobs report on Friday last week another release of U.S. Job openings will be released today at 10 a.m.

On the geopolitical field after G20 meeting aftermath last week market analysts and economists believe that the geopolitical risk will continue to weigh down global markets. Rising tensions between countries ever since President Trump came to power keep traders and investors on their next course of actions.

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Job openings,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Wholesale inventories</span>]]></content>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index seems to be ready to rebound on Wednesday after the regular session opening. The market is reversing earlier weakness ahead of the first day of Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s first day of testimony before the Congress. Based on the current price and the earlier price actions the direction of the index is likely to turn from weaker position to the higher level in the short-term perspective. Gold price held steady on Wednesday as investors are awaiting testimony from US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and central bank officials expressed caution about further interests rate hikes. Any pause in US interest rate would be highly beneficial for gold price and help it to recover. Among other precious metals: silver rose about 0.75 %, platinum and palladium prices gained over 1% in an early trading session.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2439.00 (+0.55%) and NASDAQ Index 6243.03 (+0.84%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21500.97 (+0.43%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street main indexes advanced on Wednesday, after the release of prepared congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen who said earlier that the interest rate increases will be gradual and would not need to rise much further.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest political news about the emails between Donald Trump Jr that were framed as part of the Russian government's support for Donald Trump added some tension in stock markets, offering warnings that investors should be aware of all upcoming changes.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
US Dollar looks steady on early morning trading, following Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s speech. Janet Yellen started her two-day testimony to Congress yesterday with a more dovish take on a monetary policy that sent the greenback on the lower level. Yellen said on Wednesday that the U.S. economy was healthy enough for further rate hikes. Gold price slightly dropped on Thursday, while a weaker dollar could be supportive for gold over the short term, the continued strength in US equities remain a drag. Meanwhile, gold prices have seen only a mild recovery following Yellen's testimony on Wednesday; there has not been any convincing reversal as such, only a slight pullback. Among other precious metals: silver price is lower, platinum and palladium prices lost over 1 percent.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
&nbsp;

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals  </b></h3>
U.S. Dollar Index is trading lower today shortly before the release of reports on U.S. Consumer Inflation and June Retail Sales. Generally speaking, US Dollar was on the better level this week after Fed Chair Janet Yellen showed deeper concerns over the persistently weak inflation during her testimony before the Senate Banking Committee earlier this week. Gold price jumped higher exactly after the results of Yellen’s speech because investors don’t want the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates anytime soon. Among other precious metals: silver price rose this morning, platinum and palladium prices are also up.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened mixed S&amp;P 500 2447.45 (-0.02%) and NASDAQ Index 6286.79 (+0.21%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21536.48 (-0.08%).</span>

Wall Street Indexes were mixed today ahead of the first set of earnings from the big Wall Street banks.

The Consumer Price Index and retail sales report for June will be released today. Data on industrial production for June also will be released.

Geopolitical tension keeps weighing down the global markets. After North Korea successfully launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4, US Administration may enforce new sanctions on small Chinese banks and firms for their connections to North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,236.50 (+0.28%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.23 (+0.49%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $935.40 (+0.55%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $864.35 (+0.49%), Dow Jones index 21,629.88 (0.04% decrease)</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a new week ahead which will bring us the major economic events: meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, profit reports from JPMorgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo. In the U.S. economic news investors are also waiting for more highlights coming out of Washington on the Russian investigation. Across the globe, investors and analytics will be watching the news from the European Central Bank will have to say about interest rates.    </span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals  </b></h3>
US Dollar Index was steady in early morning trading, based on the current price the direction of US Dollar Index is likely to be in a positive direction.The dollar index has also been influenced by the movement in the Euro. Gold price is also trading higher today in the early session on Monday. However, the futures market showed no dynamic following the disappointing U.S. economic data on Friday. Gold traders should focus on the direction of U.S. Treasury yields and not so much on the direction of U.S.Dollar.  Among other precious metals: silver price slightly rose, platinum and palladium prices are also higher today.
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened mixed S&amp;P 500 2458.60 (-0.03%) and NASDAQ Index 6315.45 (+0.05%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21629.88 (-0.04%).</span>

Wall Street indexes were little changed on Monday; investors are looking ahead to key quarterly results which will be released later this week. Corporate quarterly results could help to shed light on whether current levels are justified by economic activity at American corporations. While investors are concentrated on earning reports, economic analytics suggest tax legislation remains the most important issue for  US  stocks.

The criticism about a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Kremlin-linked lawyer in June 2016 also adds tension in US stocks market.

		<title>Gold Technical Update</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week we noted that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver </a>had broken its year-long support zone between $15.75 - $16.15 during the prior week’s <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/10/silvers-flash-crash/">flash crash</a>. What does this apparent breakdown mean for gold? Let us update the technical perspective for gold for the short and intermediate timeframes:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2258" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Gold-for-the-short-and-intermediate-timeframes.png" alt="Gold for the short and intermediate time frames" width="1058" height="792" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the week as a sum, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> rose 1.5% or $18 to close at $1,227 as of the final trade in New York on Friday afternoon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks ago, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> broke short-term rising support at $1,232 (turquoise line, above). This trendline was rising, and we must recall that retests of rising trendlines can indeed occur at a different (in this case higher) price level than the original breakdown point.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, our best assessment is that gold is set to move moderately higher for the remainder of July and into August below its broken short-term support. This means that gold should continue moderately higher for the next 4-6 weeks below $1,250. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect gold will not regain its broken (turquoise color) trendline yet, and so the precious metal should then begin to turn lower again by late August, toward a test of its lower (blue) boundary of the pennant consolidation. This level now comes in at $1,175 and is rising by the day.</span>
<h3><b>On a Gold Recapture of Broken Trendline</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If gold were to negate its recent breakdown and recapture $1,250, the convergence of this short-term (turquoise) trend and the long-term (magenta color) 2011-2017 downtrend would occur at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly the same price level</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by late-August: $1,250. So, it would be one of the clearest technical signals we could ask for to indicate a new strong rising trend had begun, as both a breakout from a short-term and long-term resistance level simultaneously. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Officially, there are 5.5 months left before the giant pennant-shaped consolidation shown above must resolve in one direction or another. This would be quite literally at the end of the calendar year in December, visible at the far right of the chart above. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the vast majority of historic examples, these patterns will resolve several months before the actual apex occurs. The August – October timeframe is our best estimation, as for confirmation to whether we will have a legitimate bull market on our hands or the beginning of a decline to new lows perhaps below the 2015 bottoms. There will be opportunities to profit and/or protect ourselves in either scenario, but we must get the primary direction correct first. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, short-term traders are cautioned that </span><b>whiplash is likely</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as gold is officially “trendless” – having broken both its short-term downtrend since June and its intermediate rising trend from January lows – all within the confines of the much larger consolidation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect volatility to begin lessening and for gold to appear almost comatose during the last several weeks immediately prior to either a breakdown or breakout in the August – October timeframe.</span>
<h3><b>Investment Considerations</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">How one chooses to position prior to the resolution of gold’s giant consolidation pattern is largely a factor of personal goals, time horizons, and risk tolerance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, an investor on a long-term accumulation plan, who is investing 10% - 20% of his/her assets into gold as either long-term savings or a “wealth insurance” policy, would likely welcome a period of lower prices should they manifest. After all, buying an asset for lower prices over the short-run can lead to a lower dollar-cost average price for the long-term holding.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, those with a shorter-term time horizon might choose to pay closer attention to the resolution of the chart pattern shown above. If the pattern resolves higher, gold is calculated to see a surge of $200 - $300 within the following 12 months. However, if the pattern resolves lower, an equally large decline is what the target calls for. These might sound like two extreme scenarios – yet these are exactly the types of moves that are predicted from the resolution of converging consolidation patterns.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are now in the terminal last months of gold’s consolidation. Readers should not assume that gold will remain so quiet going forward as it has over the past year. Please stay tuned as we zero in on leading indicators over the next few months which should help us gain insight into gold’s coming resolution in one direction or the other.  </span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,242.50 (+0.39%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.30 (+0.67%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $936.30 (+0.41%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $871.95 (-0.37%), Dow Jones index 21,629.72 (0.04% decrease)</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals  </b></h3>
One of the biggest news today, that the U.S. Dollar dropped to its lowest level since August 2016 against the major currencies on Tuesday, after Republicans discarded the previous plan to repeal Obamacare. Collapse appeared on late Monday meeting when Republicans leaders did not even have enough votes even to begin to debate on the regulation. US markets and investors are losing confidence that President Trump will be able to deliver his promised plans about tax reforms. Gold price rose to a two-week high on Tuesday supported by the weaker dollar and at this moment gold is likely to be on the increasing track. Among other precious metals: silver is trading higher today, platinum rose and touched one-month high, palladium price slightly dropped.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened mixed S&amp;P 500 2459.14 (-0.01%) and NASDAQ Index 6314.43 (+0.03%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21629.72 (-0.04%).</span>

Wall Street major indexes were mixed in early trading, weighed down by the latest earnings reports from some big companies and concerns ability to follow on its economic agenda, following a setback to the health care bill. At the same time, economic data shows that confidence in U.S. economy's future after Trump's election.

Oil prices rose on Tuesday as demand soaked up some of the surplus supplies from OPEC and the United States, but investors consider there are a few signs of big short-term moves.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals  </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index is trading slightly higher on Wednesday morning. There has been no change in the main fundamentals so what investors witness today is probably short-term change ahead of central bank meetings in Japan and Eurozone. Weighing on the dollar was expected yesterday after the collapse of Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare in the Senate. Gold price slightly increased today despite stronger US Dollar Index, market analytics consider the gold price will continue to rise higher or at least remain bullish level and stay above this steady level. Among other precious metals: silver price slightly rose, platinum lost a few points, palladium price is also up.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened mixed S&amp;P 500 2460.61 (+0.06%) and NASDAQ Index 6344.31 (+0.47%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21574.73 (-0.25%).</span>

Wall Street main Indexes are slightly higher on Wednesday, following the weaker than expected bank shares and rising tech stocks.

The “Trump’s Administration” rally helped push stocks on record highs over the past weeks. Investors will be monitoring U.S.-China talks on Wednesday. Senior officials from the U.S. and China have scheduled meeting about finance, trade, and markets today.

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,243.00 (-0.06%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.37 (-0.06%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $926.75 (-0.12%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $845.00 (-0.18%), Dow Jones index 21,622.43 (0.08% decrease). </i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals  </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar Index is trading lower today against a basket of major currencies, weighed down by weaker than expected economic data over the past several months. Some market experts believe that a weaker dollar can help to boost earnings of Wall Street Indexes. Gold price slightly dropped as the dollar edged higher. Market analytics are waiting for a meeting of the European Central Bank later on Thursday. Among other metals: the major precious metals prices dropped today. </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened slightly higher S&amp;P 500 2475.36 (+0.06%) and NASDAQ Index 6386.31 (+0.03%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21622.43 (-0.08%).</span>

Wall Street Indexes are mostly weighted by political uncertainty recently; market analytics say it’s uncommon that the President’s Administration affects the market so often.  The current Wall Street roller coaster cannot last forever.

The European Central Bank will take center stage on Thursday. Investors are highly focused because the bank might keep interest rates steady. Investors will be on alert for any change in language when president Mario Draghi speaks.

<b>Economic data: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekly jobless claim, Advance trade in goods, Durable goods orders.   </span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,252.90 (+0.60%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.54 (+0.78%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $943.55 (+0.97%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $853.95 (+0.44%), Dow Jones index 21,532.92 (0.36% decrease). </i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals  </b></h3>
US Dollar Index was trading lower on Friday morning, weighed down by the European Central Bank's discussion in the fall a plan to pare back its bond purchases. The dollar is also staying under pressure because of concerns the Russian investigation could slow down tax reform and other pro-growth policies of the Trump administration. Gold price market has been supported by the weaker dollar. Gold price is steady on Friday and stays on positive track after reaching a three-week high this week.

Among other precious metals: silver price slightly rose today, platinum and palladium prices are also trading higher.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2468.33 (-0.20%) and NASDAQ Index 6380.92 (-0.13%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21532.92 (-0.36%).</span>

Wall Street Indexes opened lower today with no economic data to focus on, much of the market’s direction was driven by the companies earnings out early Friday.

Most investors have kept their eyes on companies earnings reports this week and geopolitical tension.

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,259.20 (+0.25%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.66 (+0.60%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $942.70 (+0.29%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $852.30 (+0.37%), Dow Jones index 21,547.57 (0.15% decrease)</i></b>

After the previous light economic week, here is a new week ahead, when global financial markets will focus on the results of Wednesday’s Federal Reserve policy meeting for any new clues about the next U.S. rate hike. There are also several key U.S. economic reports, with the U.S. advanced second-quarter GDP on Friday. Investors’ focus will also be on headlines coming out of Washington, where the Senate is expected to continue working to repeal Obamacare.The investigation about U.S. President Donald Trump campaign’s ties to Russia will also continue to get investors and analytics attention.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
US Dollar Index gained points on Monday, but still being affected by the political issues. The dollar’s index is weaker against a basket of major currencies and pressured by the US political front of the Trump’s administration’s plan on tax reform and infrastructure spending. Gold price is on the highest level in four weeks today, supported by political uncertainty and unsteady US Dollar. Investors are getting more careful about what is going to happen this week and consider gold as a safe haven. Among other precious metals: silver price rose on Monday, platinum and palladium prices are also up.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2469.06 (-0.14%) and NASDAQ Index 6388.96 (+0.02%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21547.57 (-0.15%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading lower on Monday ahead of busy economic data week, that could be a make-or-break week for U.S. stock market. Investors also stayed focused on the outcome of earnings reports this week. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. President Donald Trump will make a statement on health care today at 3:15 after unsuccessful try and lack of support to replace Obamacare last week.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest news from the White House is the spokesman’s Sean Spicer’s resignation on Friday.

		<title>Silver Fundamentals and the Gold/Silver Ratio</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">Gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> have recovered moderately over the past two weeks, yet still remain within the confines of the ongoing consolidations we have been monitoring over the last several months. For the week, gold rose 2.2% or $27 to close at $1,255 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile, silver posted a gain of 3.3% or $0.52 cents, to close at $16.46. Over the short run, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">Silver's</a> recovery and close on a weekly basis above the key $16 level is certainly a positive sign that buyers remain ready to step in anytime the price drops into the $15’s.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is periodically beneficial to focus not only on gold and silver themselves in isolation but to examine the ratio between the two metals. In other words, we are referring to the number of ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a backdrop, readers should know that in general throughout history, a falling gold to silver ratio has tended to correspond with rising prices in both precious metals, whereas a rising gold to silver ratio has tended to correspond with falling prices in the metals. Of course, there are exceptions to every rule, but this is the prevailing trend that we observe when examining the ratio throughout history.</span>
<h3><b>Why does a falling gold to silver ratio correspond with rising gold and silver prices?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several reasons for this phenomenon. First, the silver market is extremely small compared to the gold market. For example, in 2016 just over 1 billion ounces of silver were produced from mining and scrap supply. Yet of this, approximately 80% or 800 million ounces were used for industrial fabrication: a combination of jewelry, silverware, electronics, solar panels, and photography. This silver was essentially “consumed” by industry or permanently taken off the market. What this means is that in 2016, only 200 million ounces were available for investment demand.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the industry has consumed the majority of silver for several decades, it is estimated that only 2-3 billion ounces exist above ground in readily investible form, meaning coins and bars. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare this to gold, in which the industrial demand is tiny in that only 16% of the 128 million ounces purchased in 2016 were used for fabrication. Of course, this means that 84% of the gold produced in 2016 is still available to the market in one form or another.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taken as a sum, we can see that in dollar terms, the total physical silver available in investible form pales in comparison to the total quantity of gold available. Most of the silver brought to market has been consumed by industry over the last 50 years. Not so with gold.</span>
<h3><b>What Happens in a Rising Gold Price Environment?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the much greater quantity of gold than silver that exists above ground for investment purposes, we must consider what happens in a rising precious metals price environment. Gold prices initially begin to rise due to purchases from larger players: central banks, institutions, sovereign wealth funds, and some forward-looking individuals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the rare exception (Warren Buffet bought 130 million ounces in 1998), silver is generally not the target of the central bank or institutional demand. Yet, importantly, silver is the target of individual investor demand. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The real power in the silver market lies in the potential for it to become the primary target for the individual investor. In a rising metals price backdrop, there will come a point when the average person does not have the resources available to purchase an ounce of gold. Where will he turn?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout history, the answer is silver.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine that an investor desires to move $10,000 into precious metals and that he chooses to split this investment evenly at 50% gold and 50% silver. With that split at today’s prices, he will just barely purchase 4 ounces of gold, yet over 300 ounces of silver (ignoring premiums). Again, let us remember that despite their vastly different values, there is more physical gold available above ground than silver. So here, by splitting a purchase evenly between the two metals, a single investor has taken possession of a much greater quantity of the world’s investable silver than of that for gold.</span>
<h3><b>What if 10% of the Population Wanted to Buy 10 Ounces of Silver?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now consider a scenario for the future, that as gold exceeds $1,500 in the years ahead, the average investor is largely priced out of the gold market. Again, where will he turn?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If 10% of the United States’ 320 million citizens each wanted to purchase 10 ounces of silver, the entire available investment supply for the year would be wiped out. What if 10% of the world’s 7.5 billion people each wanted to own 10 ounces? </span>
<h3><b>Returning to the Gold to Silver Ratio</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential for the precious metals, and especially silver, is significant over the years to come. While the ongoing corrections could continue for some time further, investors should carefully consider the underlying supply and demand fundamentals for the precious metals which will eventually exert themselves. In a rising gold price environment, silver will often lag initially, but when it does begin to gain interest from the average investor, even a modest inflow of capital into the “lesser” metal will have an oversized effect on its price. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We close with a long-term look at the gold to silver ratio. Currently, at 76 ounces of silver to purchase one ounce of gold, at the last precious metals peak in 1980, this ratio hit 17. As we can see, there have been several multi-year uptrends in favor of gold, amidst what appears to be a generational decline in the ratio (in favor of silver). Our expectation is that by the time the current cycle ends, the ratio will once again reach levels last seen in 1980.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar stabilized and seemed pretty steady on Thursday following the latest economic data and Fed’s meeting results, but still near a 13-month low. The Federal Reserve announced that it won’t raise interest rates and this decision was not a  surprise for investors. Gold price rose on Thursday, supported by the weak dollar and The US Federal Reserve updated news. Investors consider the after  Fed announcements the near-term risk of the economy seems pretty neutral. Among the other precious metals:  silver and platinum rose today, palladium price increased over 1%.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2480.71 (+0.12%) and NASDAQ Index 6444.68 (+0.34%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21782.50 (+0.33%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today after the Fed’s two-day meeting ended yesterday. Economic analytics suggest the stocks climbed to new heights this summer despite the President’s administration hasn’t implemented its economic agenda through Congress.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
The US Dollar Index was on a stable level this week, fell only on Wednesday after the Fed’s final statement, and dropped lower against the other major currencies on Friday, approaching the 13-month weak level after U.S. growth economic data yesterday.

Here is a new week ahead with global financial markets’ focus on this week’s US employment report and how it will impact the Fed’s view on monetary policy through the end of the year. Market investors will also focus on a monetary policy decision from the Bank of England amid recent calls from policymakers for higher interest rates in the months ahead. This will be a busy week in the US as a new month begins. There is no Fed meeting in August so that investors will rely on U.S. economic data for a long-term direction and any boosts for US Dollar Index.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
US Dollar Index started this week on the higher level, but still couldn’t break its ongoing downtrend which was stable in the recent weeks. Stocks are focused on the positives of generally US companies earnings news, and any signs of improved economic activity.  Gold price climbed on early  Monday sessions, being steady and around its highest seven weeks level. Among other precious metals: silver price gained some points on Monday, platinum and palladium prices were also trading higher.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened mixed S&amp;P 500 2472.10 (-0.13%) and NASDAQ Index 6374.68 (-0.12%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21830.31 (+0.15%).</span>

Wall Street Indexes were higher on Monday, suggesting stock futures would close out one of its strongest months of 2017 with this start of the month.

The earning season has largely provided positive surprises for investors and helped stock market indexes to rise recently, even there is still a huge political tension. North Korea tested a new ballistic missile last week which landed in the Sea of Japan, raising concerns that more parts of the US could be at risk. President Trump announced that China should be doing more to control North Korea and that the US would rethink the economic and political lines to Asia for resolving a  North Korean problem in a peaceful manner.

		<title>US Dollar Approaching Critical Support</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important for precious metals investors to follow the valuation of the US dollar versus other foreign currencies because as a general principle, being the world’s reserve currency still to this day, when the dollar sees periods of rapid decline investors tend to seek safety… and some of that safety flow will move into precious metals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we chart the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies including the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, and the Canadian dollar. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the false breakout at multi-decade highs last January, the US dollar has declined with such ferocious momentum that it has surprised even our initial outlook from this past spring. Our initial target to the downside was 95.5 (green callout) and this level has not only been hit but exceeded. In the wake of a dovish indication from the Federal Reserve last week that it may not desire to “normalize” its balance sheet as quickly as many assumed, the USD has continued to plummet all the way down to the nearly 3-year “Critical Support Zone” labeled below in black. This zone extends from 91.9 to 93.1 on the dollar index.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2312 " src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/US-Dollar-Index.png" alt="US Dollar Index" width="830" height="491" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having closed at 93.1 for the week, the dollar is now effectively testing this critical support zone.</span>
<h3><b>Dollar Set for a Technical Bounce</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the short term, we would expect the dollar to bounce in this region. </span><b>The nature of the bounce will be important to monitor.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The false breakout pattern at a multi-decade high is a rare and significant technical signal for a possible long-term reversal, and so we expect that a bounce from current levels for the dollar will not be anything more than a relief rally, not to exceed the declining (dashed blue) downtrend line. This scenario is highlighted in green.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A less probable scenario would be that the dollar stages a more significant relief rally which breaks its new downtrend, but which does not exceed the resistance zone between 99.5 – 100.5.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The strength of the expected bounce will tell us much about the dollar going forward. Should the dollar stage a larger rally, it will be signaling that the decline we expect over the coming years will be slower and more grinding in nature, perhaps taking an equal 8-years to fall to all-time lows near 72 on the index, levels last seen in 2008.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, should the dollar merely show a weak bounce, staying below its new trendline, not exceeding 95.5 on the way higher and then plunging through the critical support zone, the stage will be set for a more immediate and precipitous drop in the US currency over just the next 12 months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Take, for example, the period to the far left of the chart from mid-2014 to early-2015, in which the dollar rose from 80 to 100.5 within eight months. It is entirely conceivable that in a precipitous dollar decline, the greenback could return just as quickly to the 79-80 region over a similar time frame. This would equate to nearly a 15% further drop in just a year.</span>
<h3><b>Long-Term Dollar Indicator</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider our monthly momentum indicator for the dollar, dating back to the mid-1980’s. According to this model, </span><b>the top just seen in the dollar was the most significant of the past 30 years, </b><b>registering an even more overbought reading than the 2001-2003 top</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For reference, recall that the decline which began in the dollar in 2001 at 118 on the index coincided with the all-time low in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> at $255 per ounce.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2313 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/US-Dollar-Index-Monthly.png" alt="US Dollar Index Monthly" width="1047" height="736" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider, too, that the decline which followed the 2001 top resulted in over a 40% loss in the value of the dollar in just six years. Were such a percentage decline to occur again from this greater-magnitude signal, the target would be 62 on the index by 2023, or of the Y-axis below the chart. </span>
<h3><b>Metals Have Not Responded to USD Weakness… Yet</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, what remains to be seen is: when do <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> begin to respond to the dollar’s decline? From 2003 – 2008, there was a strong day-to-day inverse correlation between the dollar and gold. Recently, however, precious metals traders have been largely ignoring the bulk of the decline in the US dollar up to this point.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When will traders begin to notice the decline in the world’s reserve currency? We cannot say for certain, but we will begin to pick up the change in behavior when it registers on the charts, as we should begin to see $10 - $20 spikes in gold on specific days when the dollar falls by 0.5% - 1.0% on the index.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whichever form the pending bounce takes will tell us much about the strength or lack thereof for the dollar to be expected over the next several years.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
The U.S. dollar index increased on Tuesday, presenting a slight recovery after 15-month low hit, however investors continue to be concerned about weak dollar index, U.S. inflation and reduced bets on the Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes. Low US inflation is likely to encourage the U.S. Fed to consider another interest rate hike before the end of this year. Gold price increased on Tuesday, supported by the uncertainness in the future direction of US currency and soft inflation. Investors are looking ahead to the US non-farm payrolls data later this week and how that could affect the dollar. Among other precious metals: silver slightly lower today, palladium and platinum prices are also higher.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2475.08 (+0.19%) and NASDAQ Index 6359.51 (+0.17%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21955.67 (+0.29%).</span>

Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today, supported by the latest economic reports and geopolitical tension. Donald Trump announced on Monday that U.S. would “handle” North Korea, which has tested ballistic missiles.

The biggest news investors are waiting for today- “bitcoin cash”. The digital currency specialists officially completed the process to split the currency in two. The analytics confirmed the official coding the new bitcoin cash blockchain starts on Tuesday. Analysts estimated the divide into bitcoin and "bitcoin cash" would also occur later today.

		<title>Bitcoin has forked creating the new Bitcoin Cash</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The leading digital currency has officially forked today. Bitcoin power brokers couldn’t adopt a single solution which would have preserved the integrity of the famous cryptocurrency, forcing it to split in Bitcoin and the newly created Bitcoin Cash, causing BTC trade slightly lower this Tuesday morning.</span>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">**</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The civil war between developers and miners over Bitcoin’s future has caused the well-known cryptocurrency to fork today. While core developers wanted to keep bitcoin network’s blocks intact to protect it from hacks, some miners have aggressively promoted their solution of speeding up the network by increasing the block’s size.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The risk of getting Bitcoin transactions stuck in limbo for hours or days, therefore, increasing the next blocks’ cost (since the miners’ fee will also get higher), determined the Bitcoin community to come up with a new solution of speeding up the Bitcoin transactions’ approval process by forking the digital currency.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A fork is a "change to the software of the digital currency that creates two separate versions of the blockchain with a shared history." There were disagreements on whether to adopt a soft or hard fork – to create a new chain and ‘wipe out’ the weakest one or to permanently split the chain and create two Bitcoin versions. In the end, the hard fork was the one adopted after Tuesday’s morning deadline, generating a new Bitcoin – the Bitcoin Cash. The major difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is the block size, 1MB vs. 8MB, which is a promise of a faster transaction approval.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The hard fork created an identical blockchain, so it mirrored the people’s existing bitcoin wealth in Bitcoin Cash. The new digital currency was immediately bootstrapped by in-built value. Futures for the new Bitcoin gave back all of an initial 48% hike to $422 but traded 12% lower near $255 as of 1:53 PM, ET.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Forks had occurred in cryptocurrencies before, like the Bitcoin's rival, Ethereum, which also forked in 2016 and created the form of the digital currency we know today. Bitcoin miners have been able to mine for new bitcoins since this morning yet the first Bitcoin cash was reportedly mined at about 2:20 PM. Some analysts noted that Bitcoin Cash required the same amount of computational work as the original Bitcoin, but a significantly smaller number of miners are trying to create the new cryptocurrency.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Cash’s larger block size may prompt investors to forsake Bitcoin in new currency’s favor, which would be negative for the price of the original Bitcoin. Since the Bitcoin Cash has drawn its initial value from Bitcoin's market capitalization, it caused the bitcoin's value slightly drop after its adoption. Though, the entire market is still keeping an eye on the Bitcoin Cash to see " how the situation evolves."</span>

<em><strong>Important: Despite the fork, please keep in mind that if you want to <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/how-to/buy-gold-with-bitcoin">buy gold with Bitcoin</a> at Bullion Exchanges still accepts only the regular Bitcoin (BTC).</strong></em>]]></content>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index is trading lower on the regular Wednesday session weighed down by the new high level of Euro. Meanwhile, investors believe that political uncertainty in the U.S. is still the biggest driver for US Dollar declines.  Gold price started Wednesday lower as investors took profits after the latest US economic data released yesterday.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil prices traded higher as Brent crude futures rose 0.34 percent to trade at $52.43 per barrel. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest news for investors this week that the leading digital currency - Bitcoin was officially forked yesterday.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US dollar index lost some points on Thursday, but seem to be back on the rebounding track ahead of the  U.S. Department of Labor will announce the jobless claims today. The dollar remained under pressure over political turmoil in Washington and recent weak economic reports, which have raised doubts over the strength of US economy. Gold price dropped today from the near seven-week highs hit. Investors consider that US economy will likely to be strong enough for the Fed to increase rates in September. Among other precious metals: silver price slightly decreased, platinum price is also trading higher palladium price also dropped.  </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2474.14 (-0.14%) and NASDAQ Index 6349.78 (-0.19%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22029.44 (+0.06%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today after the Dow Jones Average broke the 22,000 level for the first time in its 121-year history. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A bunch of factors weigh down stock markets this week: the prospect of a hike in U.S. interest rates later this year; worries over China’s rising debt; a U.S. employment report for July that will be released Friday; weaker commodity prices; and tensions between Beijing and Washington over a hostile North Korea. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new ban on travel by US passport holders to North Korea will take effect on September,1. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bank of England will announce its latest interest rate decision on Thursday. It will also release its quarterly inflation report, offering a detailed picture of the British economy.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index looks steady today after being </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">near 15-month lows hit earlier this week.The dollar weakening on news of developments in the ongoing US elections investigations also assisted gold quite a bit. However,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investors suggest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">greenback could present unique opportunities for Wall Street Indexes. Gold price significantly dropped today,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">as the US reported stronger-than-expected jobs data for July. Investors are cautious ahead of the upcoming economic data on Friday and that is why it's been a bit messy in morning session. Among other precious metals: silver slightly dropped today, palladium price is also down, meanwhile platinum price is trading higher.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2478.79 (+0.27%) and NASDAQ Index 6356.39 (+0.22%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22074.75 (+0.22%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">after the closely watched July jobs report came in stronger than expected yesterday</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">America has added more than a  million new jobs since President Trump took office. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. economy added a strong 209,000 jobs in July, more than economists had expected. The unemployment rate fell to 4.3%, matching a 16-year low. Just after the Great Recession in 2009, unemployment peaked at 10%.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average crossed the 22,000 mark for the first time.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Now </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">markets are awaiting July's employment report, due later in the session, for clues on whether it will impact the timing of the US Federal Reserve's policy tightening. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a new week ahead with a  focus on U.S. several important economic data points, with  Friday inflation report, which may affect the timing of the next Federal Reserve rate hike. Several Fed speakers are also scheduled this week, which could bring us more insights about the central bank monetary policy. This week also brings a rare quiet moment in politics, with President Trump on a 17-day vacation.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
US Dollar Index is trading lower today, compared with the last week when greenback was supported by the stronger-than-expected jobs data last week. Gold price slightly dropped at the beginning of the week, weighed down by recovering US Dollar. Investors think gold is going to trade in a very tight range this week, because of the low level of liquidity in the market due to the holidays in Asia. Among other precious metals: platinum climbed today, silver price and palladium price decreased at the beginning of the week.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2476.77 (+0.01%) and NASDAQ Index 6360.47 (+0.15%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22093.24 (+0.03%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today, Dow Jones Industrial Average </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hit an intraday record shortly after opening Monday, adding to last week's record-setting performance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week will be filled with retail companies releasing quarterly results, which continue to be supportive for stocks. Economic data have also been mostly positive lately. Last week, the Labor Department announced the U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs last month, much more than expected that likely clear the way for the Fed to announce a plan to start shrinking its massive bond portfolio. </span>

<b>Economic data for this week:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Consumer credit </span><b>(Monday), Job openings</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Tuesday), Wholesale inventories </span><b>(Wednesday),</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Weekly jobless claim </span><b>(Thursday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Consumer Price Index </span><b>(Friday).</b>

		<title>Are Gold and the Japanese Yen Equal? (Part I)</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In past articles, we have discussed the generally-antagonistic relationship between <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold </a>and the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/31/us-dollar-approaching-critical-support/">US dollar</a>. Still to this day the world’s reserve currency, as precious metals investors we must always keep a close eye on the value of the dollar, as gold stands to be a primary beneficiary if in fact the dollar ever loses a significant amount of value in the future.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the value of the dollar versus all foreign currencies must regularly be considered, there is one cross-pair that deserves special attention for its relationship with gold. And that is the dollar versus the Japanese yen. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise labeled “JPY/USD”, we are hereby referring to the value of the Japanese yen as priced in US dollars. How is JPY/USD related to gold?</span>
<h3><b>JPY/USD and Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The clearest way to show the importance of the JPY/USD cross-pair and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is to plot a direct comparison between the two. Below we show JPY/USD (multiplied by 100 for scale) on top, with the price of gold immediately below, since the 2011 peak in gold at $1,923 per ounce:</span>

<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2353" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Japanese-Yen_comparison.png" alt="Japanese Yen_comparison" width="531" height="549" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The similarity between these two charts is striking. For example, note how the absolute highs for both gold at $1,923 per ounce and for JPY/USD at 1.32 occurred in Q3 2011. Note too how the large drop in gold which occurred between October 2012 and June 2013 when the metal fell from $1,800 down to $1,175 coincided precisely with the JPY/USD decline from 1.30 down to 0.98. Both continued to bring lower until 2015.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both assets also surged simultaneously during the first half of 2016, only to give back much of those gains in tandem during the second half of the year.</span>
<h3><b>Ratio Plot</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to view the relationship between these two assets is in the form of a ratio. Below we plot JPY/USD divided by the price of gold, since 1998. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In plain English, this ratio asks: “How does the value of the Japanese yen compare to the value of gold?”</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2354" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Japanese-Gold-ratio.png" alt="Japanese ,Gold ratio" width="1144" height="588" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see that over time the graph has moved lower. This means that over the past two decades the Japanese yen has lost considerable value versus gold; in other words, gold has risen as priced in yen. This should generally be expected, as we know all fiat currencies are being debased by their respective central banks over time.</span>
<h3><b>The Yen / Gold Correlation</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">What is perhaps not so expected is to see the tight correlation since late-2011 that has developed between the Japanese yen and the price of gold.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This correlation can be seen on the lower right corner of the chart via the blue converging trendlines, with the nearly flat price action since 2011.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When a ratio such as this flat lines, it tells us that the two components are highly positively correlated: the two assets are moving closely in tandem. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this instance, the flat line in the ratio confirms that the Japanese yen to US dollar cross pair is behaving nearly identically to the price of gold. In other words, </span><b>since 2011 the yen and gold are behaving as the same asset class.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The proof for this statement is visible in the first set of charts that we have shown.</span>
<h3><b>Yen and Gold – the Same?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, fundamentally we know that the Japanese yen and gold are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the same asset classes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, one is a fiat currency which may be printed ad infinitum by a central bank, while the other is a finite element which has served as a store of wealth for at least 5,000 years.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundamentally, the yen and gold are certainly not equal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, as we see from the graphs above, the market is treating the two as essentially the same since 2011. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are we, as investors, to make the nearly perfect correlation between the Japanese currency and gold? Why are these two markets so tightly intertwined? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, when will the correlation cease, and how can we use this knowledge in our investment plans going forward?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will address these questions and more in Part II of this series on the Japanese yen versus gold, next week…</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index edged slightly lower on Tuesday against the bucket of the major currencies, following the aftermath of the last week economic data. The greenback continues to be supported by strong nonfarm payrolls data, which met expectations that Fed will follow its plan for a third rate hike this year. Gold price is higher today as the dollar is still weak and there is no full clarity about Fed monetary policy. Among other precious metals: silver rose today, platinum and palladium also gained points. Palladium touched its highest level over the week in a  previous session.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2481.74 (+0.03%) and NASDAQ Index 6386.19 (+0.04%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22129.03 (+0.05%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today, with investors waiting for US inflation numbers later this week. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive economic data and strong company earnings have helped nudge the stock market mostly higher in recent weeks. Market analytics have welcomed the positive earning growth by pushing the market indexes further.  </span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,274.80 (+0.46%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.88 (+0.80%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $982.50 (+0.24%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $989.35 (-0.44%), Dow Jones index 22,046.92 (0.30% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
US Dollar turned on positive track on Wednesday after the stronger-than-expected economic data from the Labor Department yesterday and market speculation about future Fed interest rates. Gold price increased today because of the rising tension between the United States and North Korea. On Wednesday North Korea announced the possible plan for a missile strike on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, just a few minutes after Donald Trump said that any threat to the United States would be met with “fire and fury.” Investors think that North Korea situation will continue to provide little support for prices but not enough to push them significantly higher. However, geopolitical risks can boost demand for safe haven assets such as gold. Among other precious metals: silver slightly rose today, platinum gained a few points, palladium decreased.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2465.52 (-0.36%) and NASDAQ Index 6324.03 (-0.71%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22046.92 (-0.30%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street indexes dropped today weighed down by the geopolitical situation between the U.S. and North Korea. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tensions have risen since North Korea carried out two nuclear bomb tests last year and two ICBM tests last month.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The ratcheting up of tensions rattled global financial markets and prompted warnings from U.S. officials and analysts not to engage in rhetorical slanging matches with North Korea.</span>

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wholesale inventories, Unit Labor costs.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Are Gold and the Japanese Yen Equal? (Part II)</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/07/are-gold-and-the-japanese-yen-equal-part-i/">Part 1 of this series</a> last week, we examined the relationship between the Japanese yen and gold. We showed that both yen and gold have been highly correlated since 2011, moving closely in tandem during both corrections and surges since their respective peaks nearly six years ago.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As precious metals investors, what are we to make of this correlation? And how can we use the correlation to our advantage in the future?</span>
<h3><b>Why Does the Correlation Exist?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, let us address the “why” behind the yen/<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> correlation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line is that no one truly knows why the correlation exists because correlations between diverse asset classes never exist for solely one reason. Anyone who claims to have “the” answer in reality only has one of the said answers – because markets are made up millions of individuals, each acting on their own particular causes and assumptions. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, we can look to identify some contributing causes. Much of the correlation has to do with the perceived safety status of the Japanese yen. Although still a fiat currency, the yen in recent years has come to be known in the international trade as one of the safest currencies in the world, perhaps even more so than the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/31/us-dollar-approaching-critical-support/">US dollar. </a></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan is notable for its low inflation relative to other developed world economies. Although the country has a large public debt, much of that debt is held domestically by investors. Japan also has a significant trade surplus, selling more to foreign trade partners than it imports. The yen-carry trade, a popular funding mechanism of the past decade in which investors borrow Japanese yen to buy assets in foreign countries, is a testament to the perceived stability of the Japanese economy and its ultra-low interest rates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these reasons contribute to the safe-haven status of the yen, which in turn drives the correlation with gold.</span>
<h3><b>Looking for Confirmation Signals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there is a myriad of reasons why the correlation is in place, for our purposes it will be more valuable to accept that it does indeed exist, and to next look for ways to utilize this information. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the more valuable forms of analysis we can thereby perform is to monitor for either confirmation or non-confirmation signals between the yen to dollar cross-pair (JPY/USD) and gold. These can help us gauge major turning points in the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in June 2015 gold began to make new lows under the $1,200/oz mark, eventually hitting $1,045 in December of that year. However, note that the Japanese yen failed to make a new similar low, instead of increasing marginally from 0.7950 to 0.8125 during this time:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2394" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Jap-Yen-to-US-Dollar.png" alt="Jap Yen to US Dollar" width="652" height="685" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall the main chart from last week’s article, showing the near perfect correlation over six years between the pair. Here in 2015 was a non-confirmation signal for gold’s final plunge in 2015. The yen and gold were, in fact, moving in opposite directions as a net sum over the final months of the decline.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What did this non-confirmation in the yen signal for gold? We will let the charts speak for themselves, by extending out the above by another seven months:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2395" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Japanese-Yen-to-US-Dollar.png" alt="Japanese Yen to US Dollar" width="645" height="691" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is clear that the non-confirmation signal in the yen in late 2015 was an excellent predictor of what is now seen as the final low for gold’s 2011 – 2015 bear market.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an important signal for those who are interested in gauging likely turning points in the gold market. Of course, no signal will be perfect 100% of the time. But we can push the odds of probability into our favor for the gold market if we pay attention to these confirmation or non-confirmation signals in the Japanese yen.</span>
<h3><b>Watch for the Correlation to End</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A final point on the topic for the time being: no correlation will last forever. There will come a time when – for fundamental reasons which will only be revealed after the fact – the tight correlation between the yen and gold will sever.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What more, the </span><b>period of time following the breaking of this relationship will be important for precious metals investors to pay attention to</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because it will signify either a rapid acceleration higher in the price of gold, or a severe plunge, depending on the direction in which the correlation breaks. To illustrate, refer to the following set of imbedded charts of the yen/gold ratio:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2396" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Japanese-Yen-and-Gold-ratio.png" alt="Japanese Yen and Gold ratio" width="932" height="874" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will know the correlation is ending when the yen/gold ratio breaks either above or below the converging set of (blue) trendlines which have defined the relationship since 2011. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When zoomed in (bottom chart), due to the extension of the y-axis on this timescale, it appears that there is much variability which can still occur in the confines of this relationship. However, when we refer back to the original (top) chart, we can see that in the grand scheme of these two asset classes, the correlation is still very tight indeed. A breaking point could come at any time within the next 12-24 months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the convergence breaks higher (less likely) it will signify that the yen is set to gain value relative to gold. Conversely, if the ratio breaks lower (more likely) it will hint that after six years gold is finally ready to resume leadership amongst the safe-haven assets again, with a price rise in all currencies including the yen.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,287.40 (+0.09%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.20 (+0.07%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $981.70 (+0.45%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $930.40 (+1.18%), Dow Jones index 21,973.75 (0.23% decrease)</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
The US Dollar edged higher against the major currencies on Thursday, supported by the latest economic reports. The greenback gained points after yesterday's data showed that the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week was less than expected. The key results of the Fed meeting in July also helped US Dollar to rise. Gold price increased on Thursday after it’s been pressured by a significant tension between North Korea and the United States earlier this week. Among other precious metals: silver price is slightly increased, platinum price is also higher, palladium price reached its one of the highest levels in last weeks.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2460.30 (-0.31%) and NASDAQ Index 6320.19 (-0.39%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21973.75 (-0.23%). </span>

Wall Street Indexes dropped lower today after President Trump announced that he would disband his advisory councils filled with leaders of corporate giants. The results of Fed's July meeting showed a split among FOMC members who wanted to keep the course and continue to raise rates and those who preferred the Fed slow down the process. Investors hope Fed will finally take a path for normalizing interest rates.

Wall Street traders expect to see if the retailer is making progress in the upcoming reports today.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
US Dollar Index dropped down today after news of a terrorist attack in Barcelona combined with Wall Street indexes going lower. The market was also distracted by the news that Gary Cohn was resigning as an economic adviser to President Donald Trump, but the White House didn’t confirm this information. Gold price moved higher but was still below the previous high levels. Among other precious metals: silver price was mostly unchanged, platinum and palladium prices are also up.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2424.47 (-0.23%) and NASDAQ Index 6216.12 (-0.13%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21721.76 (-0.13%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street indexes dropped down on Friday after Spain attack and political news that an economic adviser to President Donald Trump might resign. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Market participants are still focused today on the terror attack in Spain with a van plowing into crowds in one of Barcelona’s busiest venues, killing at least 14 people. European stocks were also sharply lower on Friday following the attacks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">US traders are mostly keeping an eye on the international news, because US Congress is currently on its summer recess, and this gives a little less political tension.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the main market’s uncertainty leads to the same doubts over whether the Fed will be able to raise rates again this year and clearly investors are growing more nervous about this concern.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,290.90 (+0.56%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.14 (+0.81%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $990.50 (+0.64%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $936.60 (+0.99%), Dow Jones index 21,657.63 (0.08% decrease).</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a new week ahead with a pretty quiet week for economic data, but with a new reason for investors' nervousness-changes within the Trump's Administration. Friday’s unexpected exit of Steve Bannon dominated investors attention. The President’s closest political advisor no longer has an access to the White House. The investors will also keep an eye on Central bankers annual meeting in Jackson Hole.The meeting will take place Thursday through Friday with the highlight being a speech about financial stability from Janet Yellen on Friday.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
The US Dollar Index is getting lower on Monday. Last week U.S. dollar held its ground against most of the major currencies. The prospect of escalating military tensions has been a key driver for the dollar recently. Gold price is little changed today as investors are waiting for the further direction after the last week of geopolitical uncertainty in the US and Europe terroristic attack and also ahead of the Central bankers’ meeting later this week. The gold reached its highest level since November on Friday. Among other precious metals: silver price is slightly higher, platinum and palladium prices are also up.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened mixed S&amp;P 500 2427.10 (+0.05%) and NASDAQ Index 6220.84(+0.07%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21657.63 (-0.08%). </span>

US stock indexes are trading mixed today, but mostly lower. Some analysts suggest that geopolitical tension and surprises in Washington have been keeping market away from the recovering path.

There are a few President Donald Trump’s speeches this week: the first one is about a path for U.S. strategy in Afghanistan in a nationally televised speech on Monday. On Tuesday, Donald Trump is scheduled to speak at a campaign-style rally in Phoenix as a response to the white-supremacist violence in Charlottesville.

Markets are also looking ahead to a top central bankers meeting later this week in Jackson Hole, where U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's speech will be monitored for clues on further interest rate hikes this year. The outcome of this meeting could affect both the gold price, because it is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, as much as the US Dollar Index.

<b>Economic data for this week: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago National Activity index </span><b>(Monday), </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing scheduled </span><b>(Tuesday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, New Home Sales </span><b>(Wednesday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Weekly jobless claims, Existing  Home Sales </span><b>(Thursday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Durable Goods Orders </span><b>(Friday).</b>

		<title>Gold Breakout – Higher Targets in Sight</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks ago <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> broke higher through the long-term declining downtrend which has defined the period of falling prices since 2011. That year, gold peaked at $1,923 per ounce, while <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> peaked just shy of $50. Over the past six years, despite many attempts to gather momentum to the upside, gold has been unable to overcome this key technical resistance level. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the surge of first-half 2016, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> has made no less than seven attempts to overcome this downtrend. Those attempts are highlighted on the chart below by the magenta-colored arrows. Each time gold reached this declining trend, sellers showed up, and forced the price back lower – sometimes by only $40 - $50 per ounce, yet sometimes by over $200 per ounce, as was seen last November.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2441" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Gold-2011-present.png" alt="Gold 2011- present" width="1060" height="793" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold has now made its most legitimate breakout attempt – and furthermore, it has sustained the breakout for two full weeks. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we examine price projections, we must note that for the breakout to remain valid, </span><b>prices must remain above $1,260 on a daily closing basis</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If this level were to fail, it would invalidate the breakout, and we would have (once again) another failed attempt. False-moves are possible in all markets, and the best way to handle them is to have a defined price point whereby if a failure occurs, we can examine alternate scenarios. Again, $1,260 must hold – and thus far, prices have done so.</span>
<h3><b>Breakout Importance</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of this trend break should not be underestimated. Many technical-based buyers have remained on the sidelines for the past six years as gold prices moved lower and then drifted sideways. A sustained break above a declining trendline is often a signal that investors will use to tell them the period of falling prices is likely over. We expect these investors will begin entering the gold market in the near future, and momentum will begin to build.</span>
<h3><b>Short-Term Resistance Levels</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next several weeks, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/05/gold-a-large-move-is-approaching/">gold</a> still must overcome the $1,300 zone as initial resistance. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,300 has held prices lower since the reversal which took place on the night of Trump’s victory, last November. This is presently the third attempt for gold to overcome this price, and each attempt represents a “chipping away” by buyers at the overhang of sellers who are exiting their positions near break even. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What will typically happen as a specific horizontal resistance level is preparing to be broken is that the reactions lower on each failure will become less and less severe, indicating buyers are stepping in at higher price points at every sell-off. In the near future, we expect $1,300 will be broken – and at that point, a whole new class of buyers will begin paying attention to the precious metals market.</span>
<h3><b>Intermediate Price Targets</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming gold can remain above $1,260 and soon recapture $1,300, thus solidifying the long-term downtrend break, we have much higher price targets ahead over the next 6-18 months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Three specific price targets occur within a close proximity, and this confluence represents our highest probability target:</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consolidation which took place from December 2015 through August 2017 featured an amplitude of $330 per ounce, from the low of $1,045 to the high of $1,375. This consolidation took place in the form of a giant triangle-shaped formation. In technical analysis when triangle-consolidation breaks, the target is derived from an equal measurement of the amplitude ($330), added onto the apex of the triangle ($1,205). This calculation gives a target of $1,535. </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is clear horizontal resistance visible on the chart at $1,525 (black line). This level formerly acted as support in 2011 – 2013 and then failed on the fourth test in early 2013. Generally, defined former support levels will subsequently act as resistance on the next attempt to overcome them as sellers emerge.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire 2011 – 2015 decline comes in at $1,485. Fibonacci was an Italian mathematician of the 12</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century who discovered that many aspects of nature – sea shells, hurricanes, flower petals – all follow a similar ratio pattern. Financial markets often follow these similar patterns, the markets being a component of (human) nature.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, </span><b>we have three strong technical targets between $1,485 - $1,535, and this level represents our highest probability for a future intermediate gold peak</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These targets should be reached within 6-18 months, depending on the host of geopolitical and market factors impacting the precious metals. These represent starting targets only, at which point new analysis will be required.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming gold maintains above $1,260 in the coming weeks, this technical breakout is significant and bears monitoring by investors. We expect that when $1,300 is broken, momentum will begin to pick up notably on the way to the higher targets. Investors may choose to accelerate a certain percentage of purchases as fitting in with an overall investment plan.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
The U.S. dollar gained some points on Thursday as the first day of the global central bankers meeting starts today potentially providing clues about the direction of global financial policy. Traders will be watching for any signals about the future policy and the rate hikes. Gold price slightly dropped today following President Donald Trump’s speech in Phoenix about the promises of his campaign-the wall along the Mexican border. He even said that he could consider a government shutdown in this matter. Among other precious metals: silver price is also slightly down, palladium and platinum prices are also up.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar slightly rose today ahead of key talk </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen scheduled for Friday. Gold price moved lower today. Traders and investors will closely watch the results of central bankers meeting for any clues on future monetary policy.

<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened higher S&amp;P500 2447.78 (+0.34%) and NASDAQ Index 6286.83 (+0.27%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21858.14 (+0.33%). </span>

While precious metals dropped down, Wall Street indexes increased today as investors prepared for key speeches from U.S. central bankers.

Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will give a speech on “Financial Stability”, which could probably provide new clues to the monetary policy.

Although analytics’ expectations are low, some experts suggest that the Fed chief could attempt to realign market expectations with the central bank’s own outlook that it will raise rates once more this year.

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,299.40 (+0.56%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.28 (+0.81%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $984.60 (+0.64%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $939.40 (+0.99%), Dow Jones index 21,786.83 (0.12% decrease).</i></b>

Here is a new week ahead of a busy economic data scheduled to release regarding inflation, jobs, and manufacturing followed by the Kansas City Federal Reserve’s central-banker conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. In speeches at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank’s symposium in Jackson Hole, Janet Yellen will be focused on banking regulations and economic improvements in the U.S. economy. US market participants are also trying to analyze the damage from Hurricane Harvey in Texas. The biggest issue that the Texas coast in general accounts for 30% of the entire oil refining capacity of the U.S., and almost 15% are from the region most directly affected by the storm.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
The US Dollar Index dropped lower near 92.30 today, following the speech by Chief J.Yellen at the Jackson Hole Symposium on Friday. The greenback is also pressured after U.S. President Donald Trump suggested a shutdown of the government and threatened<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Gold </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prices turned higher today extending gains from the previous session after US Federal Reserve Chair J. Yellen made no reference to US monetary policy in a speech at bankers meeting last week. Among other precious metals: silver edged up, platinum and palladium also rose today.  </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened mixed S&amp;P 500 2443.05 (+0.17%) and NASDAQ Index 6265.64(+0.07%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21786.83 (-0.12%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading mixed today, giving a slow start to a busy economic data week for investors. After Friday’s speech from Fed chair, market analytics will closely look at the jobs report this week. This week’s calendar also features U.S. data on personal income and spending.Markets continue to be skeptical that the Fed will raise rates a third time this year due to worries over the subdued inflation outlook. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most market headlines on Monday are focused on the hurricane Harvey in Texas, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blew through critical areas for the country’s oil and gas industry and has already caused some disruptions in production. Several companies announced that they are shutting down operations their refining and petrochemical complexes because of flooding. The reports say Harvey has already knocked out 11% of U.S. refining capacity.</span>

		<title>Thoughts on Precious Metals as Summer Winds Down</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">As summer winds down in the northern hemisphere, first and foremost our thoughts and prayers go out to those who are being impacted by the destruction of Hurricane Harvey in Texas.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer tends to be the slowest time of year for most of the financial markets. The phrase “sell in May and go away” summarizes the strategy that many traders take of exiting their positions at the end of the spring and not returning until after Labor Day. Although the precious metals occupy a unique space within the investment world, some of these same seasonal factors do impact the prices of the metals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us examine the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> seasonality chart, showing average monthly returns since 1975:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2477 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/a_seasonal.png" alt="Gold seasonality" width="681" height="344" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we can see, the May through July period is historically the slowest of the year for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>, featuring not only the lowest volatility but often an important price low forming in July.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The strong seasonal period begins in August and continues through September, largely as a result of physical demand from the Indian wedding and Chinese holiday seasons. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we should point out that after what is typically a weak month in October, gold still has four strong months ahead through February. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, the August through February period is the strongest time for precious metals historically, and we are now at the beginning of that period, with gold already having broken through its long-term downtrend technical resistance (<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/21/gold-breakout-higher-targets-in-sight/">see the article</a>, last week).</span>
<h3><b>Volatility Remains at Record Lows</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us not forget, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold</a> is approaching its strongest period of the year amidst what is still the lowest daily volatility observed over the past nine years. Below we update gold’s volatility chart:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2478 size-full" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b_vol.png" alt="Gold Index" width="686" height="266" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility is a direction-neutral measure. In other words, it only tells us that a period of higher volatility is set to follow, but not in which direction the upcoming moves will occur. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When we juxtapose strong seasonality factors emerging amidst a market that is within record-low volatility and already showing initial hints of technical breakouts, what we can say is that the precious metals are set for strong moves ahead. Our initial assessment is that those moves will be higher, but we will not take anything for granted and always keep one eye on the charts on a regular basis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The charts we feature here focus primarily on the “what” aspect of the market – they do not tell us the “why”. The metals are like dry tinder at present with lightning visible in the distance. The market is waiting for a spark… what could that be?</span>
<h3><b>Potential Sparks for Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tensions are brewing amongst US economic policymakers, and Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, gave an example of that on Friday. In a speech at the economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Yellen discussed the role that the US central bank had in propping up the financial system after the crash of 2008 through bailouts and increased regulation. The most prescient quote from the speech was as follows:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><b>Because of the reforms that strengthened our financial system</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>and with support from monetary and other policies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, credit is available on good terms, and lending has advanced broadly in line with economic activity in recent years, contributing to today’s strong economy.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we see Yellen hinting that she will not favor the loosening of regulations that were enacted after the financial crisis of 2008, something the Trump administration has pushed for in recent months. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yellen’s term as chairwoman is up this February and speculation is that Trump may not re-nominate her for the position. The speech at Jackson Hole tends to reinforce that a shakeup may be coming at the Fed early next year. And uncertainty in the financial system tends to provide support for gold.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, saber-rattling continues between the United States and North Korea. While gold price spikes based on the fear of isolated geopolitical events tend to not be sustained, certainly if any sort of extended political or military confrontation were to develop between these two nuclear powers, gold would see a sustained bid. At what point do these idle threats that we see quoted so often begin to be taken seriously by one side or the other?</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2479" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/c_korea-1.png" alt="" width="620" height="313" />
<h3><b>Takeaway on the End of Summer and Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial technical breakouts have already been observed on the charts in recent weeks.  Gold is entering its historically-strongest period of the year due to seasonal demand from India and China, amidst a backdrop of decade-low volatility. The precious metals are set to react strongly when a fundamental spark presents itself. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy your final week of the summer!  </span>

Meanwhile, gold price rose on Tuesday to its highest level since November as geopolitical tensions over a new North Korean missile launch as demand for safe-haven assets such as gold increased.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar Index is trading at the higher level on Wednesday after touching the lowest levels since January earlier this week.The greenback is still weighted down by the stronger euro and geopolitical tensions after North Korea’s missile launch. Meanwhile, gold price slipped today pressured by gains in the dollar, despite demand for safe-haven from investors. The dollar strength is taking points from the yellow metal. Among other precious metals: silver price decreased today, platinum and palladium prices also dropped.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2446.60 (+0.08%) and NASDAQ Index 6301.89(+0.30%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21865.37 (+0.26%).</span>

Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today after North Korea conducted a test of an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) to counter US and South Korean military drills.

Market analytics consider the tension between North Korea and the US reached levels unseen since 1994. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that “All options are on the table.”

However, the U.S. economy is looking stronger anyway, especially on the jobs front. Private employers added 237,000 working positions in August, according to the report released on Wednesday.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index is trading higher on Thursday against all major currencies, and it’s one more advance for greenback this week. Later today, investors will be focused on important economic reports, which could also drive US Dollar ( Core PCE Price Index, Personal Spending, and Personal Income). Gold price seems steady on Thursday, despite the stronger US Dollar and positive economic data. Among other precious metals: silver price slightly increased today, platinum price is down, palladium price is trading higher. </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2457.59 (+0.46%) and NASDAQ Index 6368.31(+1.05%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21892.43 (+0.12%).</span>

Wall Street indexes are trading higher on Thursday after inflation data raised expectations that Federal Reserve will hold off from increasing interest rates again this year. The weekly data precedes the more comprehensive monthly jobs report on Friday, which will help investors gauge the strength of the labor market as they look for clues on the Fed's next move on rates. North Korea recently conducted a missile test over Japan airspace, adding to tensions in the global political platform.

However, Mr.Trump talked up the latest speech on Wednesday in Springfield, Mo., laying out his plans for tax overhaul. Despite nearly uniform skepticism from mainstream economists, he insisted that much faster economic growth was within reach.

		<title>Celebrate Canada’s 150th Anniv. with unique Voyageur coins</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Canada marks its sesquicentennial  150th anniversary by releasing two exclusive pieces: the beautiful </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-1-oz-canadian-gold-150th-annv-voyageur-coin-in-assay">2017 $150 1 oz. 99.99% Pure Gold Canada 150 Special Edition Voyageur Coin </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-1-oz-silver-canadian-150th-annv-voyageur-coin">2017 $5 1 oz. Fine Silver Canada 150 Special Edition Voyageur Coin</a><b>. </b>Canadian Confederation was united into one Dominion of Canada on July 1, 1867. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Both coins feature the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">iconic “Voyageur” design originally created for 1935-1986 Canadian Silver Dollars.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">**</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the last summer day, the renowned Royal Canadian Mint delights its fans with two spectacular issues: the </span><b>2017 $150 1 oz. 99.99% Pure Gold Canada 150 Special Edition Voyageur Coin </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><b>2017 $5 1 oz. Fine Silver Canada 150 Special Edition Voyageur Coin </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">which bear on their reverse the legendary “Voyageur” image created by the talented Toronto sculptor - Emanuel Hahn.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The coin's design showcases a voyageur and a Native paddling a superb canoe swiftly moving past the windswept pines that dot a semi-circular island. Between them is a bundle of wrapped furs marked with “HB” as for Hudson’s Bay Company. In the background, stylized vertical rays represent the northern lights up the sky. This splendid image is a powerful nod to the industry which founded Canada, the fur trade industry, and was designed for the Canadian Voyageur Silver Dollar coins struck between 1935 and 1986. An astonishing symbol of Canadian character and spirit, these impressive coins were the first circulating silver dollars in Canada and were introduced to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of King George V.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The obverse sides of the Canada 150 anniversary releases carry the famous effigy of Her Majesty, created by Susanna Blunt, and the unique RCM bullion security features: the radial line background pattern and micro-engraved “17” maple leaf privy mark. Both coins are Canadian legal tender, have a weight of one troy ounce, struck from .9999 fine <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> and .9999 fine <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, with their weight and purity backed by the Government of Canada.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>2017 $5 1 oz. 99.99% Pure Silver Canada 150 Special Edition Voyageur Coin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bears the highest denomination seen on a 1 oz. silver bullion coin - $5 CAD while the </span><b>2017 $150 1 oz. Fine Gold Canada 150 Special Edition Voyageur Coin </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">carries the first-ever face value for a 1 oz. .9999 gold bullion coin - $150 CAD. The <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> piece also has a limited issue of just 15,000 coins and is housed in a fantastic assay card featuring the official Canada 150 emblem and the beautiful aurora borealis. These wonderful features make the coins a treasured addition to any bullion portfolio and a great gift for any RCM fan.</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 11</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span> editions of the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/government-mints/perth-mint">Perth Mint’s</a> highly popular Lunar II Series, the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2018-1-oz-gold-lunar-year-of-the-dog-bu-perth-mint">2018 Year of the Dog Lunar Gold </a>and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2018-1-oz-silver-lunar-year-of-the-dog-coin">2018 Year of the Dog Lunar Silver</a> will<span style="font-weight: 400;"> be released on September 11</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2017.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These magnificent coins celebrate the Year of the Dog, one of the twelve animals of the Chinese Calendar. The Lunar Years of the Dog are 1922, 1934, 1946, 1958, 1970, 1982, 1994, 2006 and 2018, and those who are born under this sign are considered as amiable, kind, friendly, and loyal. Meticulously struck from .9999 fine silver and gold in bullion quality, these exceptional coins are an excellent anniversary gift and a treasured addition to any portfolio.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reverse side of the 2018 Year of the Dog Silver Lunar Coin showcase a German Shepherd dog and pup lying in the grass with Chinese peony flowers in the background, framed by the inscriptions “Year of the Dog”, “P” mintmark and the Chinese character for “dog”. The gold coin’s reverse depicts a Labrador Retriever on rocks and featuring a stylized pine tree in the background encircled by the same inscriptions. Their obverse side displays the renowned effigy of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, courtesy of Ian Rank-Broadley, surrounded by the coin’s denomination, purity, weight and the engravings “Elizabeth II”, “Australia”, and “2018”.</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - September, 5</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,332.90 (+0.20%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.98 (+1.30%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $1012.00 (+0.85%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $985.60 (+1.22%), Dow Jones index 21,987.56 (0.18% increase).</i></b>

Here is a new week after long Labor Day holiday. The U.S. Congress returns from summer break on Tuesday and has a lot on its agenda. Debt limit issues and the emergency hurricane will be first and foremost on the list.The devastation from Hurricane Harvey may have increased the U.S. fiscal agenda. President Trump is expected to decide on whether or not to eliminate Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, facing a today’s deadline from conservative states that have threatened to challenge DACA in court. The large US companies and Silicon Valley are making a last-minute effort to press the White House to save DACA program. Fedspeak will dominate the calendar, and after the disappointing August jobs report, the market will be focused on scheduled data for this week.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
US Dollar fell on Tuesday, the first trading day of the week, as tension between North Korea and the West weighted down greenback. North Korea successfully tested a hydrogen bomb on Sunday that can be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile. This was North Korea's sixth nuclear test since 2006 and it's most powerful to date. The tension between the U.S. and North Korea has been escalating more and more recently. Gold price increased on Tuesday because investors around the world increased their exposure to traditional safe-haven assets like gold. Among other precious metals: silver price rose today, platinum and palladium price also up.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2476.55 (+0.20%) and NASDAQ Index 6435.33 (+0.07%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21987.56 (+0.18%). </span>

The U.S. stock market was closed on Monday because of the Labor Day holiday, and all main indexes are trading higher today. Low trading volume, as investors returned from a holiday weekend, added uncertainty to the slightly changing tone on Wall Street. After North Korea sharply raised the stakes Sunday in its standoff with the rest of the world, detonating a powerful nuclear device that it claimed was a hydrogen bomb that could be attached to a missile capable of reaching the mainland United States, investors have been searching for a catalyst that will lead to a steep market correction.
The next four months will be busy ones for investors as markets are heading into the end of the year. For sure, it will be a busy four months for markets analytics and September has historically been one of the most volatile months for stocks.

<b>Economic data for this week: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factory orders </span><b>(Tuesday), </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markit services PMI, ISM nonmanufacturing Index </span><b>(Wednesday), </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekly jobless claims, Unit labor cost </span><b>(Thursday), </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wholesale inventories, Consumer credit </span><b>(Friday).</b>]]></content>

		<title>Gold Breaks 2016 High in Japan… US to Follow?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest news for the precious metals investors this week was not the gain in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> or <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a>, nor the continued weakness in the US dollar. </span><b>The most important news for precious metals investors was the price increase of gold in Japanese yen terms. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">After several years of tight correlation, these markets are in the process of changing behavior, yet this important shift is still being largely ignored by the mainstream press. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In early August (</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/07/are-gold-and-the-japanese-yen-equal-part-i/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part 1 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/14/are-gold-and-the-japanese-yen-equal-part-ii/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part 2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) we covered the historically tight correlation that has existed between the Japanese yen and gold prices dating back to 2011. If you did not have the opportunity to do so, please check out those posts for a better understanding of the analysis that follows.</span>
<h3><b>Gold in Yen Breakout </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a>, as priced in Japanese yen, broke above its 2016 high in sudden fashion, rising from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¥141,300 per ounce to ¥146,095, a gain of 3.3%. The technical action is highlighted below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2530" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/a_GoldJPY.png" alt="Break above 2016 high " width="540" height="354" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We made the case in the past linked articles that a key determinant for a more significant precious metals advance in US dollar terms would be when the strong correlation between the Japanese yen and gold prices begins to break down.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is the updated long-term ratio between yen and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold</a>, which shows that the two have essentially acted as the same asset class as a net sum since 2011:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2531" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/b_LT.png" alt="Japanese Yen to Gold ratio" width="1040" height="618" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To see the 2016 high for gold in yen exceeded this week tells us that the 6-year correlation is beginning to weaken. It is the breaking of this correlation which will eventually help gold to assume its proper role as safe-haven of last resort.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will look for a major advance at gold prices worldwide to correspond with a breaking of the lower (blue) trend line of the Japanese yen/gold ratio, which should begin with gold breaking above </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¥151,000 per ounce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or a 3.5% further gain as priced in yen from last week’s close. This could occur within the next 2-3 weeks.</span>
<h3><b>North Korea Fires Missile Over Japan… Tests Hydrogen Bomb</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We never like to attribute one single cause to a market reaction. After all, the market is the sum of millions of distinct individuals, each acting upon their own unique beliefs, strengths, and fears. </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2532" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/c_NKorea.png" alt="c_NKorea" width="602" height="550" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, it is likely that a portion of the movement into gold by Japanese investors this week was due to fears over North Korea. The latter is noted to have – for the first time ever – launched a ballistic missile directly over Japan, which then landed east off the coast in the Pacific Ocean. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">North Korea is subsequently reported to have tested a hydrogen bomb on Sunday.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tensions are certainly high between the United States, North Korea, and Japan, and while gold price spikes due to isolated geopolitical tensions are typically short-lived, those which foreshadow lengthy periods of conflict tend to be important early-warning indicators for more sustained price advances to develop throughout time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is too early to say with any certainty how the current standoff between these nuclear powers will end, but by breaking above 2016 highs on the chart, gold priced in Japanese yen is signaling something important for those who would listen: the correlation between the two safe-havens is breaking… in favor of gold.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is unlikely that the 6-year tight correlation will end in one week, but initial hints that this is in progress are plainly visible on the charts. We will continue to monitor this development at regular intervals for the foreseeable future. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All asset correlations eventually change. When gold begins to advance in yen terms it signifies that the precious metal is picking up on new fundamentals, and set to be the safe-haven of last resort. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the upcoming week, we watch to see if gold can match its similar 2016 high in US dollar terms, which comes in at $1,378.   </span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - September, 6</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,340.90 (+0.14%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.04 (+0.44%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $1015.60 (+0.39%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $953.10 (-1.01%), Dow Jones index 21,817.36 (0.31% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After reaching the strong point last week, the US Dollar Index started this week on a weaker note. The US Dollar Index is weak in the early hours on Wednesday. The geopolitical tensions and concerns about the Trump Administration keep adding more concerns to the US Dollar Index. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders have a chance this week to move the index in reaction to North Korea’s nuclear weapons test over the weekend. Gold price is trading higher on Wednesday, supported by geopolitical tensions over North Korea and expectations that low inflation in the United States could delay another interest rate hike there. Among other precious metals: silver price is up today, platinum price is also trading higher, palladium price slightly dropped today.   </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2436.68 (+0.24%) and NASDAQ Index 6387.90 (+0.19%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21817.36 (+0.31%). </span>

Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today, as investors focused on escalating tensions between the West and North Korea and worries about a lack of progress on President Donald Trump’s pro-growth agenda.

U.S.stock analytics are focused on lingering concerns over North Korea, a “potentially catastrophic” Hurricane Irma and doubts about President Donald Trump’s business-friendly agenda. The clear concern about the escalating tensions between the U.S. and North Korea will keep adding a high risk in trading in recent weeks.

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markit services PMI, ISM nonmanufacturing Index.</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,342.40 (+0.29%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $18.03 (+0.66%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $1009.30 (+0.22%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $942.60 (+0.36%), Dow Jones index 21,784.64 (0.11% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index is trading lower today as investors reacted to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Central Bank’s monetary policy decision and ECB President Mario Draghi’s press conference. European Central Bank decided to leave interest rates unchanged.The ECB president M.Draghi said yesterday that no movement on interest rates is expected until the asset purchase program finishes and the ECB will get back to its decisions at the end of the year. Gold price stayed steady on Thursday, supported by a weaker dollar and concerns over North Korea. Among other precious metals: silver price is up, platinum and palladium prices are also higher.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2462.82 (-0.11%) and NASDAQ Index 6385.93 (-0.11%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 21784.64 (-0.11%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading lower today, as Congress faces a massive number of legislative deadlines and initiative launches in September. Full of unexpected issues like funding for the Hurricane Harvey recovery effort, September could be the most jam-packed month of the year. Hurricane Irma is now a Category 5 storm and could make landfall in Florida. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">President Trump’s administration reached a surprise deal with Democrats this week to raise the short-term US debt ceiling, reducing concerns over a potential government shutdown. However, the market is likely to continue focusing on geopolitical tensions and will start to shift focus to the Federal Reserve meeting later in September, looking for details on reducing the balance sheet.</span>

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekly jobless claims, Productivity, Unit Labor Costs.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Lessons from September 11 for Gold Prices</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a common warning given in the mainstream financial press that goes something like this: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do not buy gold during a geopolitical crisis because as soon as tensions fade the precious metal will give back all of its gains.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to look no further than recent articles available online to confirm this warning, such as this one published last week from CNBC:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2553" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/12-month-high-on-North-Korea-a_CNBC.png" alt="12 month high on North Korea a_CNBC" width="428" height="528" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the above warning accurate? Are the “experts” correct that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> should retrace if recent tensions with North Korea recede?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is: it depends on what timescale one is referring to. Yet by making a blanket statement and not quantifying the above warning with the proper perspective, this and similar articles risk misleading investors as a critical time period unfolds for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> over the next few years.  Let us examine a historical example.</span>
<h3><b>September 11</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Exactly 16 years ago today, let us rewind back to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to examine the price action in gold from a technical basis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">September 11 was a Tuesday, and on the day of the attacks, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins/gold-american-eagle/gold-eagles">gold</a> spiked in price from $273 per ounce to $290, a 6.2% gain. In today’s dollars, that would equate to an $84 intraday spike. The price action in the year leading up to the attack and in the months following is shown below:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2554" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2-pic.-b_911.png" alt="2 pic. b_911" width="955" height="714" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that after the September 11 surge, gold topped out over the following three weeks just below $300 per ounce. Moreover, in the two months that followed and as fears of an Armageddon scenario faded, gold did indeed give back all of its gains. Specifically, on November 24, gold closed below $272, which was the opening price from the morning of 9/11.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many who bought gold in the days following the attacks were surely frustrated to be sitting on losses within a few months, and those who did not put this price action into proper context likely sold and moved on to other asset classes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But even though gold did give back all of its short-term gains, was selling and moving on wise in hindsight?</span>
<h3><b>Increased Technical Perspective</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us back out the above chart for increased perspective to examine some of the technical trends that were in play at the time. Below we show gold from 1997 – 2002. The same 9/11 geopolitical price spike is again highlighted:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2560" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/c_9702.png" alt="c_9702" width="1102" height="825" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, gold had seen significant multi-year downtrend breaks leading up to the 9/11 price spike, shown above by the red callouts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A double-bottom was observed in April 2001, matching within a few dollars the July 1999 price of $252 per ounce.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, gold was showing several classic technical patterns indicating that a trend change from the prior years of falling prices was in the process of unfolding. The September 11 terrorist-related spike, while it was given back over the course of the following two months, was itself actually part of a longer basing formation for the precious metals in the early 2000’s.</span>
<h3><b>Longer-Term Perspective</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">How did the “isolated” September 11 price spike look when viewed within the context of the bull market which unfolded over the next 10 years? The following chart speaks for itself, where the spike can barely be seen amidst the more significant bottom that served as a launching pad for the next decade. </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2557" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pic-4-Geopolitical-price-d_LT.png" alt="pic 4 Geopolitical price d_LT" width="1075" height="804" />
<h3><b>Back to the Present</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tensions between the United States and North Korea continue to pick up in intensity. The gold price has spiked nearly $100 over the last six weeks. If tensions fade, will gold give back all of its gains?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, would selling in such a scenario be the proper decision?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Examine the gold price action since 2011, below. Note the now-ongoing five-year cup base formation that is nearing its later stages, following an important break of the 2011 – 2017 downtrend. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Does this chart not bear striking resemblance to the 1997 – 2002 chart, above, which also featured similar downtrend breaks amidst a multi-year cup basing formation?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You be the judge.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2556" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pic-3-Cup-Base-e_current-1.png" alt="pic 3 Cup Base e_current" width="1125" height="842" />
<h3><b>Takeaway on Geopolitical Events and Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold may indeed see a short-term retracement if tensions fade between the United States and North Korea (<a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/09/05/gold-breaks-2016-high-in-japan-us-to-follow/">Read our previous article</a>). Gold could give back $100 per ounce just as quickly as it gained it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the historic store of wealth is now five years into a clear basing process, one that is playing out irrespective of any short-term geopolitical price spikes. Multi-year bases are important setups for future market trends. The lessons from the 1997 – 2002 timeframe, which includes the spike seen on September 11, should be important for investors to keep in mind as they navigate what should be a volatile final quarter to 2017. Geopolitical tensions come and go, but the unemotional language of the charts contains a message all its own.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">On August 29, the US Mint issued its 2017</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-5-oz-silver-atb-new-jersey-ellis-island-statue-of-liberty"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellis Island National Monument 5-ounce silver bullion coins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Three days later, all 40,000 had been sold. No additional coins of this design will be produced. This is the fourth release of five in the</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/12/13/2017-stb-silver-quarter-designs/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">America the Beautiful Silver Coin Series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Still included in the inventory of the Philadelphia Mint is an undisclosed amount of 2016 Harpers Ferry National Park silver bullion coins. To date, 48,000 of these coins have been sold.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The next in the series will be released to authorized purchasers on November 13th. This coin, the 40th issue out of the 56 of the ATB Coin Series, commemorates the George Rogers National Historical Park. A nod to Indiana, this coin features one of the greatest victories of the American Revolution, led by Colonel George Rogers Clark.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus far this year, sales of</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2016/12/13/2017-stb-silver-quarter-designs/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">3-inch 5 ounce silver bullion coins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been decreasing, with 35,000</span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-5-oz-silver-atb-iowa-effigy-mounds-national-monument"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Effigy Mounds National Monument 5-ounce silver bullion coins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sold and only 20,000 of the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site and Ozark National Scenic Railway purchased.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales of the 2016 ATB releases numbered 105,000 for the Shawnee National Forest coin and 75,000 for the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park release.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index rose on Tuesday morning, climbing back from its deepest weekly drop. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, both storms and geopolitical tension were weighing down greenback, but the effect of storms appears to be more manageable than initially feared.

Looking ahead this week analysts will be focused on coming data this week, including consumer-price inflation, retail sales, industrial production, consumer sentiment and the Empire State manufacturing survey.

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>

Among other precious metals: silver price decreased, platinum price is also lower, palladium price is slightly higher.</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - September, 14</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,325.50 (+0.09%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.78 (-0.16%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $987.30 (+0.24%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $934.65 (-0.26%), Dow Jones index 22,147.76 (0.05% decrease)</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar Index is trading higher today supported by the economic data released yesterday, </span>including a stronger-than-expected rise in consumer price inflation for August. Even recent economic data may have been inspiring, and hopes for Thursday’s inflation data still relevant, but some strategists suggest don’t wait for a Dollar recovery yet. Gold price dropped to its lowest level again as the dollar moved ahead. The stronger greenback makes<span style="font-weight: 400;"> dollar-denominated gold more expensive for holders of other currencies. Among other precious metals: silver price is lower, platinum price is slightly higher, palladium price also dropped.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2491.72 (-0.26%) and NASDAQ Index 6425.62 (-0.55%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22147.76 (-0.05%). </span>

Wall Street indexes are trading mostly lower today following the strong data on jobless claims and inflation. Meanwhile, the latest data makes the expectations for a Fed hike in December seriously questionable. Inflation is a key economic factor the US central bank considers when deciding monetary policy.

Oil prices rose on Thursday after the International Energy Agency announced escalating faster than expected oil demand recently.

On the US political front, Donald Trump and top Democrats appear to agree to give a legal status to the children of illegal migrants but also haven't confirmed this fact so far.

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekly jobless claim, Consumer Price Index, Core CPI.</span>

		<title>CFTC files $290 Million Lawsuit against Monex a Precious metals dealer</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">On September 6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2017, the <a href="http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr7609-17">US Commodity Futures Trading Commission</a> (CFTC) accused a Newport Beach precious metals investment firm, Monex, of defrauding thousands of US customers with over $290 million by pulling off an illegal scheme of high-pressure sales tactics, leaving many senior clients without their life savings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to buying precious metals, it’s essential to do business with a trustworthy, reputable bullion dealer whose mission is to offer best prices, products, and services. Unfortunately, not all dealers provide secure and legal services and this recent CFTC law enforcement case highlights what to avoid when making precious metal investments.</span>
<h3><b>CFTC Lawsuit Against Monex</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal regulator filed the civil lawsuit against California’s Monex in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on Wednesday, September 6. In its complaint announcement-golded the alleged fraud “one of the largest precious metals” cases, it has ever filed since it involves over 12,000 accounts and holders and a time frame from July 2011 until March 2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">CFTC claims that Monex, owned by Louis and Michael Carabini (father and son) deceptively pitched leveraged trading through its so-called</span><a href="https://www.girardgibbs.com/monex-atlas-lawsuit/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlas trading platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in which the company profited while customer losses were all but inevitable – the complaint cited several cases of elderly clients who lost over $100,000 each.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission’s complaint focuses on off-exchange leveraged trades of silver, gold, platinum, and palladium performed by Monex clients using money borrowed through its Atlas platform. Although the alleged purpose of this trading platform was to allow retail customers to make investments by using the borrowed money, CFTC claims that Monex made most of its revenue by controlling the prices at which its clients bought and sold precious metals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The price difference (spread) between the underlying price on tracked spot markets and the price which Monex set was about 3%, which means, according to the cases cited in the complaint, it would cost the company’s clients $2,550 to trade 5,000 oz. of silver compared to a $25 cost to enter into a similar futures contract on a regulated exchange. Based on customers’ examples, CFTC alleged Monex for charging “outsized price spreads, commissions, interest on loans, and administrative fees.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, to boost its sales, Monex also deployed forceful TV campaigns and telephone sales which promised that its Atlas trading program was a secure and safe method of protecting customers’ wealth against inflation. Its employees involved in campaigns and sales were specially trained and used scripts that emphasized the investment’s “profit potential and security” – e.g. “If gold were to increase in value by $100 per ounce in the next year, and you had a 30% to 40% net gain, you’d feel pretty good, wouldn’t you?”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, over 90% of all leveraged Atlas accounts and customers lost big and Monex is believed to have intentionally hidden this information from its prospects. Besides, the commission alleged that Monex’s sales agents were paid bonuses and commissions based on the number of accounts which they opened and their transaction volumes, not by client’s earnings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">CFTC also accused the company’s owners, Louis Carabini (father) and Michael Carabini (son) of committing fraudulent activity and operating an illegal leveraged commodity platform which hasn’t been registered with the commission. The federal regulator also asked a judge to stop Monex from continuing to offer its Atlas platform trades to clients, seeking to have full restitution to harmed customers as well as disgorge any ill-gotten gains.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side, Monex issued a statement through which it denied any fraud allegations and stated that the terms of its Atlas trading program were publicly disclosed. The company also declared that it will vigorously defend the commission’s unwarranted action, disputing whether the federal regulator had any jurisdiction over the firm.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this is not the first time the Carabinis or Monex have faced legal troubles. In 2004, Monex faced a class-action lawsuit that alleged the company in misleading its clients, resulting in a $150,000 payment to class members, while in 1974, Louis Carabini was accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of obtaining $1 billion through deceptive sales of silver coins on margin.</span>
<h3><b>Always Perform Due Diligence</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Seemingly, there may be other similar precious metals companies or telemarketing firms which offer deceptive services or make forceful sales through home shopping TV shows. In most cases, they manage to convince the customers, mostly elderly clients, to make apparently a highly profitable investment while, in reality, ripping them off.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A previous eloquent and similar example is CFTC’s 2015 civil enforcement action filed against Andrew Kurzbard and its telemarketing company Guardian Asset Group, LLC which accused them of engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious metals transactions. The lawsuit ended with a consent order in May 2017 through which the now-defunct company and its owner were forced to pay restitution of $434,413.54 and a $651,620.31 civil monetary penalty and imposed them permanent trading and registration bans. Guardian and Kurzbard agreed to pay the civil penalty without denying or admitting the allegations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, choosing a reliable precious metal dealer is not easy, but it’s a critical decision either you already are an expert investor or just a new one. Luckily, the above lawsuits teach us about </span><b>key signs that warn us about a potential illegal bullion business</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-pressure sales and aggressive TV campaigns</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Precious metal trading based on in-house loans</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unclear and confusing shipping policies, terms and conditions etc.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expensive and ambiguous costs, fees, commissions etc.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unallocated precious metals storage</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partial ownership in form of “gold units” or “shares”</span></li>
</ul>

		<title>Daily Market Review - September, 15</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,326.20 (-0.12%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.79 (-0.39%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $980.20 (-0.44%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $923.60 (+0.26%), Dow Jones index 22,203.20 (0.12% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
US Dollar Index is trading lower today following Thursday’s economic data and the North Korea's another missile over Japan. North Korea fired the sixth ballistic missile since 2006 and the second one over Japanese island on Friday morning. Market analytics consider we could see further weakness later today if investors decide to aggressively dump higher-risk assets. Gold price also slipped on Friday, also weighted down by the North Korea’s latest missile launch over Japan and the strong inflation data. However, geopolitical risks can boost demand for safe-haven assets such as gold and the Japanese yen. Among other precious metals: silver price slightly dropped, platinum price is also down, palladium price increased.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stock market on Friday opened mixed S&amp;P 500 2495.62 (-0.01%) and NASDAQ Index 6428.62 (-0.02%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22203.20 (+0.12%). </span>

Wall Street indexes are trading mixed on Friday as investors looked at the last North Korea’s firing of another missile over Japan and analyzed yesterday economic data.

The missile flew over Japan before landing 2,000 km east of Hokkaido. After the North's latest launch, South Korea has responded by firing its own missile into the sea. President  Donald Trump announced that its time for China and Russia to take direct actions against the North Korea.

<b>Economic data for today: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retail sales, Empire state index, Industrial production, Consumer sentiment. </span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - September, 18</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,312.60 (-0.12%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.40 (-0.39%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $967.10 (-0.44%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $934.65 (+0.26%), Dow Jones index 22,326.97 (0.12% increase).</i></b>

Here is a new week ahead and it’s all about the two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which starts on Tuesday. The Fed will release a policy statement summary of economic projections and a press conference with Fed Chair Janet Yellen. Fed meeting has a lot of parts to discuss, but the main decision is about interest rates. Experts suggest that the Fed is not expected to change interest rates, but it is likely to announce that it will start letting the bonds held on its balance sheet. Other U.S. important economic data is mainly about the housing market, the leading economic indicators will be released on Thursday, and Flash PMI should be released on Friday.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
The US Dollar was little higher on Monday, recovered from the Friday’s losses caused by weak economic reports. The greenback dropped last week after the economic data showed that U.S. industrial and manufacturing production was lower in August. Gold price slipped today, weighed down by expectations ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting tomorrow. Gold price is highly sensitive to rising US interest rates, and the meeting’s results will be closely watched by traders. Among other precious metals: silver is slightly down, platinum decreased, and palladium price is trading higher.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2507.31 (+0.28%) and NASDAQ Index 6472.64(-0.02%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22326.97 (+0.12%). </span>

Wall Street indexes are trading higher today seemed to have recovered after the North Korea ‘s 6th missiles into the Pacific Ocean last week.

The two-day Fed Open Market Committee meeting, which begins on Tuesday, will be the most important news for markets as the US central bank is expected to announce its balance plans while keeping interest rates unchanged to "normalize" monetary policy.

As for international news, the Bank of England’s Mark Carney will be speaking on Monday, and British Prime Minister Theresa May will speak about Brexit on Friday. Meanwhile, escalating geopolitical tension between North Korea and the US will keep investor’s attention this week.

<b>Economic data for this week:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Home builders' index</span><b> (Monday), </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing starts, Building permits, Import Price Index</span><b> (Tuesday),</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Existing Home Sales, FOMC announcements, Janet Yellen Press conference </span><b>(Wednesday),</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Weekly jobless claims, Leading economic indicators </span><b>(Thursday), </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markit manufacturing</span><b> (Friday).</b>]]></content>

		<title>Perth Mint presents the new 2018 Marvel Comics “Thor” Silver Bullion Coin.</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">This October, the internationally renowned Australian refinery, Perth Mint, presents a new Marvel's legendary comic character and one of the most important and powerful God in Norse mythology - Thor. The iconic hero created as a very cool rendition of the comic book Thor, not the portrayal for the Marvel Comics Universe movie franchise played by Chris Hemsworth, but the classic original look. The new design pictures Thor in action while holding his hammer- Mjolnir. The son of Odin and Fyorgyn - the Earth goddess, Thor is considered as the storm-weather God of sky and thunder, who also can fly. With a new Marvel movie -Thor Ragnarok coming in November this super-iconic character couldn’t possibly be a better subject for a coin series right now.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Marvel movies, Thor Odinson is the prince of Asgard and a former member of Avengers; he was stripped of his power and banished by his father Odin to Earth. While being on Earth, Thor learned humanity and helped to save Asgard from his jealous adopted brother Loki. This is how he redeemed himself in the eyes of his father and was granted his power once again. After being welcomed back to Asgard as a hero, Thor joined the Avengers and fought with them against the Asgard enemies.    </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This amazing coin is the second release following the successful </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-1-oz-tuvalu-spiderman-silver-coin-bu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 1 oz Tuvalu Spiderman Marvel series silver coin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and takes this series to a whole other level, featuring the superhero team of the decade, The Avengers, from Marvel Comics.</span>

The reverse side depicts the iconic Marvel hero, Thor, holding his hammer and framed by the mintmark and the inscriptions “Thor” and “Marvel,” while the obverse carries the well-known effigy of Queen Elizabeth II, surrounded by the engravings of her name, mintage year, and the coin’s weight, purity, and denomination.</span>

		<title>The Fed is Caught</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Federal Reserve begins its once-per-six-weeks policy meeting on Tuesday, with a statement to be issued by Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Wednesday at 2 pm EST. Expect lower volatility across most markets on Tuesday and Wednesday prior to the announcement, with a spike in volatility immediately after 2 pm. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot know exactly what will be announced on Wednesday, but the charts are positioning themselves for an important low to form across the precious metals complex coming into the meeting. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The markets are pricing in a near-zero chance of an interest rate hike on Wednesday, with roughly a 50% chance for a hike at the last meeting of the year in December.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we show the current dot-plot for interest rate expectations by the 16 members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which gives a consensus estimate for what US short-term interest rates will average for each of the next two years and beyond.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2657" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Federal-reserve.png" alt="Federal reserve" width="521" height="405" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For 2018, the consensus average is 2.00% – 2.25%, which would necessitate four more quarter-point interest rate hikes from the current target of 1.00% - 1.25%. This is the general expectation of the FOMC, although it is always subject to change based on market conditions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there is expected to be no rate hike this Wednesday, the markets will be watching for a potentially more important source of information: language describing the Fed’s intentions to “normalize” its balance sheet going forward. That the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/06/19/fed-rate-hike-and-gold/">Fed is set to normalize its balance</a> sheet was first discussed at the policy meeting in June; however, we have received no tangible information as to how or when the Fed intends to engage in this normalization since.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a reminder, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> sold off strongly on the day that the Fed announced its balance sheet normalization intentions, at the June 14 meeting.</span>
<h3><b>“Normalization” – Say What?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Normalization is a euphemism used by central banks including the Fed: the term is used to describe the selling of bonds and other securities that the Fed has “purchased” since the credit crisis of 2007 – 2009.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall that these bonds – and </span><b>all assets the Fed ever buys – are purchased with freshly created electronic money. </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever the Fed mentions purchasing anything, it is universally talking about printing money and debasing the currency – in other words, creating inflation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is rarely mentioned in mainstream financial publications, as the reality of the situation would be too appalling to discuss in such a forthcoming manner.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, manipulating the prices of assets by purchasing them with newly-created money: this is the only tool that the Fed has ever had.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a reminder of the unprecedented nature of the Fed’s balance sheet, the following chart is reprinted courtesy the Wall Street Journal, which shows the Fed’s holdings from 2004 through the present:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2658" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Building-the-Fed-balance-sheet.png" alt="Building the Fed balance sheet" width="554" height="365" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important point to observe is this: </span><b>it took the Fed from its creation in 1913 through 2008 to accumulate (a.k.a. print) $1 trillion in assets, yet in just the last nine years alone it has printed over $3 trillion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as its balance sheet has grown from $1 trillion to over $4 trillion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second key to recall is that the bulk of the Fed’s purchases have gone toward US treasuries and US mortgages. Is it any wonder that long-term bond and mortgage rates are the lowest they have been since World War II?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fed has completely distorted the very fabric of the financial marketplace, and every piece of the system that sits on top of this distorted base stands to be affected if and when the Fed begins to normalize its balance sheet.</span>
<h3><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2660" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/c_interest.png" alt="c_interest" width="378" height="436" /><b>US Treasury – annual interest expense</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now consider that this near-record interest expense is accumulating when benchmark </span><b>10-year Treasury bonds are at their lowest rates</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in over two generations:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2661" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Long-term-govenrment-Bond-yeild.png" alt="Long term government Bond yield" width="1125" height="433" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, </span><b>the government is paying record high interest when rates are at their lowest in modern history.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Can we imagine if treasury rates simply doubled, back to longer-term averages near 5.0%? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such would mean that the US government’s interest expense would approach $1 trillion per year, assuming no further debt was added into the equation – and of course, new debt keeps being added to the pile each year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What if 10-year yields returned to 7.5%, as they averaged for nearly 25 years from 1970 – 1995?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We must remember, when the Fed states that it intends to normalize its balance sheet, it is saying that </span><b>it intends to sell its recently-purchased treasury bonds, and thus allow interest rates to rise</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Can the Fed realistically be expected to sell much of its balance sheet in the face of record US interest expense, and thus force the government to roll over its debt at higher and higher rates?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The practical answer is: no.</span>
<h3><b>Most Only Know Falling Rates</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us observe: anyone who has been investing in the western world since 1980 knows only falling interest rates as a macroeconomic backdrop. Assuming the average investor begins his or her career at age 22, this means that </span><b>anyone born after 1958 knows only that interest rates keep falling, year after year</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A reversal in 37-years of falling interest rates is what the Fed is proposing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe the Fed has backed itself into a corner, and it will have to renege on its normalization-speak. If it allows interest rates to rise significantly, the central bank will crush the funding mechanism of the US government. If it continues to suppress rates through newly-created money, it will begin to lose credibility as an independent and impartial body.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A loss of confidence in the very institution of central banking in the United States and likely spreading around the western world is the potential if the Fed is not careful.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such will not happen overnight, but the Fed is walking a tight line between its own credibility and the ability of the United States government to fund its operations.</span>
<h3><b>A Third Central Bank Failure?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us not forget: two central banks have already failed in the United States: the First Bank of the United States was dissolved in 1811, and the Second Bank of the United States did not receive a charter renewal in 1836.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Central banking was not present nor required in the United States during the great technological revolutions of the mid-1800’s through early 1900’s, including the implementation of the railroad, the light bulb, the telephone, radio, automobile, and air travel. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Could we be seeing the first warning signs that a third central bank has caught itself in an unsolvable situation and will follow a similar fate as the first two?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In an era of faltering faith in central-bank promises, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> stands to assume its historical function as the premier asset class of last resort – the only financial asset with no counterparty risk and which is nobody else’s liability. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The history books are not written, but the fundamental data points and the quandary the Fed faces are there in plain sight for all to see. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, we watch to observe how the Fed handles its intentions for normalizing its balance sheet at this Wednesday’s meeting, and through the remainder of this year.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
The US Dollar is trading lower against a basket of currencies on Friday, pulling back from a more than two-week peak as the Federal Reserve announced it might raise interest rates in December. Gold price a little rebounded from a four-week low on Friday supported by the weaker dollar. Meanwhile, the tension between the United States and North Korea still forces investors to seek out the safe-haven asset in gold. Among other precious metals: silver price slightly dropped, platinum price is also lower, palladium price increased.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened mixed S&amp;P 500 2500.15 (-0.16%) and NASDAQ Index 6422.69 (-0.26%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22340.23 (-0.09%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading lower today </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as geopolitical tensions returned to the forefront after North Korea threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean. US President Donald Trump ordered new sanctions against North Korea on Thursday and North Korea’s leader defiantly vowed to persist with its nuclear and missile programmes and said it would consider measures against the United States. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The enthusiasm that helped markets set records earlier has drained away after Fed meeting results announced this week.</span>

		<title>How to sell your diamond jewelry</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you need <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/sell-to-us/diamonds-nyc">to sell your diamond jewelry</a>-it is important to arm yourself with the necessary information before heading to your local jeweler or dealer. Doing the correct research can give you the confidence that you need to get a better price for your valuables.</span>
<h3><strong>Here are some tips to on how to sell your diamond jewelry:</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get a free appraisal from a good jeweler, a professional diamond buyer, or even a pawnbroker in order to give you some insight about what you have. Tell the appraiser the truth about your plans to sell,  so that they can provide you with the most realistic idea of the resale value. Getting free appraisals from two or three different stores will help you get a good idea of how valuable your diamond jewelry actually is.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approach this process without unrealistic expectations about your diamond jewelry. Keep in mind that dealers and jewelers are in this business to make a profit, and if they agree to purchase your jewelry then they, in turn, have to make a profit out of it.Having unrealistic expectations will only lead to disappointment.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Familiarize yourself with the relevant information needed to </span><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/sell-to-us">sell diamond jewelry</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The basic criteria that all dealers use to grade diamonds are the 4 Cs:</span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Color</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The value of a diamond is determined based on its color. The most valuable diamonds are those without color, as their reflective qualities are superior compared to colored diamonds.  The closer the diamond is towards the no color range, the higher its demand. The exceptions to this rule are pink and blue diamonds, which are far more valuable. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cut</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:   Little known fact: the shape of the diamond is different from the cut. Diamonds come in round, square, and oval shapes, among others.  The cut is the angle and the finish of the diamond, which determines the brilliance of the light reflecting abilities of the stone. Both shape and cut are very important for a valuable diamond. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Clarity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The stones will be measured for their flawlessness. There are two types of flaws a jeweler looks for in a diamond: imperfection and inclusion. Imperfections are scratches on the stone or if the stone is chipped. Inclusions would be an air bubble, other mineral content, or cracks within the diamond. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Carat</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This refers to the weight of the diamond. One carat is equal to 200 milligrams. Don’t confuse </span>karat<span style="font-weight: 400;"> with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">k</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arat. Carat is used to measure the weight of diamonds and other stones, whereas karat is used to measure the weight of precious metals like gold and silver.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best thing you can do is to obtain certification for your diamonds. One of the best certification institutes is the highly trusted GIA or Gemological Institute of America. They won’t be able to help you with a monetary estimate, but they can provide detailed information about the four Cs of your diamonds. With this certification on hand, you will be an educated seller, deterring sellers from quoting you a low price. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get your diamonds and jewelry cleaned professionally before you take them to a buyer.  Smudges and dirt can distract a potential buyer or make it difficult to determine the exact value.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Know your options for where to sell diamond jewelry<span style="font-weight: 400;">. You have many different options. You can take it to a dealer or a jeweler, or you can also sell it online on e-commerce sites such as eBay, or even opt for consignment shops. If you want fast cash, then a jeweler or a dealer is your best option. If you plan to </span>sell diamond jewelry<span style="font-weight: 400;"> online, there are greater risks and it may take time for you to learn how best to sell your products on the different platforms available. This choice is much simpler if you already have experience selling online. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Familiarize yourself with the second entity of your diamond jewelry, the metal that your diamond is bound in. You will need to know the type of metal, its weight, and its karat or purity before you sell it. You will also need to know if the piece is an antique, if it was created by a specific designer or brand, or if the design is particularly rare. If you know that your diamonds are high-quality diamonds devoid of any imperfections or inclusions then they are more valuable out of their settings, as it allows the potential buyer to examine the diamonds freely and you will get a better price. If your diamond has flaws or inclusions which the setting is hiding and the diamond looks better in the setting than it would otherwise,  leave them in place, which may fetch you a better bargain. </span></li>
</ul>

		<title>Gold is Testing Important Support</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the decline seen in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/">gold</a> prices over the past three weeks, let us update our technical roadmap for the international store of wealth.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the week as a sum, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> closed lower by 2.1% or nearly $28 to finish at $1,291 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the long-term gold chart below, it is critical to note that the precious metal is now coming back into the zone (green shading) to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the broken long-term 2011 – 2017 downtrend (magenta line). Oftentimes, markets will break out of an important technical boundary, only to reverse and revisit that same price zone several weeks or months later. This is what is now occurring in gold.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2732" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Gold-2008-Present.png" alt="Gold 2008-Present" width="1034" height="727" />
<h3><b>Why do Retests Occur?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Retests occur as short-term traders take profits following an important breakout.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a successful scenario, we expect a return to the breakout point to be bought aggressively by second-chance investors – those who missed the initial move, and who now scoop up gold when the market returns to the same price zone.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, in this case, gold broke its declining long-term downtrend at $1,265 back in mid-August. Because the trendline was downward sloping, if gold were to retest the technical breakout today it could fall all the way back to $1,250 without violating the line from the upper side. It is important to know that retests of technical trendlines may indeed occur at lower prices than their original breakout points.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who only view the price in isolation will be missing an important point: a trend change higher is unfolding on the long-term chart.</span>
<h3><b>Short-Term Support Levels</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold</a> could fall back to $1,250 as part of its trendline retest, our highest probability scenario is that it will not fall that low. Instead, we expect a low to form in the $1,283 - $1,301 region, shown below by the green callout.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2733" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Trump-Reversal-Resistance.png" alt="Trump Reversal Resistance" width="1000" height="749" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This expected low is derived from a confluence of important support levels identified in this range. In technical analysis, whenever we see a confluence of support levels within a narrow band, it represents a high probability target scenario. The specific levels are:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,301 – the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the entire July through September rally (light silver line).</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,300 – important horizontal resistance (black dashed line), which held prices lower for most of 2017, and was then decisively broken during the last week of August. When a level which formerly acted as resistance is finally broken, it should then serve as support the next time prices return there, as second-chance buyers look to enter positions, having missed the initial advance.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,283 – the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the entire July through September rally (light silver line).</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, we have three technical support levels within an $18 price region between $1,283 - $1,301, and this represents a high-probability zone for gold to bottom on the present retracement.</span>
<h3><b>Next Up: 2016 Highs</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The actual high two weeks ago was $1,362, and this figure is close enough to the July 2016 peak at $1,378 that we can call this most recent attempt a functional test of the 2016 resistance zone. The retracement that we are now seeing is expected to be the final drop before the next advance brings gold to fresh highs above 2016 levels.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We watch for lows to develop in the $1,283 - $1,301 range as an ideal short-term technical retracement. We encourage investors to use any price points for spot gold in the $1,200’s as final opportunities for accumulation in these ranges. New highs above 2016 levels should be in store for gold by the end of 2017 if prices continue to hold above the now-broken long-term downtrend on any retest.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">Silver</a> is lagging gold on a relative basis, and next week we will focus more in-depth on what to expect for gold’s cousin on the next move.</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - September, 26</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,302.50 (-0.20%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.05 (-0.76%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $943.30 (-0.26%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $916.55 (+0.52%), Dow Jones index 22,296.09 (0.24% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
The US Dollar Index is climbing on Tuesday ahead of several speeches from Fed officials. In general, US Dollar has made good progress in the recent two weeks. The greenback has gained points against the euro after the Germany’s election results this week. Experts consider the geopolitical situation and Fed new monetary policy, all together, should make an interesting time for the US Dollar. Gold price slipped lower on Tuesday as US Dollar is trading higher, but not too far as yellow metal dropped down last week. Among other precious metals: silver price slightly dropped, platinum price is also lower, palladium price increased.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Tuesday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2496.66 (-0.22%) and NASDAQ Index 6370.59 (-0.88%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22296.09 (0.24%). </span>

Wall Street Indexes are trading lower today after North Korea’s foreign minister remark about shooting down U.S. bombers even if they are not in North Korea’s airspace. Ri Yong-Ho said this in response to Donald Trump’s comments on Sunday about “the regime’s leaders won’t be around much longer”.

Despite the geopolitical news, investors are waiting for fresh readings on the housing market and consumer confidence, as well as speeches from Fed chief Janet Yellen and three other U.S. central bankers later this week.

		<title>Daily Market Review - September, 27</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,285.40 (-0.20%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.82 (-0.76%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $922.90 (-0.26%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $922.20 (+0.52%), Dow Jones index 22,284.32 (0.05% decrease).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">US Dollar jumped on Wednesday as investors look ahead to President Donald Trump’s announcement on tax reforms, which is expected to include plans to significantly cut taxes for both corporations and individuals. Investors expect to hear a list of actions rather than another “wish list” from Administration. Meanwhile, gold price dropped lower on Wednesday, weighed down by the stronger greenback and upcoming tax plan by Donald Trump’s administration. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold lost what it gained on North Korea tension after recent Fed’s monetary policy changes and last Yellen’s comments. Among other precious metals: silver price is slightly down, platinum price decreased, palladium price increased.  </span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Wednesday opened mixed S&amp;P 500 2496.84 (+0.01%) and NASDAQ Index 6380.16 (+0.15%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22284.32 (-0.05%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading mostly higher, as analysts said the market is slightly recovered after a four-session of trading lower.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">President Donald Trump’s tax reform, which should be unveiled today, may lower the corporate rate to 20 percent, the individual business rate to 25 percent, and cut the top individual income tax rate from 39.6 to 35 percent. Analysts consider that the worst scenario for markets: the current tax plan because any improvement would be a benefit for US markets. </span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,283.90 (-0.20%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.81 (-0.76%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $920.60 (-0.26%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $931.25 (+0.52%), Dow Jones index 22,357.32 (0.05% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
The Dollar Index continued to rise and jumped to its highest level over the month on Thursday, following by the new tax reform and the commentary from Federal Reserve speakers.Gold price fell today below $1290 level. Analysts consider this is a very negative move caused by the combination of the geopolitical factors and changes in internal US policy. Among other precious metals: silver price is slightly lower,  meanwhile palladium price increased significantly, and platinum price dropped to 9-week lows, trading lower than palladium first time in 16 years.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2505.50 (-0.07%) and NASDAQ Index 6436.47 (-0.26%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22357.32 (+0.07%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading lower today as excitement over a new tax reform was weighed down by the weak economic data. Jobless claims rose in the latest week, although this spike was explained by Irma and Harvey, two recent hurricanes that devastated Florida and Texas.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A few of Fed speakers’ announcements will keep investors’ attention later today, while the main market’s attention captured by questions on how the new U.S. President Donald Trump tax plan will be put in place. </span>

		<title>Increasing Palladium Prices: What’s Going On?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a surprising turn of events, over the past two days, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price">palladium</a> has increased in price to the point of surpassing its more popular brother metal, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price">platinum</a>. 2017 has seen a steady surge in the price of palladium, and this month has pushed it higher than the price of platinum for the first time since January of 2001.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few factors that could be attributed to this climb. Palladium’s biggest customer is the automobile industry, an industry that makes up 80% of its demand. Carmakers use palladium in the making of catalytic converters for gasoline-powered and hybrid-electric vehicles, while platinum is used for diesel-powered vehicles. As consumers move more towards environmentally friendly vehicles, these hybrid cars are rising in demand as diesel vehicles falter. The scandal last year in Europe, where carmakers were found to be falsifying the emissions tests for their diesel vehicles, has further contributed to the decreasing demand for diesel-powered automobiles.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This price parity could also be due to palladium’s largest producer, South Africa, whose currency (the rand) has seen a strong few years. As the rand strengthens, South Africa’s exports increase in price and this filters into a rising cost for this precious metal. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly enough, 2017 is the first year when the US Mint has ever issued <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-1-oz-palladium-american-eagle-coin">American Palladium Eagle</a>, and this fact may also affect the increasing price of palladium. Following the Act passed by Congress in 2010 to create this coin, a third-party study commissioned by the Treasury Secretary was conducted to determine the demand it could generate. One finding of this study was concern about the unpredictability of the palladium market at the time, as it was relatively new on the scene and could be slotted into the industrial metals trade as opposed to precious metals. Ultimately, the enthusiasm of numismatists kept its release on track. Coincidentally or not, the Palladium Eagle has been released this year as the newest edition of one of the most popular coin series in the world, the American Eagle series. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, platinum hit its lowest spot price in 16 years, with the price of one ounce of platinum buying .9901 ounces of palladium. Palladium was available on Wednesday for $919.50 an ounce, with platinum down to $917.49 an ounce. Thus far this year, palladium has increased 35% in price, with platinum at only a 2% increase at this point in 2017.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Daily Market Review - September, 29</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,289.00 (+0.07%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.87 (-0.35%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $922.80 (-0.56%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $937.50 (+0.40%), Dow Jones index 22,381.20 (0.18% increase).</i></b>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar is trading higher on Friday and gaining more than 1.2 % against a basket of major currencies this week. Analysts examine the greenback has had a relatively strong September after long summer months of declines.Supported by a  sharp rise in interest rates and ideas of tax reform, the US Dollar is closing one of its best month of the year. Gold price held steady just above the previous session’s six-week low. This week Gold prices witnessed major volatility, at the beginning of the week the prices were up by almost 2 percent due to ongoing tension between North Korea and the USA, but last few days turned negative for yellow metal after Fed Chairman speech and new tax reform. Among other precious metals: silver price decreased, platinum price is also slightly lower, palladium price keep climbing up. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday is the last trading day of this month and of the quarter, which makes it an extra special day for the precious metals charting perspective.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2510.06 (+0.12%) and NASDAQ Index 6453.45 (+0.19%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22381.20 (+0.18%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street indexes are trading higher today, with investors finding few reasons to keep pushing indexes higher following gains that have lifted for both the month and the quarter. This week was marked by comments from Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen and the long-awaited announcements on tax reform from the Trump administration.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest economic data was also promising: personal income rose 0.2 % in August, while consumer spending was up 0.1 %.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no much news and expectations for today: Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker has scheduled speech today at 11 am, covering the economic outlook. </span>

<b>Economic data for today:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Personal income, Consumer  spending, Consumer sentiment</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - October, 2</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> decreased to $1,277.50 (-0.20%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.72 (-0.76%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $915.50 (-0.26%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $926.30 (-0.52%), Dow Jones index 22,470.66 (0.29% increase).</i></b>

This week has plenty economic data, but most strategists are focused on what’s happening at the Federal Reserve as well as U.S and global political risks than any single data point. Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks Wednesday. That’s also the day the Senate will release a budget plan. The week’s economic calendar includes reports on the manufacturing and services industry early in the week and the ends with the September non-farm employment report on Friday. The sharp moves for US stocks occurred because of a mass shooting in Las Vegas that is being described as one of the worst in U.S. history.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar is trading higher against the major currencies as Fed rate hike continues to build. Analysts suggest the Euro is underperforming at the start of a new week because the political risks in Europe have not gone away. Gold price slipped on Monday as the greenback rose and growing expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate hike also adds the pressure. The yellow metal has its biggest monthly decline so far and there is nothing really to boost the gold price now. Among other precious metals: silver price is slightly lower, platinum and palladium prices decreased.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2526.67 (+0.29%) and NASDAQ Index 6524.77 (+0.45%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22470.66 (+0.29%). </span>

Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today as investors wait to hear from President Donald Trump comments about the prospect of talks with North Korea and boosted by the latest news of shooting in Las Vegas. With less than an hour to go before the markets open all indexes just jumped.

On the data front, there will be manufacturing PMI figures for September and manufacturing data out, which both reports may affect the market as well as the employment report later this week.

<b>Economic data for this week: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markit manufacturing PMI, ISM manufacturing index </span><b>(Monday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Motor vehicle sales </span><b>(Tuesday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Markit services PMI, ISM nonmanufacturing Index </span><b>(Wednesday),</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Weekly Jobless claim, Trade deficit </span><b>(Thursday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Nonfarm payrolls, Unemployment rate, Average Hourly Earnings, Consumer Credit (</span><b>Friday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Silver Lagging Gold – Cause for Concern?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have not had a good look at <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> in several months, so let us take the opportunity this week to do so.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the stats: for the week ended Friday, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> fell by 1.8% or $0.31 cents, to close at $16.68 as of the final tick for the December futures contract on the New York COMEX. It was the third weekly loss for silver in a row, matching the streak for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a>. Silver is down some 8.8% or $1.62 from the recent high of $18.30 in September.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What should we expect going forward? Let us turn to the charts:</span>
<h3><b>Silver Short-Term</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2793" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Flash-Crash-1.png" alt="" width="570" height="515" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If silver continues to falter over the short run, we see minor support near $16.30, at the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the advance starting with the July flash crash lows through the recent peak at $18.30. More important support begins at $16.10 (labeled Initial Support above in black), a level which has held prices higher on five occasions since May 2016. We expect this support zone will hold as <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> now retests its long-term downtrend.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As silver moves higher, significant resistance will still be seen in the region between $18.30 - $19.00, an area representing at least five pivot highs since October 2016. All things considered, we expect sellers to emerge in this region again. This is labeled Primary Resistance on the chart above.</span>
<h3><b>Silver Lagging Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver has been lagging gold since the 2016 peaks for both metals at $21.25 and $1,378, respectively. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In stating this, we are referring to the fact that as of September 2017, gold has come to within 1.2% of its 2016 high at $1,362, while silver has only come to within 14% of its relative 2016 high at $18.30.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, in September silver made a lower high at $18.30 than either of its previous 2017 peaks, both of which just touched $18.50. Meanwhile, gold clearly exceeded its 2017 previous high of $1,295 in September. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Referring back to last week’s article, we continue to expect that gold will exceed its 2016 high on the next rally, either late this year or early 2018. However, our model shows that silver will continue to lag, and not exceed 2016 highs at the same juncture as gold. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Should this lagging be a concern for silver investors?</span>
<h3><b>Silver Underperformance in Perspective</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A common fallacy in the precious metals world is that silver must “confirm” every move in gold, or else the advance in gold is suspect or doomed to failure. We are not sure where this idea originated from, but it is absolutely false when we study the relative performance of both metals at key junctures throughout history.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us consider an example from the past that shares similar technical “basing” characteristics to the current time period for both metals.</span>
<h3><b>2000 – 2004 in Gold and Silver</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver lagged gold notably during the 2000 – 2003 timeframe, as we can observe from the following chart:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2785" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gold-2000-2003.png" alt="Gold 2000-2003" width="537" height="472" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After lengthy bear markets were nearing their terminal stages at the turn of the millennium, notice how gold began to turn upward and finally eclipsed its February 2000 peak at $323 per ounce by December 2002. Meanwhile, silver lagged gold for all of its advance. For example, silver remained well below its related 2000 peak at $5.60 even in December 2002, only reaching $4.85.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Was this underperformance by silver a reason to discount gold’s advance? Or was silver’s lag effect actually an opportunity in disguise for investors who were following the broader market context?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us advance the chart above by one additional year:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2786" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Silver-2011-2017.png" alt="Silver 2011-2017" width="537" height="473" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite lagging for most of the 1999 – 2002 timeframe, silver began to play catch up to gold in early 2003. In fact, silver rose over 90% from the point where our first chart ended in February 2003 through the April 2004 high. During this time, gold advanced only 17%.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors should be aware: most of the “work” in silver investing comes during the waiting. Silver can lag gold for weeks, months, or even years. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when silver does finally begin to catch up, it often does so rapidly and with little warning. The payoff tends to be worth the wait, even if it is frustrating to those with short time horizons.</span>
<h3><b>Expectations for Silver</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite lagging gold recently and our expectation that it may lag for some months further, silver remains in a healthy basing pattern on the long-term chart. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver’s long-term base will eventually be seen to be all price action underneath the key $25/oz level. We expect silver will continue to trade from the mid-teens through the low twenties per ounce for the next 12-24 months, even as gold looks to start a more significant advance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During this basing period, metal will be quietly transferred from weak hands to strong.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the basing process completes and silver breaks $25, an entirely new trajectory will begin. But this is likely still 2-3 years into the future.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2794" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Silver.png" alt="" width="566" height="510" />
<h3><b>Takeaway on Silver</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver will play catch up to gold when many least expect it. For now, let us not fall into the trap of assuming that silver underperformance means moves in both metals are suspect. History shows that gold leading silver indicates an early-stage of an emerging advance, not a doomed market.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,281.90 (+0.20%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $16.97 (+0.76%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $919.70 (+0.26%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $927.55 (+0.52%), Dow Jones index 22,773.67 (0.01% decrease).</i></b>

Here is a new week ahead, starting with Columbus Day, which means nothing is happening on Monday. The government shut downs for the day, bond markets are closed, only the  U.S. stock markets are open for trade on Monday. This week, the Fed releases the minutes of the September meeting, and it will give investors a better picture of how the central bank will execute its plan. For the rest of the week, there are some economic data, that could make some changes in market volatility. The biggest report comes on Friday when the government will release the Consumer Price Index.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar moved higher on Monday as traders consider the increased chances of one more interest rate hike in December and also increased optimism about tax reform plans. Gold price gained some points on Monday, as North Korea-USA tension got a new flare-up. Over the weekend President Trump said that White House has talked to North Korea many times without success and now it seems only one thing will work. This announcement left many Americans to think what would be his next step and is there any military actions behind this. Among other precious metals: silver price increased, platinum and palladium prices are also trading higher.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2549.33 (-0.11%) and NASDAQ Index 6590.18 (+0.07%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 22470.66 (-0.01%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes opened mixed today, while bond markets are closed in observance of Columbus Day. Investors were analyzing comments sent by U.S. President  Trump over the weekend. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those comments triggered concern that the U.S.-North Korea standoff could be about to enter a new phase.</span>

		<title>Gold and a Falling Gold/Silver Ratio</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold has fallen further over the past week from the correction zone between $1,283 - $1,301 which would have constituted an ideal 38.2% - 50.0% Fibonacci retracement of the July through September advance. However, as discussed in the <a href="http://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/09/25/gold-is-testing-important-support/">gold update</a> two weeks ago, the precious metal could fall all the way back down to $1,240 at this juncture without violating the technical model. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The message of the market remains: <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> is retesting the breakout from it's long-term 2011 – 2017 trendline, shown below in the magenta color. The retest zone is now highlighted in green for greater clarity on the intermediate-term chart:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2816" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/a_gold.png" alt="a_gold" width="1061" height="794" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the week as a sum, gold fell nearly $10 or 0.8%, to close at $1,275 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX for the December futures contract.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> bucked the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> trend and finished higher for the week by $0.11 cents or 0.7% to close at $16.79. This represents a falling in the gold to silver ratio (the number of ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold) over the short term.</span>
<h3><b>Lessons from a Falling Gold to Silver Ratio</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The notable action in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a> versus gold last week warrants an updated look at this important ratio. (For the chart below, we must switch over to the trading desk because it allows us to view intraday price data, as opposed to COMEX-only price data, as with our usual provider.)</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2817" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/b_ratio.png" alt="b_ratio" width="1108" height="757" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The important points to recall regarding the gold to silver ratio from 2011 through the present:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2011 – 2016 rising channel in the ratio generally corresponded with falling precious metals prices, as gold held its value better on a relative basis. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major 2016 surges in both gold and silver occurred amidst the ratio breaking lower through the rising channel in April 2016, falling from 84 down to 64 ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold by July 2016.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since July 2016, as both metals have corrected in price, the gold to silver ratio has been in a general rising trend again.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the depth of silver’s Flash Crash in July, the ratio peaked at 85, just touching the lower broken boundary of the 2011 – 2016 channel. </span>This was a retest of the broken channel, labeled on the chart, and it represented a spike high – a level which was quickly rejected by the market.</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, the 2011 – 2016 rising channel was decisively broken during 2016’s metals surge. </span><b>This was an important signal of a long-term trend change, of which we are still in the early stages.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect the next major surge in both metals prices to occur when the gold to silver ratio breaks lower from its secondary rising trendline, which is shown on the chart above beginning in July 2016. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, this level would come in at 70 ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Precious Metals Prices This Week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If indeed the low for the present retracement has been seen as of Friday with gold touching $1,260 and silver briefly dipping to $16.30, gold will have made a correction that falls still within the valid retest zone of it's long-term 2011 – 2017 downtrend.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The outperformance of silver on Friday is an early positive sign for the sector as a whole.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We continue to expect gold will eclipse its 2016 high of $1,378 on the next primary wave higher, while silver may lag on a relative basis with respect to the time required to break its own high of $21.25. Any such lag in silver should be looked at as an opportunity.</span>

Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today, as investors consider that another rate increase this year likely to be warranted. If traders are not worried too much about the Fed’s policy, there is also North Korea and geopolitical tension that support the prices.

Bitcoin hits a new record high above $5,200 today, with rising interest causing a rally for the price of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is now up around 424 percent year-to-date. Traders think that three major factors that have contributed to the recent price surge of Bitcoin: the hard fork in November, the introduction of the national licensing program for cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan, and the rise in demand for Bitcoin in the US market by institutional investors.

		<title>Bitcoin Hits All-Time High</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday saw an all-time high for bitcoin, setting a new record at $5316.86 at the time of writing. This year has seen regular growth for this form of cryptocurrency, with the previous all-time high hitting on September 2nd, at $5231.28. As of today, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/06/02/why-is-bitcoin-going-up/">bitcoin</a> has shown a 424% increase for 2017 to date and a 750% increase in the past year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin started the year at $966 and is now worth more than four times the price of an ounce of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a>. This record growth is attributed to the increase of interest shown by investors in cryptocurrency, whose total market cap has risen higher than $160 billion for the first time since early September.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">China’s banning of exchanges with cryptocurrency in September has caused caution for some, but most investors do not appear to be concerned. There have been new reports released this week stating that bitcoin trading in China may resume with stricter regulations. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Russia is also working on regulation of the use of cryptocurrency, with President Vladimir Putin warning of “serious risks”. He tempered his warning with a refusal to throw up “too many barriers”, which may have helped bitcoin reach its high today. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with the calls for regulation, cryptocurrency is gaining traction as a common currency, with even some property developers in London accepting rent payments from tenants through bitcoin. The Japanese government announced on September 29 that it was implementing regulations that would recognize bitcoin as an accepted payment method. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Differing predictions come from economists, with some warning of a price bubble. Harvard professor of economics and public policy Kenneth Rogoff stated that while he predicts that cryptocurrency and its technology will continue to grow, the bitcoin itself could collapse.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This high was not unexpected, as the growth of bitcoin has been at more than $4800 this week, but marks a major achievement.</span>]]></content>

Here is a new week ahead, packed with a lot of economic readings in the US and key economic releases from across the globe. On the political stage - President Trump’s decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal will add to global concerns, along with the ongoing threats from North Korea. Global news: European leaders will meet this week to discuss Brexit. Meanwhile, Spain’s constitutional crisis is also not over yet.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
US Dollar is trading higher today, recovering after Friday lost as financial stability was weighted down by President Trump’s updated Iran policy. The last week unfolded some new views that the Federal Reserve will adopt a measured approach to its pace of monetary-policy normalization. Gold price significantly decreased today buoyed by worries over Iran and by rising dollar. Among other precious metals: all major metals prices dropped today.

Wall Street indexes rose to a three-year high today. Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Sunday reaffirmed the U.S. central bank's commitment to raising rates, even after the disappointing inflation data.

All the market focus is on Senior Trump administration officials comments that the United States was committed remaining part of the Iran nuclear accord for now.

		<title>Gold: Record-Breaking Volume as Base Nears Resolution</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have maintained a target of $1,485 - $1,535 per ounce for <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> by the end of 2018 for several months now. This target is based on a measurement of three technical levels which all occur within this $50 swath. As a reminder for new readers of this column, the three target levels we are referring to are:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consolidation from December 2015 through August 2017 featured an amplitude of $330 per ounce, from the low of $1,045 to the high of $1,375. This consolidation took place in the form of a giant triangle on the charts. In technical analysis when a triangle-consolidation break, the target is derived from an equal measurement of the amplitude ($330), added onto the apex of the triangle ($1,205). This calculation gave a target of $1,535. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is clear horizontal resistance visible on the long-term <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> chart at $1,525 (black line). This level formerly acted as support on three occasions in 2011 – 2013 and then failed on the fourth attempt in early 2013. Generally, strong former support levels will subsequently act as intermediate-term resistance on the next attempt to overcome them, as those who previously purchased gold at these higher levels will choose to exit the market at break-even.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire 2011 – 2015 gold decline comes in at $1,485. Fibonacci levels are derived from a pattern which exists in many aspects of nature (such as seashells, hurricanes, and the spirals of the galaxies) called the Fibonacci sequence. Financial markets often follow these similar patterns, the markets being a component of (human) nature.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, when we have a strong confluence of resistance levels within a tight range, this represents a high probability zone for the next target. </span><b>For gold this comes between $1,485 - $1,535.</b>
<h3><b>Record-Breaking Volume a Clue</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, we see clear signs that gold is gaining strength over the short run. As discussed in past articles, gold has already broken it's long-term 2011 – 2017 downtrend. What more, trading volume is picking up, to the extent that Q3 2017 (just closed on September 30) featured </span><b>the highest quarterly volume of gold contracts traded of all time: </b>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2848" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gold-2011-Present.png" alt="Gold 2011-Present" width="566" height="423" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, we can see that this volume surge is occurring still as prices remain at or below 2013 levels. It is often said in a technical analysis that “volume precedes price movement”. These volume spikes are happening now, during the final period of what is still a 5-year basing process (overall flat prices since 2013). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What is shown in these volume spikes is an acceleration in the transfer of gold from weak hands to strong hands, as this base nears its terminal stages?</span>
<h3><b>The Nature of Gold’s Base</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The question surrounding gold’s target remains the timing – and for this we must evaluate the developing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shape</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the ongoing 5-year basing pattern:</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2849" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gold-Quarterly-Price.png" alt="Gold Quarterly Price" width="559" height="331" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we can see from the chart, gold’s 5-year basing pattern continues to fit the profile of an early-stage parabolic growth curve, in colloquial terms resembling the “cup” profile (blue). </span><b>The lower range of the early parabolic curve has just been tested with gold’s low price of $1,262 from two Friday’s ago.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Note the blue-callout which points to this location of gold’s recent test of the parabolic curve.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If gold can maintain its early-stage parabolic base pattern (green arrows, above) throughout the remainder of 2017, it argues that our $1,485 - $1,535 target will be reached sooner rather than later, likely by Q2 2018. This may seem improbable for the casual observer of the metals markets, as we have not seen prices that high since early-2013, but it is indeed what is expected given an early-stage parabolic curve which remains unbroken. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If gold fails to maintain this parabolic base (red arrows, above), nothing changes about the target of $1,485 - $1,535. It is only the timing that will change – such will be pushed out toward the end of 2018, possibly to extend into Q1 2019. In sum, in this scenario, more consolidation will need to occur between the recent low of $1,262 and the 2016 peak ($1,378), before gold is ready to advance.</span>
<h3><b>Takeaway on Gold</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Record-breaking volume is being witnessed coming into the gold market. This is occurring amidst a period of five years in which prices have moved generally sideways as a net sum. The message here is of a market that is picking up interest and nearing the later stages of its basing process.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The remainder of the price action in 2017 will give us strong clues as to how soon our stated target zone will be reached. A continuation of an initial parabolic curve will bring a quicker target, while a breaking of this curve will result in a lengthier consolidation prior to the targets being reached.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us keep our eyes on gold carefully over the next three months.</span>

Gold price moved back today even on the celebration of five days long </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indian festival season. The yellow metal is trading lower</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to negative global cues: North Korea situation, the tension between the US and Turkey,  and ongoing uncertainty in Europe.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street indexes are trading mixed today, but the next few weeks in the U.S. stock market may be more challenging as companies begin reporting third-quarter results. The market could move quickly, so traders are getting ready. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors are also worried about the uncertainty surrounding the future trading relationship between the U.K. and EU after Brexit talks didn’t bring any outcome last week.</span>

		<title>A Galaxy Far, Far Away- New Star Wars Stormtrooper Coin</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest of the unmatched <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/coins/world-silver-coins/oceania/new-zealand/niue-star-wars">Star Wars Bullion series</a> has just been announced. Released by the New Zealand Mint, these coins feature officially licensed images of popular characters from the Star Wars movie series. Star Wars is one of the top movie franchises of all time, setting its iconic storyline in “a galaxy far, far away.” The New Zealand Mint began this series of coins in 2011, beginning a line of incredible gold and silver coins, and has announced that its latest release will commemorate the Stormtrooper character. </span>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>A Galaxy Far, Far Away</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Created by George Lucas, this incredibly popular franchise kicked off with its first movie release in 1977. As of 2015, the approximate value of this series was at $42 billion, setting it as the second highest-grossing media franchise of all time. Indeed, it has played an iconic role in popular culture, having launched a boom of science fiction releases in the 1970s and 80s, and has been preserved in the US National Film Registry for its cultural significance. Phrases from this film are often used in colloquial language, specifically “may the Force be with you” which triggered an unofficial holiday, May 4th, as “Star Wars Day”. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stormtroopers are the police force for the Galactic Empire, the backbone of the Imperial Military and the forces that are sent out to stop the Rebel Alliance. Easily identified by their white armor worn over black body gloves, they carry blasters and laser rifles in the films.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Stormtrooper characters underwent a lot of development throughout the film series. In the films that were first released, they had non-identifying personalities, remaining staunchly loyal to the Empire and unremorsefully evil. As the series progressed, the audience learned that during the Clone Wars, they were simply military members who had not yet been absorbed by the Empire and had no real human component to their character, they were simply machines in a human form. In one of the Clone War films, they actually fought for the Jedi, but in a way that didn’t really place them on the good side, instead, they simply acted as a weapon that had been placed in the hands of the Jedi forces. In the more recent releases, we have been able to see a different side altogether of these mostly faceless characters underneath their bucket-shaped helmets, introducing us to Stormtrooper Finn, who actually defects from the Dark Side and leaves the Stormtrooper order behind to join the Rebel forces.</span>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>Available in Gold or Silver</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These coins are available in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2018-1-oz-niue-gold-star-wars-stormtrooper-coin">gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2018-1-oz-niue-silver-star-wars-stormtrooper-coin">silver</a> options. Both weighing in at one troy ounce and with a limited mintage of only 250,000 for silver and 25,000 for gold, these coins will be available for purchase in the beginning of November this year. With a $2 denomination for silver and $250 denomination for gold, these coins can be bought individually or in multiples.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2873" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/silver-and-gold.jpg" alt="silver and gold" width="805" height="450" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he reverse side of these coins showcases an officially licensed, close-up image of a Stormtrooper, armed with his blaster. The satin matt background carries the Imperial symbol and is engraved with the weight and quality of the coin, along with the official logo of the New Zealand Mint and the Lucasfilm copyright stamp. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The obverse carries the portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, designed by Ian Rank-Broadley, encircled by the inscriptions “Elizabeth II”, “Two Dollars”, “Niue”, and the year of mintage, 2018.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bullion Exchanges ensures a pleasant, and secure retail and online shopping experience. You can purchase the new </span>2018 1 oz Niue Star Wars Stormtrooper today <span style="font-weight: 400;">by phone at 800.852.6884 or online at our website. </span>]]></content>

		<title>Updated Spring 2018 Product Release Schedule from US Mint</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann Bailey, the Products Manager at United States Mint, presented the schedule for future product releases, which is now available on the US Mint’s official website. This presentation occurred during the United States Mint Forum in Washington D.C., with Bailey speaking as the Numismatic Program Manager. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The following is a compilation of the upcoming release dates that were included in this presentation:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At noon on January 4th the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2018-1-oz-silver-american-eagle-bu">2018 American Silver Eagle 1 oz coin</a> in Proof from West Point will be available for purchase. If you are a bulk purchaser, you have the opportunity to take part in the new bulk pack program that was begun last year. Through this option, you will receive five trays of 42 Eagles in a special box, available on the same day as its release. This bulk option was very successful last year, and the Mint has announced that this option could be made available for the Burnished Proof or San Francisco Silver Eagle in the future.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven days after this release, on January 11th, the Birth, Congratulations, and Happy Birthday Sets will come available. The Kennedy half dollar, Jefferson nickel, Roosevelt dime and Lincoln cent are included in the Birth and Happy Birthday sets in Proof version, bearing the S mint mark to denote the San Francisco mint. The Birth Set will also include the PIctured Rocks National Lakeshore quarter from Michigan, part of the America the Beautiful series, whose release will kick off the year for the series. The Happy Birthday set, contrastingly, will include the Rhode Island release which will conclude the series for 2018, the Block Island National Wildlife Refuge quarter from Rhode Island. A 2018-S Proof 1 oz Silver Eagle will come in the Congratulations Set. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The following Wednesday, on January 17, the first commemorative coin of 2018 will be released: the World War I Veterans Centennial Uncirculated Silver Dollar. This coin will be available in Proof and Uncirculated options. Five additional coin and medal sets will be available for purchase on the same day, each representing a branch of the US Military that served during World War I: the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Marines, and the Air Service Corps. The US Treasury stipulated that these medals could only be created to increase the sale of their coin counterparts, meaning that in order to purchase the entire set you will have to buy at least five World War I Veterans Centennial commemoratives. However, because the medals were struck with the same planchets and showcase exquisite designs, they will add value to any collection.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">January 23rd marks the release of the 2018 <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/coins/us-silver-coins/america-the-beautiful">America the Beautiful</a> Proof Set, which will include the San Francisco minted Proofs of 2018’s America the Beautiful quarter series: Michigan/Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, Wisconsin/Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, Minnesota/Voyageurs National Park, Georgia/Cumberland Island National Seashore, and the fifth and final release of the year, Rhode Island/Block Island National Wildlife Refuge.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">February will see the release of the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-w-1-oz-platinum-american-eagle-proof-coin-w-box-coa">American Platinum Eagle</a>, whose theme of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness stems from the Declaration of Independence. This three-coin series will break the mold of the previous 20 years’ worth of releases for its changing obverse designs that will share the same reverse eagle design. The 2018 release will showcase Lady Liberty on its obverse, her arms wrapped around a girl that is assumed to be her daughter. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On February 8th the one-tenth ounce American Liberty gold Proof Coin will be released, with the same design as the 2017 gold release of this coin. This fractional version is available by popular demand, due to the high price of gold affecting the sale of the 2017 release.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Thorpe, the renowned Olympic football player, was the first Native American to win a gold medal in the Olympics. His achievements will be celebrated in the 2018 Native American $1 coin, available in rolls and bags on February 15th, with the Pictured Rocks quarter three-coin set available for purchase five days later. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">February 22nd marks the release of the 2018 America the Beautiful 90% Silver Proof Set.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">March will kick off with the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2018-1-oz-gold-american-eagle-50-coin-bu">2018 American Gold Eagle</a> line, and one ounce, half-ounce, quarter-ounce, and tenth-ounce Proof coins will be sold beginning on the first. The American Gold Eagle four-coin set will additionally be released on the first. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Struck at the San Francisco Mint, the 2018 US Mint Proof Set will be released on the sixth of March. This set will include 2018’s five America the Beautiful Quarters in Proof, along with the Kennedy half-dollar, the Roosevelt dime, the Jefferson nickel, and the Lincoln cent, all of which are also in Proof versions. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The second commemorative release of 2018 will come out on March 15th, the 2018 Breast Cancer Awareness commemorative, which will include $5 22-karat pink gold coin, silver $1 coins, and clad half-dollars, available in Proof and Uncirculated, making a total of six coins in this set.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Five days later, on March 20th, 200-coin bags of the 2018 Kennedy half dollar and two-roll sets will be released. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2018 America the Beautiful Uncirculated Set will be released on March 29th, capping off the spring releases announced thus far.</span>
<h3><b>To Be Announced</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A tentative schedule is available on the website for the rest of the 2018 releases from the US Mint. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2018 American Buffalo one-ounce gold Proof coin will come out in spring, along with the Uncirculated 2018 Silver Eagle, Apostle Islands National Lakeshore rolls and bags, the three-coin set and five-ounce silver Uncirculated, and the 2018 US Mint Silver Proof and Uncirculated sets. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer will see the one-ounce Uncirculated Gold Eagle, a 2018 San Francisco minted Silver Eagle Proof coin, Cumberland Island quarter products, the 2018 50th Anniversary San Francisco Silver Reverse Proof Set, and the Voyageurs National Park releases. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the fall, we will see the 2018 American Palladium Eagle Proof Coin, the ATB Circulating Coin Set, Block Island quarter releases, the 2018 Limited Edition Silver Proof Set, and the Breast Cancer Awareness Coin and Stamp Set. </span>]]></content>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar climbed higher today, supported by news that the Senate approved a budget and there is a new hope that interest rates will go up in December, and rise a few more times in 2018. Gold price turned lower on Friday as the dollar regained value and U.S. Senate approved a plan for the 2018 fiscal year. Among other precious metals: silver and platinum prices slightly dropped, palladium price increased.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Friday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2568.98 (+0.27%) and NASDAQ Index 6663.18 (+0.43%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 23212.15 (+0.24%).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street indexes are trading higher today as the Republican-controlled Senate voted for the budget measure late on Thursday and add $1,5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a report that Trump is considering Jerome Powell as the next Fed chair has given some support to the dollar earlier in the session and weighed down the gold prices.</span>

		<title>Changes at the Federal Reserve?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two important events are unfolding at the largest central bank in the world within the next two weeks:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/06/19/fed-rate-hike-and-gold/">The Fed gathers to set interest rate</a> and monetary policy at its once-per-six weeks meeting: on October 31 – November 1.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Trump is due to announce his candidate for the new Fed chair, and thus by default likely ousting current chairwoman Janet Yellen.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Rate Hike Odds</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the interest rate front, the futures market is pricing in overwhelming odds that there will be no hike at the coming meeting. The odds are 98.5% that the Fed maintains the current target rate, at 1.00% - 1.25%, as seen in the probability chart at right:  </span>

<img class="wp-image-2894 aligncenter" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/a_prob.png" alt="a_prob" width="452" height="294" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, our proprietary Fed-watch indicator, which relies on 3-month US Treasury yields as a leading signal for Fed interest rate hikes, is offering a slightly different perspective. [For context: 3-month yields have generally been rising 1-2 months before each Fed rate hike, as can be seen by the green highlights below.]</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note how although yields are still not back to their short-term July peak, they are indeed steadily rising again (blue callout):</span>

<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2895" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/b_3mo_gold.png" alt="b_3mo_gold" width="579" height="599" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If yields meet or exceed their July peak at 1.15 before December, we predict the Fed will indeed hike by another 0.25% at the December meeting.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The critical point on the above chart is to recall that each Fed rate hike since 2015 (itself the first in a decade) has witnessed a sequentially higher associated <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> price (black arrows, above). Thus, the expectation of another rate hike to come deserves our continued monitoring.</span>
<h3><b>Yellen Out?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chairwoman Yellen’s term is set to expire in February. Reports over the last week from unnamed Fed officials have hinted that Trump may choose to not renew Yellen’s term. The leading replacement candidate is Jerome Powell, who is currently a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2896" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/c_Fedchair-1.png" alt="c_Fedchair (1)" width="624" height="223" />
<h3><b>Yellen to be replaced by Powell?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If Trump indeed chooses to not renew Yellen’s position, it will mark the shortest tenure of a Fed chair since    G. William Miller was ousted by President Carter in 1979 after less than 18 months in office.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Steven Beckner, a Federal Reserve analyst, offered this summary on Miller’s short time in service at the Fed:</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under Arthur Burns, who chaired the Fed from 1970 to 1978, and under G. William Miller, who was chairman… to August 1979, the Fed provided the monetary fuel for an inflation that began as a flicker and grew into a fearsome blaze... If Nixon appointee Burns lit the fire, Miller poured gasoline on it during the administration of President Jimmy Carter. Without question, the most partisan and least respected chairman in the Fed's history, this former Textron executive worked in tandem with fellow Carter appointee, Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal, in pursuit of monetary policies that were expansionist domestically and devaluationist internationally. The goals were to spur employment and exports, with little thought to the dollar's value. By early 1980, inflation was running at 14 percent per year.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">May we then ask: why do reports suggest that Yellen will have the shortest term since Miller, who was responsible for the highest inflation rate in US history? What is occurring inside the central bank to cause Trump’s apparent distrust of Yellen? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A non-renewal after just one term in office is as close to firing a Fed chair as possible without the political embarrassment associated. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Something is not right within the US executive branch / Federal Reserve relationship. We suspect that recent analysis showing a long-term top being put into place in the US dollar is partly related to this instability within the central bank, which may be further expressed within the next two weeks in a Yellen departure announcement.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two central banks have previously been dissolved in the history of the United States. Stay tuned – the lasting success of this institution is not written in stone.</span>

		<title>Daily Market Review - October, 23</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"><b><i>Gold Price</i></b></a><b><i> increased to $1,283.50 (+0.20%) per ounce,</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price"><b><i> Silver Price</i></b></a><b><i> $17.16 (+0.76%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/platinum-price"><b><i> Platinum Price</i></b></a><b><i> $931.60 (+0.26%),</i></b><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/palladium-price"><b><i> Palladium Price</i></b></a><b><i> $959.85 (-0.52%), Dow Jones index 23,273.96 (0.22% decrease).</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a new week ahead, with the big news for earnings, the economy, and taxes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, the government will release its first reading of third-quarter GDP, an accounting of all the goods and services the economy produces. The world will also see the monetary policy decisions from the eurozone and Brazilian central banks. Many Wall Street traders worry that the Trump administration would be able to achieve its hopes to cut corporate and personal taxes and reform before the end of 2017.</span>
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Dollar is trading higher in early trading Monday. The dollar index hit a two-week high overnight. The greenback started this week on the pretty positive way. Gold price hit its lowest level in two weeks on Monday, weighed down by a firm dollar and stronger Asian equities. Among other precious metals:  silver price increased, platinum price is also higher, palladium price slightly moved back.</span>
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Monday opened lower S&amp;P 500 2564.98 (-0.40%) and NASDAQ Index 6586.93 (-0.64%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 23273.96 (-0.22%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Indexes are trading lower today, as traders and investors are anticipating who will be President Trump’s nominee for the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Jerome Powell has moved to the top of the list among many other candidates. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There's no news on North Korea this last week, and investors hope gold might be supported but at the moment traders are just watching the dollar. </span>

<b>Economic data for this week: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Fed National Activity </span><b>(Monday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Markit Manufacturing PMI, Markit Services PMI </span><b>(Tuesday)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Durable Goods Orders, New Home Sales </span><b>(Wednesday), </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekly Jobless Claims, Advance Trade in goods, Pending Home Sales</span><b> (Thursday),  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gross Domestic Product, Consumer Sentiment</span><b> (Friday).</b>]]></content>

		<title>ScotiaMocatta Scandal Gaining Steam</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The world’s oldest <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> trader, ScotiaMocatta, which has roots dating back to the 17th century, went on sale on Wednesday, the decision stemming from a scandal that has shocked the global bullion market. Mocatta Bullion was purchased by Scotiabank in 1997 and has existed since 1671. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">News outlets have been following the massive money laundering charges that have come to light and will most certainly have a huge effect in some of the biggest players in the business. The Canada Bank of Nova Scotia has been testing the waters on finding a buyer for its <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> business- ScotiaMocatta. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This money laundering story, that a US refinery was part of a smuggling of gold from South America, has greatly affected many and has left the future of ScotiaMocatta very uncertain over the past few months. ScotiaBank may even have been searching for a buyer for close to a year and has been decreasing its business in case a sale doesn’t go through soon. JPMorgan has been put in charge of the sale of this mainstay in precious metals trading, and they seem to be eyeing China as a potential buyer at this time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">March sealed this sale, when Scotiabank made a loan to Elemental, a refinery in Texas, and set itself apart as one of their biggest lenders. When US prosecutors subsequently accused NTR Metals, a subsidiary of Elemental, of laundering billions of dollars of criminal gold, most of which came from Peru, Scotiabank’s fate was decided. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This story has garnered a lot of interest because of its slightly surreal aspects, like the fact that this Elemental subsidiary allegedly imported more than 3.6 billion dollars of gold from Latin America in the four year time period of 2012 to 2015. Two men involved, Samer Barrage and Juan Granda, pled guilty in September to money laundering plea deals. Following this, Elemental was booted from the London Bullion Market Association's “Good Delivery List” of gold refiners. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to come back from being removed from this list, as gold buyers tend to only buy gold from those that are part of it. Shortly after Elemental was removed, the Comex futures exchange in New York announced that it would no longer accept gold from Elemental for delivery against futures contracts. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This announcement along with the rising tide of scandal made it impossible for those with Elemental gold to sell their gold bars, leaving them stuck in banks, stated traders in the Financial Times. Buyers are also hesitant to take on any of this gold. Because of this, hundreds of millions of dollars in loans given to Elemental from ScotiaMocatta are left in limbo. Additionally, one of the five bullion banks that work in gold with the largest market, London, has been blackballed. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">HSBC and JPMorgan are prepared to step into Mocatta’s empty spot on the London market with their ability to provide credit to clients and refiners worldwide. They also provide an additional benefit that Scotiabank could not, which are their London vaults. The London gold market is estimated at approximately 5 trillion dollars a year, even though no exact number of how much gold is traded daily is available. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Scotiabank has the largest foreign presence of any Canadian bank and is currently looking towards the Pacific Alliance, a Latin American trade bloc made up of Mexico, Peru, Chile, and Colombia. For now, it will continue to look for a Chinese buyer for this compromised gold trading operation.</span>]]></content>

		<title>New Piece of Platinum Proof Series Announced by US Mint</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by the Declaration of Independence, a three-year program entitled “Preamble to the Declaration of Independence Platinum Proof Coin Series” was announced yesterday. This series will begin in 2018 and will feature one-ounce proof coins of 99.95% platinum with new, updated designs. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Proof coins go through a specialized minting process, where first burnished coin blanks are fitted into presses with special dies. The coin goes through multiple strikes which achieves a floating image effect over a mirrored field. Inspectors then scrutinize the quality of each coin before placing them in a protective plastic capsule and mounting them in a satin-lined velvet case. These coins will come along with an official Certificate of Authenticity and sell at a fixed price. The $100 face value of the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum/coins/american-platinum-eagle">American Eagle Platinum</a> Proof Coin sets it apart as the highest denomination of any US legal tender coin. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Mint has also made available uncirculated versions of the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins/gold-american-eagle/gold-eagles">gold</a> and <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/coins/us-silver-coins/american-silver-eagles">silver American Eagles</a> for collectors, which feature the same designs as the proof versions. Uncirculated coins can be distinguished by their mint marks which show where they were minted. They undergo minting in burnished coin blanks, which are fed one by one by hand into specifically adapted presses. These coins are also carefully inspected before they are put into a protective plastic and then within a box. A Certificate of Authenticity accompanies each of these coins.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/2017-w-1-oz-platinum-american-eagle-proof-coin-w-box-coa">American Eagle One Ounce Platinum Proof Coin</a> was first released in 1997 and has always featured the same obverse, a Liberty portrait. The reverse has cycled through different themes, including “Vistas of Liberty”, “Foundations of Democracy”, “The Preamble to the Constitution”, and “Torches of Liberty”. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The third decade of this program will see updated obverse designs concurrently designed by the same person, Justin Kunz, along with a new shared reverse design. This series has been designed to reflect the foundation of American principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, as listed in the Preamble to the Declaration of Independence. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2018 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">release</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carries the Life theme and showcases Lady Liberty planting seeds in a field alongside a child. She carries a sword to symbolize the defense of life. The field around her symbolizes the labor and thought necessary to sustain life. The tree and stream in the background portray nature and the importance of being a good steward of the environment around us. The obverse of this coin is inscribed with “LIFE”, “IN GOD WE TRUST”, “E PLURIBUS UNUM”, “LIBERTY”, and the year of mintage.  </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2937" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Life-2018.jpg" alt="Life 2018" width="450" height="250" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2019 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">release</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> celebrates Liberty and features Lady Liberty standing tall over prairies, lakes, and mountains. The rough terrain in the background calls on the American spirit of exploration and the freedom to search for new places, ideas, and ways of life. Lady Liberty’s lips are parted, symbolizing freedom of speech, and the torch she carries acts as a guiding light. She also holds a book to show the need for law and equality. The obverse will be inscribed with “LIBERTY”, “IN GOD WE TRUST”, “E PLURIBUS UNUM”, and “2019”.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2938" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Liberty-2019.jpg" alt="Liberty 2019" width="450" height="250" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2020 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">release</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> commemorates the third and final American principle, the Pursuit of Happiness. This coin shows Lady Liberty at work harvesting a rich bounty with a girl at her side. Her bounty symbolizes that which liberty makes possible. The buildings standing behind her symbolize the American path, and the final step of the story shown throughout the series- from the furrowed field to mountains to home and farm. The representative of the hard work and ingenuity needed for success, this third coin wraps up the series. The obverse will carry the inscriptions “HAPPINESS”, “IN GOD WE TRUST”, “E PLURIBUS UNUM”, “LIBERTY”, and the year of mintage.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2939" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Happiness-2020.jpg" alt="Happiness 2020" width="450" height="250" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All will share a reverse design of an eagle soaring with an olive branch gripped in its talons, crafted by AIP Designer Patricia Lucas-Morris. They will all be composed of 99.95% platinum and will carry the “W” mintmark. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can follow us on social media or subscribe to our newsletter for getting all additional information on this program.</span>]]></content>

		<title>Gold or Silver – Which One to Choose?</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently I needed to sell some of my long-term precious metals holdings. The reason? To pay for some unforeseen business expenses.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the prospect of selling some physical metals first dawned on me, at first I felt resistance to the idea. How could I sell now, at current prices? What if prices rose after I sold? Would it be better to sell my <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price"></a>or <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/silver-price">silver</a>? Maybe I should take out a business loan instead?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These were all questions that arose soon after I began to contemplate the logistics of the transaction. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And they are important questions: after all, some of these precious metals I have been holding for well over a decade.   </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, I decided that I would indeed sell the metals as opposed to taking out a loan. While one could argue that with today’s low-interest rates, I might have been better off locking in a low-rate loan, it felt more sound for me to pay for the expense outright at this juncture. Perhaps the value of keeping life simple is worth more than a specific amount of dollars during certain time periods.</span>
<h3><b>Questions to Ask Oneself</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In completing the transaction, I began to review how many personal factors go into the decision to buy or sell precious metals. In this series of articles, we often focus on macroeconomic trends and price analysis, but there is an equally important number of personal factors that must go into each individual’s investment planning:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, let us consider the simple question of choosing whether to invest primarily in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> or in <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver">silver</a> (or <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-platinum">platinum</a> or <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-palladium">palladium</a> for that matter). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What on the surface seems like it should be a simple question is often found to require a multi-faceted thought process. For example, one must consider:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Does one intend to hold the metals personally, or have them stored in a vault? </b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of holding the metals personally are that one does not have to pay for storage, and no third party ever has a record of the transaction, so privacy is maintained. However, the downsides are that <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/how-to/where-to-hide-bullion-home">storage space</a> may be limited, and one’s living space may not be suitable for this. Concerns of theft may also exist. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And indeed, at the present gold to silver ratio of 75-1, the amount of personal space and/or fees required to store $10,000 worth of gold (approximately equivalent to eight 1-ounce coins) is extremely small compared to the space needed to store the same dollar amount of silver (560 1-ounce coins). These practical considerations are paramount for some.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>What are the individual’s risk tolerance and time horizon? </b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold is known to be more stable in value than silver – both when the metals are rising and when they are falling. For example, from the December 2015 low in both metals to the July 2016 highs, gold rose 32%, from $1,045 per ounce to $1,378. Meanwhile, silver rose 56% over the same timeframe, from $13.65 per ounce to $21.25. Clearly a nice outperformance by silver.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, let us consider another time period: 2011 – 2015. From gold’s peak in 2011 at $1,923 to its low over four years later at $1,045, the metal lost 45% of its value. Meanwhile, silver, which peaked at $49 in 2011, lost an incredible 72% in falling down to $13.65.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The point is: in choosing between gold and silver, an individual’s own time horizon and risk tolerance must be weighed. In a rising metals-price backdrop, silver tends to lag gold initially, and then play catch up on a greater percentage basis later in time. It may, therefore, be more appropriate for long-term investors with a higher risk tolerance. However, when the metals fall, gold tends to hold its value more so than silver. Gold provides a buffer to the extreme volatility of silver’s fluctuations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These two broad topics – storage and risk tolerance – are just two of the important issues an investor must ask himself when engaging in physical precious metals transactions. Of course, there are other considerations as well: premiums paid above spot price, taxes, and the ability to easily travel and/or barter with the metals are all factors that may or may not be important for an individual.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, there is never anyone right or wrong answer – the questions lie with the individual. No single plan of action will serve all investors. A realistic examination of one’s own goals and tolerances for risk must be considered:</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Know thyself.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">-Ancient Greek proverb, Temple of Apollo at Delphi</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2954" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/a_Delphi.png" alt="" width="706" height="469" />
<h3><b>Which Did I Choose?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So in the end, which did I end up selling to pay for the business expenses: gold or silver?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not what I prior thought I might have sold in such a situation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While I do have a long-term time horizon, and my risk tolerance is high, I actually choose to sell some silver to raise my funds.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? I’m planning a move in the near future, and the thought of discreetly carrying a few <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins">gold coins</a> with me to my new home was more appealing than transporting a box with hundreds of ounces of <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/bars">silver</a> to a new neighborhood.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, this might not have been the right choice for everyone – nor myself even in a different circumstance – but for the present moment, it was right for me.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the end, I felt a sense of gratitude to have had the capital – crystalized in precious metals form – available for when I needed it. Ultimately, I have seen that the disciplined accumulation of capital is one of the most powerful benefits of regularly investing in precious metals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Which do you choose as your precious metal of choice – gold or silver – and why?</span>

		<title>Bitcoin Hits $6,500 High for the first time ever.</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday saw an all-time high for bitcoin, setting a new record at $6500.00 at the time of writing. Bitcoin has been continually posting record highs of late, <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/10/12/bitcoin-hits-time-high/">breaking through $5,300 level</a>, but Wednesday's rise appears to be a new record, based on the price of bitcoin across the US, Japan, South Korea, and Europe.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders suggest this jump was caused by news that the exchange operator CME Group was planning to introduce bitcoin futures.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This year the price rise has been driven by increasing mainstream adoption and awareness of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally. At least 55 cryptocurrency hedge funds have sprung up this year, many of them focusing on bitcoin.  Bitcoin has been rising by over 500% against the dollar this year. However, traders suggest that the main factors affecting Bitcoin surrounding the possibility of the Chinese government, resuming cryptocurrency trading after the reelection of President Xi Jinping later this year, and the strong performance of the Japanese market have contributed to the price surge of bitcoin over the past weeks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin traders are also speculating that this week's bull run is partly helped by a new coming "<a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/08/01/bitcoin-forked-creating-new-bitcoin-cash/">fork</a>" in bitcoin's underlying software.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Differing predictions come from economists, but now may be a good time to report that bitcoin has had a great year. Sure, there have been some ups and downs, but bitcoin has been the clear winner. Furthermore, there have been increasing uses of bitcoin as legal tender around the world, and this trend would lead to hundreds of billions of dollars being allocated into bitcoin in the upcoming years and will allow bitcoin to achieve new highs.</span>

<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
The US Dollar Index is moving back today, followed the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold rates steady and some analysts report that President Donald Trump will appoint Jerome Powell as the next central bank chief. Gold prices increased on Thursday, supported by a weaker dollar as investors waited for the nomination of a new Fed chair and the results of U.S. tax reform legislation later today. Silver price is trading higher, platinum price slightly decreased, palladium price is also up.
<h3><b>Stock Market Today</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks on Thursday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2579.36 (+0.16%) and NASDAQ Index 6716.53 (-0.17%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 23435.01 (+0.25%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting this week (began Tuesday morning ended Wednesday afternoon) saw a very little reaction from the markets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A final Fed decision on Wednesday to leave interest rates unchanged didn’t cause any market collapse. Investor focus is now on the President Trump choice of the next Fed chair. It is expected that Governor Jerome Powell will replace Janet Yellen as leader of the central bank. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin breaks through $7,000 barrier on Thursday and is now more than 5x the price of gold. </span>

Here is a new week ahead, with features reading on inflation from China, retail sales from Europe and consumer sentiment from U.S., as well as speeches by Fed officials. Investors will get a few more clues about the direction of the economy. President Trump has an international trip through the Asia-Pacific region to drum up economic development. The tour begins in Japan, where Trump will meet with Emperor Akihito. Then President heads off to South Korea, China, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Hawaii. Now markets know who will be the next Fed chair and where the central bank stands on the economy.
<h3><b>U.S. Dollar vs Precious metals</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Dollar was trading higher today, supported by the weaker euro. Gold price increased today after upbeat US economic data and further interest rate hike announced by the Federal Reserve. Among other precious metals: silver price also slightly increased, palladium and platinum prices decreased today. </span><b> </b>
<h3><strong>Stock Market Today</strong></h3>
U.S. stocks on Monday opened higher S&amp;P 500 2588.17 (+0.03%) and NASDAQ Index 6778.49 (+0.22%), Dow Jones Industrial Average 23540.88 (+0.01%).
<p style="text-align: left;">Wall Street Indexes are trading higher today, with adding positive earnings reports to tech stocks and the new tax-reform plan, which cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, will send an important message to U.S. stock markets.
In the week ahead, investors will hear from a few top Fed officials and get some idea of what may come ahead in U.S. economy. This week's Fedspeak calendar will feature the first public remarks from the newest member.
Bitcoin price target lately raised to $7,500 during the early market sessions, and market analytics suggest the price will not stop here in the nearest future.</p>

		<title>Central Bank Shake-Ups Around the World</title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although we are primarily focused here on <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/charts/gold-price">gold</a> as priced in US dollars – as this remains the standard by which international traders and mining companies mark their assets – we remain cognizant that a worldwide movement of capital into precious metals is what will account for the bull market that we believe is just in the beginning stages of developing. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus we look elsewhere around the globe periodically. This past week the Bank of England under Governor Mark Carney raised interest rates by 0.25% to a new mark of 0.50%. While the fact that this was the first interest rate hike in the UK in 10 years is getting most of the mainstream attention, what is not being highlighted is that interest rates still remain at the lowest levels </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ever recorded</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the British monetary system. Below we show the Bank of England prime rate from the abolishment of the Bretton Woods <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold">gold</a> standard in 1971 (when currencies were allowed to float freely versus the <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/07/31/us-dollar-approaching-critical-support/">US dollar</a>) through the present:</span>

[caption id="attachment_2979" align="aligncenter" width="737"]<img class="wp-image-2979 size-full" title="Interest rates rise to 0.5%" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/a_UK_int.png" alt="" width="737" height="530" /> Interest rates rise to 0.5%[/caption]

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We must also note: not only have interest rates been held lower from 2007 through present than any time in modern history, but they have also remained lower than the rate the Bank of England set during World War II (2.0%). Can we truly fathom that </span><b>England’s banking authorities deemed the nation’s economy to be in worse condition over the past 10 years than during the deadliest conflict in all of human history?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the unprecedented nature of the time we live in.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those new to central banking should know that the controlling organization does not simply have a lever to pull to lower interest rates at will. No – central banks must continually print money to buy short-term bonds in order to keep interest rates suppressed below the level at which the market would naturally set. This is a principal reason why low-interest rates are inflationary: money is continually being created each month as the central banks hold rates down.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be no surprise then that M3 money supply in the UK – the broadest measure of the total quantity of British pounds in existence – has nearly doubled since 2007, and indeed, is up over 5-fold since 1992:</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2980" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/b_UKMS.png" alt="UK Money supply" width="892" height="412" />
<h3><b>Trump Nominates Powell</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile on the other side of the Atlantic, President Trump this past week has finalized his nomination for new <a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/2017/10/23/changes-at-the-federal-reserve/">Federal Reserve chair</a>: Jerome Powell. In recent weeks we covered how – if Powell is indeed confirmed – current chairwoman Yellen will have been “terminated” after the shortest tenure as Fed chair since G. William Miller presided over the highest inflation rate (14%) in US history in the late 1970’s.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2981" src="https://bullionexchanges.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/c_Powell.png" alt="c_Powell" width="426" height="300" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What more, Powell was originally selected as a Fed governor under the Obama administration, thus showing us that when it comes to central banking, the Democrat /Republican divide exists in name only: </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Janet Yellen “should be ashamed of herself” for creating “a false stock market” [by keeping interest rates low].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">-Donald Trump, September 2016.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do like the low-interest rate policy… I have a lot of respect” [for Yellen].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">-Donald Trump, July 2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line in central banking is: support primarily exists for Fed member banks at all costs. Everything else – consumer price inflation, unemployment, the value of the currency – comes secondarily.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most major markets were little changed on Thursday / Friday on the news that Yellen will be replaced by Powell – indicating that the status quo of sufficient money-printing to maintain the solvency of member banks will remain in place even when the new chair takes office in February 2018.</span>
<h3><b>Gold Price Update</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/bars/">Gold</a> remains in the midst of its long-term downtrend retest zone. For the week, the historic store of wealth finished lower by a fraction, down 0.2% or $3 to finish at $1,269 as of the final trade on the New York COMEX on Friday afternoon. As precious metals investors, we must primarily focus on the main gold chart at all times, and nothing about the technical action over the past week has changed the fact that a 6-year downtrend (magenta line) is now in the process of retesting its breakout point. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bullionexchanges.com/buy-gold/us-gold-coins/">Gold</a> is attempting to establish a new trend. We must let this retesting process play out:</span>
